This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended prim arily for use in calibration and performance evaluation of 
instruments used to determine molecular weight and molecular weight distribution by size exclusion chromatography 
(SEC) or gel filtration chromatography.  SRM 1923 is supplied in the form of a white powder, and in units of 0.2 g. 
 
This material is certified for weight-average molecular weight (Mw): 
 
Mw = 26.9 x 103 ± 2.2 x 103 g/molea 
 
aCombined expanded uncertainty, U (see Table 1). 
 
The above uncertainty was calculated by a procedure complying with the description in NIST Technical Note 1297 [1]. 
  
 
Source:  This poly(ethylene oxide) was prepared by Polymer Labs, Church Stretton, Shropshire, England. 
 
Expiration of Certification:   This certificate will be valid for five years from the date of shipment from NIST, when 
maintained under recommended storage conditions. 
 
Homogeneity and Material Characterization:   The homogeneity of the polymer was tested by SEC analysis of 
solutions in water at 30  °C.  The M w was determined by Rayleigh light scattering.  The M w/Mn ratio (Mn is the number 
average molecular weight) was estimated as 1.06 from the SE
poly(ethylene oxide) by SEC and by light scattering is described in NISTIR 5286 [2]. 
 
A high molecular weight peak, distinctly  remote from the main peak, occasiona lly appeared in chromatograms during 
an aging study of this poly(ethylene oxide) by aqueous SE C.  The high molecular weight peak can be removed by 
heating the solution at 50 °C for 1 h.  In order to avoid degradation, solutions of the standard should be freshly prepared 
before each SEC calibration. 
 
Storage:  SRM 1923 is provided bottled in an environment of dry  argon.  The polymer sample should be stored in the 
original bottle tightly closed, under normal laboratory conditions. 
 
The technical coordination leading to certification of this material was provided by C.C. Han, with technical 
measurement and data interpretation provided by C.M. Guttman and J.R. Maurey, all of the NIST Polymers Division. 
 
Technical and support aspects involved in the preparation, 
through the Standard Reference Materials Program by J.C. Colbert.

Combined standard uncertainty:  uc = 1.09 x 103 g/mole by root-sum-of-squares of ui [2].
