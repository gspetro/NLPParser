Certificate of Analysis 
 
Standard Reference Material® 2861 
 
Restricted Elements in Polyvinyl Chloride 

Poly 

 
This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  use  in  validation  of  chemical  and  instrumental 
methods of analysis of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and materials of similar matrix for restricted, additive and tramp 
element contents.  It can be used to validate value assignment of in-house reference materials.  A unit of SRM 2861 
consists of one bottle containing approximately 25 g of PVC pellets. 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values:   Certified values for constituents of SRM 2861 are reported in Table 1 as mass 
fractions of the elements in a PVC  matrix [1].  A NIST certified value is a  value  for  which NIST has the highest 
confidence in its accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been taken into account [2].  A certified 
value is the present best estimate of the true value.  The certified values are the measurands and are metrologically 
traceable  to  the  SI  derived  unit  of  mass  fraction  (expressed  as  percent).    The  expanded  uncertainty  estimates  are 
expressed at a confidence level of approximately 95 %.

ING,  STORAGE,  AND  USE 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
Polyvinyl chloride pellets may be analyzed either in as-received form, cryogenically ground to powder for methods 
requiring  dissolution,  or  melt  pressed  for  methods  that  require  a  larger  area  of  measurement,  such  as  X-ray 
fluorescence  spectrometry (XRF).    To  relate  analytical  determinations  to  the  certified  values  in  this  Certificate  of 
Analysis, a minimum test portion of 100 mg should be used when it has been prepared as powder.  See below for 
additional  information  on  melt  pressing  and  exposure  to  X-rays.    A  bottle  containing  unused  material  should  be 
recapped immediately and stored at room temperature away from light. 
 
To  use  the  uncertainty  estimates  given  in  this  certificate,  divide  the  expanded  uncertainty  by  k = 2  to  obtain  the 
combined standard uncertainty.  The effective degrees of freedom of the combined standard uncertainty are ≥60. 
 
Heterogeneity of SRM 2861 is such that measurements of very small quantities will be subject to high variance.  The 
elements Ba, Fe, and Se are characterized by discrete locations of high concentrations.  These locations range in size 
from approximately 50 µm to several hundred micrometers, and they may contain 10 times to 100 times the overall 
mass fraction of the element.  Multiple measurements of small spots on a sample may exhibit widely varying results.  
To obtain a test result representative of the overall composition of SRM 2861, the user must make measurements of 
different locations until the mean of the measurements and the standard deviation no longer change. 
 
CAUTION TO USERS 
 
Polyvinyl chloride is damaged by exposure to X-rays of  sufficient power density  for a sufficient duration.  When 
radiation damage is suspected, do not make repeat measurements of the same location of a specimen.  Both microbeam 
XRF and high power wavelength dispersive XRF spectrometers use direct excitation and cause sufficient damage to 
alter the composition of the PVC.  An energy dispersive XRF spectrometer of the secondary target design may not 
damage the PVC.  Damage from irradiation is characterized by discoloration of the PVC that may be accompanied by 
a faint odor of burned material.  Sample mass loss may be observed.  Excessive irradiation was observed to cause loss 
of Cl and Hg from SRM 2861 as well as reduction of the hexavalent Cr originally added as Na2Cr2O7 prior to extrusion.  
Losses of Cl and Hg can be observed as decreasing X-ray count rates from repeat measurements.  Increasing count 
rates for Ca were observed when Cl was lost.   
 
ADDITIONAL CONSTITUENTS:  Noncertified values are provided for the following additional constituents in 
61. 
SRM 2861. 
 
Information Mass Fraction Values:  Information values for constituents in SRM 2861 are reported as mass fractions 
in Table 2.  An information value is a value that may be of interest to the SRM user, but insufficient information is 
available  to  assess  the  uncertainty  associated  with  the  value [2].    Information  values  cannot  be  used  to  establish 
metrological traceability.  The information values reported in Table 2 for Cl and Na were determined using a single 
test  method  at  one  laboratory:    Cl  by  XRF  and  Na  by  inductively  coupled  plasma  optical  emission 
spectrometry (ICPOES).  The values listed for Br and Cu are the estimated limits of detection of both test methods.  
These two elements were not added intentionally to this PVC formulation.  The information provided for hexavalent 
Cr was determined using laboratory-based, high resolution XRF [6].

PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
The material for SRM 2861 was prepared by combining a master blend with a dry blend in a mixer at 85 ºC, followed 
by  extrusion  at  175 ºC,  cooling  in  a  water  bath  and  chopping,  then  a  second  extrusion,  cooling,  and  chopping.  
Blending and extrusion were performed by Polymers Center of Excellence (Charlotte, NC).  The master blend was 
prepared from virgin PVC powder to which organometallic compounds of Ba, Cd, Hg, and Pb, an aqueous solution 
of Na2Cr4O7 (containing a surfactant), and a copper phthalocyanine bromide dye were added.  The dry blend consisted 
of PVC with added CaCO3 and methyltin mercaptide.  The approximate density of SRM 2861 is 1.3 g/cm3.  The PVC 
pellets were blended and bottled at NIST. 
 
Homogeneity testing was performed at NIST using XRF to measure disks made from 6.2 g of pellets melt-pressed at 
175 ºC.  Additional evaluation of heterogeneity was performed using microXRF at NIST.  Material heterogeneity was 
sufficiently low for value assignment.  Quantitative determinations were done at NIST by XRF after melt-pressing 
and at collaborating laboratories by ICPOES after cryogenic grinding and microwave-assisted acid digestion.   
 
Each certified value is a weighted mean of the results from the three laboratories [3].  The uncertainty listed with each 
certified value is an expanded uncertainty about the mean [4], with coverage factor, k = 2, calculated following the 
ISO/JCGM Guide [5]. 
 
Analyses leading to the certification of this SRM were performed at NIST by J.R. Sieber, J.L. Molloy, C. Bibb, and 
M. Boyce  of  the  NIST  Chemical  Sciences  Division.    Analytical  determinations  were  also  performed  by  D. Cobb, 
U.S. Consumer  Product  Safety  Commission (CPSC,  Rockville, MD);  C.S. Helt  and  K. Leung,  Underwriters 
Laboratories (Melville, NY); and E.P. Jahrman and G.T. Seidler, University of Washington (Seattle, WA). 
 
NOTICE TO USERS 
 
NIST strives to maintain the SRM inventory supply, but NIST cannot guarantee the continued or continuous supply 
of any specific SRM.  Accordingly, NIST encourages the use of this SRM as a primary benchmark for the quality and 
accuracy  of  the  user’s  in-house  reference  materials  and  working  standards.    As  such,  the  SRM  should  be  used  to 
validate the more routinely used reference materials in a laboratory.  Comparisons between the SRM and in-house 
reference materials or working measurement standards should take place at intervals appropriate to the conservation 
of  the  SRM  and  the  stability  of  relevant  in-house  materials.    For  further  guidance  on  how  this  approach  can  be 
implemented, contact NIST by email at srms@nist.gov.
