Certificate of Analysis 
Standard Reference Material 154c 

 

 

Titanium Dioxide 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended primarily for use in the evaluation of techniques employed in 
the assay of titanium dioxide in the paint and ceramic industries.  A unit of SRM 154c consists of a clear glass bottle 
containing 90 g of titanium dioxide (TiO2) as a fine powder (45 m). 
 
Certified Value:  The certified value, expressed as the mass fraction [1] of titanium dioxide (TiO2) on a dry basis 
(see  Drying  Instructions),  is  provided  below.    A  NIST  certified  value  is  a  value  for  which  NIST  has  the  highest 
confidence in its accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or accounted for by 
NIST. 
 

Titanium Dioxide (mass fraction):  99.591 %    0.062 % 

 
This  value  is  based  on  the  results  of  12  independent  coulometric  reductimetric  back-titrations [2]  performed  on  a 
stratified  random  sampled  set  of  8  units  of  SRM 154c  and  referenced  to  coulometrically  standardized  potassium 
dichromate (K2Cr2O7).  The dissolution and reduction procedure were adapted from American Society for Testing 
and  Materials (ASTM)  Standard  Method D1394-76 [3].    The  certified  value  includes  corrections  for  elements 
known  to  interfere  in  the  reduction  and  coulometric  titration  used  for  the  certification.    The  uncertainty  in  the 
certified  value  is  expressed  as  an  expanded  uncertainty,  U = kuc,  calculated  according  to  the  methods  in  the  ISO 
Guide [4].  The quantity uc represents, at the level of one standard deviation, the potential combined effects of the 
uncertainty  due  to  sample  dissolution  and  reduction,  coulometric  titration,  and  correction  for  impurities.    The 
quantity k is a coverage factor used to obtain an expanded uncertainty with an approximate confidence level of 95 %.  The 
value of the coverage factor, k = 2.004, is determined from the Student’s t-distribution with 55.05 degrees of freedom and 
a nominal confidence level of 95 %.  The certified value is based on mass in vacuum. Corrections for the effect of 
air buoyancy were calculated using a density of 4.28 g/cm3 for SRM 154c.  For use of SRM 154c as a calibration 
or  evaluation  standard,  it  is  the  responsibility  of  the  user  to  ascertain  which  elements  interfere  with  the 
procedure being calibrated or evaluated and to make corresponding corrections for the given application. 
 
Expiration  of  Certification:    The  certification  of  SRM 154c  is  valid,  within  the  measurement  uncertainties 
specified,  until  31 December 2020  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  the  instructions 
given in this certificate (see Instructions for (see “Instructions for Handling, Storage and Use”).  This certification is 
nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance  of  SRM  Certification:    NIST  will  monitor  this  SRM  over  the  period  of  its  certification.    If 
substantive  technical  changes  occur  that affect  the  certification before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST will 
notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
Coulometric analyses were performed by K.W. Pratt of the NIST Analytical Chemistry Division. 
 
Statistical consultation was provided by W.F. Guthrie of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division.

Division. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
Sampling:  The unit should be thoroughly mixed by rotating the bottle before sampling.  A minimum sample mass 
of  200 mg  should  be  used  for  analytical  determinations  to  be  related  to  the  certified  value  provided.    The  SRM 
should  be  stored,  as  received,  in  its  original  container  with  the  cap  tightly  closed,  under  normal  laboratory 
conditions. 
 
Drying:  A portion of SRM 154c should be dried for 2 hours at 110 °C prior to weighing the sample and stored in a 
desiccator over anhydrous magnesium perchlorate or equivalent desiccant, until analyzed. 
 
SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION 
 
Source of Material:  The titanium dioxide used for this SRM was donated by CPM Industries, Wilmington, DE.1 
The material has the characteristic off-white color of rutile and was stated by the supplier as an Ultra High Purity 
grade of rutile titanium dioxide with a nominal crystal structure of 99 % rutile. 
 
Information Values:  Noncertified impurity information values for SRM 154c are reported in Table 1. These values 
are  based  on  the  results  of  the  determination  of  impurity  trace  elements  in  SRM 154c  by  glow-discharge  mass 
spectrometry (GDMS).  The values are given to provide additional characterization of the material only. They are 
not recommended for use to monitor or assess analytical performance.
