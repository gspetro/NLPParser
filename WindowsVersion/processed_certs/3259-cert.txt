Certificate of Analysis 
Standard Reference Material® 3259 

 

 
Bitter Orange Extract 

 
This  Standard  Reference  Material  (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  use  in  validating  analytical  methods  for  the 
determination  of  alkaloids  in  bitter  orange  extract  and  similar  matrices.    This  SRM  can  also  be  used  for  quality 
assurance when assigning values to in-house control materials.  A unit of SRM 3259 consists of five packets, each 
containing approximately 1.2 g of extract. 
 
The  development  of  SRM  3259  was  a  collaboration  among  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology 
(NIST);  the  National  Institutes  of  Health  (NIH),  Office  of  Dietary  Supplements  (ODS);  and  the  Food  and  Drug 
Administration (FDA), Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER). 
 
Certified Concentration Values:  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in 
its accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [1].  The 
certified  concentration  values  of  selected  citrus  alkaloids  are  provided  in Table  1.   Values  were  derived  from  the 
combination of results provided by NIST and collaborating laboratories.  The certified values in this material are the 
equally  weighted  means  of  the  individual  sets  of  NIST  results  and  the  means  of  the  measurements  made  by 
collaborating laboratories where available; the associated uncertainties are expanded uncertainties at the 95 % level of 
confidence [2,3].  Values are reported on a dry-mass basis in mass fraction units [4]. 
 
Reference Concentration Values:  Reference values are noncertified values that are the best estimate of the true 
values  based  on  available  data;  however,  the  values  do  not  meet  the  NIST  criteria  for  certification  [1]  and  are 
provided  with  associated  uncertainties  that  may  reflect  only  measurement  reproducibility,  may  not  include  all 
sources of uncertainty, or may reflect a lack of sufficient statistical agreement among multiple analytical methods.  
The reference concentration values for octopamine is  provided in Table 2.   
 
Information Concentration Values:  An information value is a value that may be of interest to the SRM user, but 
insufficient information is available to assess the uncertainty associated with the value therefore no uncertainty is 
provided.    Information  concentration  values  for  hordenine  and  toxic  elements  are  provided  in  Tables  3  and  4, 
respectively. 
 
Expiration of Value Assignment:  The value assignment of this SRM is valid until 30 September 2014, within the 
measurement uncertainties specified, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions 
given in this certificate.  Value assignment is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, or modified. 
 
Coordination of the technical measurements leading to the certification of this SRM was performed by L.C. Sander, 
K.E. Sharpless, and S.A. Wise of the NIST Analytical Chemistry Division. 
 
Support  for  the  development  of  SRM  3259  was  provided  in  part  by  NIH  ODS  and  FDA  CDER.    Technical 
consultation was provided by J.M. Betz (NIH ODS) and A. NguyenPho (FDA CDER). 
 
Acquisition  of  the  material  was  coordinated  by  A.  NguyenPho  of  FDA  CDER  and  K.E.  Sharpless  of  the  NIST 
Analytical Chemistry Division.

Maintenance of SRM Value Assignment:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its value assignment.  If 
substantive technical changes occur that affect the value assignment before the expiration of this certificate, NIST 
will notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
NOTICE AND WARNING TO USERS 
 
Storage:  The material should be stored at controlled room temperature (20 °C to 25 °C), in an unopened packet, until 
required for use.   
 
Warning:  For laboratory use only.  Not for human consumption.   
 
Instructions for Use:  Prior to removal of a test portion for analysis, the contents of a packet of material should be 
mixed thoroughly.  For certified values to be valid, test portions of the powder between 0.05 g and 0.5 g should be 
used for alkaloid analysis.  For analysis of toxic elements, test portions greater than or equal to 0.3 g should be used.  
Test  portions  should  be  analyzed  as  received  and  results  converted  to  a  dry-mass  basis  by  determining  moisture 
content  (using  one  of  the  methods  described  below)  on  a  separate  test  portion.    The  stability  of  alkaloids  in 
previously opened packets has not been investigated. 
 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS1 
 
Material Acquisition and Preparation:  Twelve kilograms of bitter orange extract for production of SRM 3259 
was obtained from Sinochem Ningbo Ltd. (Ningbo, China) through Modern Nutrition and Biotech (Appleton, WI) 
and were received by NIST directly from the manufacturer in China. The powdered extract was transferred to High-
Purity  Solutions  (Charleston,  SC)  where  it  was  aliquotted  and  heat-sealed  inside  nitrogen-flushed  4  mil 
polyethylene bags, which were then sealed inside nitrogen-flushed aluminized plastic bags along with two packets 
of silica gel each.  Following packaging, SRM 3259 was irradiated (Neutron Products, Inc.; Dickerson, MD) to an 
absorbed dose of 7.4 kGy to 9.0 kGy.   
 
Determination of Citrus Alkaloids:  Value assignment of the concentrations of the citrus alkaloids in SRM 3259 
was based on the combination of measurements from four different analytical methods at NIST and two sets of data 
provided  by  collaborating  laboratories.    NIST  provided  alkaloid  data  by  using  a  combination  of  two  extraction 
techniques  (sonication,  pressurized-fluid  extraction)  and  four  liquid  chromatography  (LC)  methods  with  different 
detection  (i.e.,  ultraviolet  absorbance  [UV],  fluorescence  [FL],  mass  spectrometry  [MS],  and  tandem  mass 
spectrometry [MS/MS]).  NCTR and ChromaDex generated data by using LC/UV [5,6].   
 
NIST Analyses for Citrus Alkaloids:  Citrus alkaloids were measured at NIST by using sonication extraction with 
LC/UV and LC/FL [7], pressurized-fluid extraction with LC/MS [8], and sonication extraction with LC/MS/MS [9].  
Independently prepared calibrants were used for each of the methods.  Calibrants were prepared gravimetrically, at 
levels intended to approximate the levels of the alkaloids in the SRM.  A single internal standard solution was used 
for the calibrants and samples.   
 
Sample Preparation − Sonication Method 1:  Two 0.50 g test portions from each of six packets were individually 
combined  with  an  internal  standard  solution  containing  terbutaline  and  dilute  aqueous  hydrochloric  acid  (0.37  % 
mass  fraction),  mixed,  and  placed  in  an  ultrasonicating  bath  for  60  minutes.    The  mixture  was  centrifuged,  the 
supernatant was removed, and the residue was re-extracted into dilute hydrochloric acid using the same procedure.  

                                                           

1Certain  commercial  equipment,  instruments,  or  materials  are  identified  in  this  report  to  specify  adequately  the 
experimental  procedure.    Such  identification  does  not  imply  recommendation  or  endorsement  by  the  National  Institute  of 
Standards and Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the 
purpose.

Supernatants were combined, and samples were analyzed by LC/UV and LC/FL, with the two detectors connected 
in series.   
 
Sample Preparation − Pressurized-Fluid Extraction (PFE):  Two 0.05 g test portions from each of six packets were 
individually  combined  with  an  internal  standard  solution  containing  terbutaline  and  dilute  aqueous  hydrochloric 
acid (0.37 % mass fraction), mixed, and extracted by PFE using two extraction cycles. Samples were diluted with 
water and analyzed by using LC/MS. 
 
Sample Preparation − Sonication Method 2:  Two 50 mg test portions from each of six packets were individually 
combined with an internal standard solution containing terbutaline and dilute aqueous hydrochloric acid (1 % mass 
fraction),  mixed,  and  placed  in  an  ultrasonicating  bath  for  60  min.  The mixture was centrifuged, the supernatant 
was  removed,  and  the  residue  was  re-extracted  into  dilute  hydrochloric  acid  using  the  same  procedure.  
Supernatants were combined and samples were analyzed by using LC/MS/MS. 
 
LC/UV and LC/FL:  LC/UV and LC/FL were performed with the absorbance and fluorescence detectors connected 
in series.  Analytes were separated on a C18 column with a mobile phase of 72 % 10 mmol/L sodium dodecyl sulfate 
(pH  2.5)  and  28  %  acetonitrile  (volume  fractions).      Absorbance  was  monitored  at  220  nm.    An  excitation 
wavelength  of  273  nm  and  an  emission  wavelength  of  304  nm  were  used  for  fluorescence  detection.    Typical 
separations are provided in the first two panels of Appendix A. 
  
LC/MS:    LC/MS  was  performed  using  a  pentafluorophenylpropyl  column  and  an  isocratic  mobile  phase  of  90  % 
acetonitrile and 10 % 100 mmol/L ammonium acetate in water (volume fractions).  Positive ion electrospray mass 
spectrometry was used for detection of the alkaloids.  The separation was monitored in the selected ion mode at m/z 
226  (terbutaline), m/z  136  (octopamine),  m/z  168  (synephrine),  m/z  138  (tyramine),  m/z 166 (hordenine), and m/z 
152 (N-methyltyramine).  A typical separation is provided in the third panel of Appendix A. 
 
LC/MS/M:  LC/MS/MS was performed using a pentafluorophenylpropyl column and an isocratic mobile phase of 
10  %  10  mmol/L  ammonium  acetate  in  water  and  90  %  10  mmol/L  ammonium  acetate  in  methanol  (volume 
fractions).  Multiple reaction monitoring was performed at the following transitions (m/z):  138 to 103 (tyramine), 
152 to 91 (N-methyltyramine) 154 to 91 (octopamine), 166 to 91 (hordenine), 168 to 135 (synephrine), and 226 to 
125 (terbutaline).  A typical separation is provided in the fourth panel of Appendix A. 
 
NIST Analyses for Toxic Elements:  SRM 3259 was screened for toxic elements (arsenic, cadmium, and lead) by 
using  inductively  coupled  plasma  mass  spectrometry  (ICP-MS)  following  microwave  digestion  using  nitric  and 
hydrofluoric acids.  Arsenic mass 75; cadmium masses 111, 112, and 114; indium (internal standard) mass 115; and 
lead masses 206, 207, and 208 were monitored.   
 
NIST  Analyses  for  Pesticides:    SRM  3259  was  screened  for  pesticide  residues  by  using  gas  chromatography 
(GC)/MS  following  Soxhlet  extraction  into  methylene  chloride;  a  2  g  sample  did  not  contain  quantifiable 
concentrations  of  hexachlorocyclohexanes  (HCHs),  chlordanes,  nonachlors,  dieldrin,  mirex,  heptachlors,  DDT,  or 
metabolites of DDT. 
 
Determination of Moisture:  Moisture content of SRM 3259 was determined at NIST (see “Instructions for Use”) 
by (1) freeze-drying to constant mass over 8 days; (2) drying over magnesium perchlorate in a desiccator at room 
temperature  for  28  days;  and  (3)  drying  for  2  hours  in  a  forced-air  oven  at  80  °C.    Unweighted  results  obtained 
using the mean of all three techniques were averaged to determine a conversion factor of (0.9848 ± 0.0111) gram 
dry mass per gram as-received mass, which was used to convert data from an as-received to a dry-mass basis; the 
uncertainty  shown on this value is an expanded uncertainty.  An uncertainty component for the conversion factor 
(0.26  %)  obtained  from  the  moisture  measurements   is  incorporated  in  the  uncertainties  of  the  certified  and 
reference values, reported on a dry-mass basis, that are provided in this certificate.

Homogeneity  Assessment:    The  homogeneity  of  citrus  alkaloids  was  assessed  at  NIST  by  using  the  methods 
described  above.    An  analysis  of  variance  did  not  show  inhomogeneity  for  the  0.05  g  and  0.5  g  test  portions 
analyzed.   
 
Value Assignment:  The equally weighted means from appropriate sets of data were used to calculate the assigned 
values.

(a) Each  certified  concentration  value,  expressed  as  a  mass  fraction,  is  an  equally  weighted  mean  of  results  provided  by  LC/UV, 
LC/FL, LC/MS, LC/MS/MS, NCTR, and ChromaDex for synephrine; LC/UV, LC/FL, LC/MS, LC/MS/MS, and ChromaDex for 
N-methyltyramine; and LC/FL, LC/MS, and LC/MS/MS for tyramine and total alkaloids  The uncertainty in the certified value, 
calculated  according  to  the  method  described  in  the  NIST  and  ISO  Guides  [2,3],  is  expressed  as  an  expanded  uncertainty,  U.  
The expanded uncertainty is calculated as U = kuc, where uc is intended to represent, at the level of one standard deviation, the 
combined  effect  of  between-laboratory,  within-laboratory,  and  drying  components  of  uncertainty.    The  coverage  factor  (k)  is 
determined  from  the  Student's  t  corresponding  to  the  appropriate  associated  degrees  of  freedom  and  approximately  95  % 
confidence for each analyte.
