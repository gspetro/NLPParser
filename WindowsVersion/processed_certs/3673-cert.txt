This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended for use in evaluating analytical methods for the determination of 
selected hydroxylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  (hydroxylated PAHs)  and phthalate ,  phenol, and volatile 
organic compound (VOC) metabolites in urine.  All of the constituents for which certified  and reference values are 
provided are naturally present in the urine.  A unit of SRM 3673 consists of five vials each containing 10 mL of frozen 
urine. 
 
The development of SRM  3673  was a collaboration between the National Institute of St
Technology (NIST) and the Division of Laboratory Sciences, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values:  Certified mass fraction values for hydroxylated PAHs are provided in Table 1.  A 
NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that all known or suspected 
sources of  uncertainty  have been investigated or taken into account
agreement of results obtained at NIST, CDC, and Institut national de santé publique du Québec (INSPQ).   
 
Reference Mass Fraction Values:  Reference mass fraction values are provided in Table 2 for phthalate metabolites, 
Table 3 for  phenol metabolites,  Table 4 for VOC metabolites,  and Table  5  for additional compounds .   Reference 
values are noncertified values that are estimates of the true values; however, the values do not meet the NIST criteria 
for certification and are provided with associated uncertainties that may reflect only measurement precision, may not 
include all sources of uncertainty, or may reflect a lack o f sufficient statistical agreement among multiple analyt ical 
methods [1]. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 3673 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until 31 May 2030, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given in this certificate 
(see “Instructions for Storage and Use”).

Acquisition of the material was performed  by K.E. Sharpless of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division.   Analytical 
measurements at NIST were performed by  B.A. Benner, Jr.,  and  S.S. Vander Pol   of the NIST  Chemical Sciences  
Division; and M.M. Schantz, Y. Vasquez, and M. Villegas formerly of NIST.  Analytical measurements at CDC were 
performed by K.U. Alwis, B.C. Blount, A. Calafat, Z. Li, and A. Sjödin and at INSPQ by E. Gaudreau. 
 
NOTICE AND WARNINGS TO USERS 
 
SRM 3673  IS INTENDED FOR  RESEARCH  USE.  THIS IS A HUMAN -SOURCE MATERIAL.    HANDLE 
PRODUCT AS A BIOHAZARDOUS MATERIAL CAPABLE OF TRANSMITTING INFEC TIOUS DISEASE.  
Accordingly, this human urine -based product should be handled at the Biosafety Level  2 or higher as recommended 
for any POTENTIALLY INFECTIOUS HUMAN SPECIMEN in the Cen
Prevention/National Institutes of Health Manual [2]. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE AND USE 
 
Storage:  The SRM is stored at  –80 °C at NIST.  The urine is shipp ed frozen (on dry ice) and, upon receipt, should 
be stored frozen until ready for use.  A freezer temperature of –20 °C is acceptable for storage for up to one week.  If 
a longer storage time is anticipated, the material should be stored at or below –60 °C.  The SRM should not be exposed 
to sunlight or ultraviolet radiation.  Storage of thawed  material at room or refrigerator temperatures may res ult in 
changes to analyte concentrations. 
 
Use:  Vials of the SRM to be analyzed should be removed from the freezer and thawed completely to room temperature 
(20 °C to  25 °C).  After the material is thawed to room temperature, it
should be vortex mixed before aliquots are withdrawn. 
 
SOURCE, PREPARATION, AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
This SRM was developed after an appropriate human subjects research determination by NIST. 
 
Sample Preparation:  Solomon Park Research Laboratories Inc.  acquired a  50 L pool of  non-smokers’ urine from 
donors who were not exposed to secondhand cigarette smoke.  The urine was filtered prior to aliquotting into amber 
glass bottles that are capable of withstanding ultra-cold temperatures.  Each bottle was filled with 10 mL of urine and 
stored at –80 °C prior to shipping on dry ice to NIST. 
 
Hydroxylated Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons:  The approach used for the value assignment of hydroxylated 
PAHs in SRM  3673 consisted of combining results from analyses of the material at NIST,
 CDC, and INSPQ.  At 
NIST, duplicate test portions of approximately 3 g from 10 vials were gravimetrically transferred to centrifuge tubes, 
-naphthol-d7  and 3 -HO-phenanthrene  13C6, 
spiked with a known amount of internal standard solution containing 1
followed by the addition of sodium acetate and β-glucuronidase/aryl sulfatase enzyme.  The samples were incubated 
at 37  °C for 18  h and then eluted through a Strata
 X (Phenomenex, Torrance,  CA) solid -phase extraction  (SPE) 
column.  Following washing and elution, th e samples were concentrated to 0.5  mL in toluene  and transferred to an 
autosampler vial.  MSTFA ( N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide) was added,  and samples were heated at 
60 °C for 30  min  to produce the trimethylsilyl derivatives of the hydroxylated PAHs.  The de
rivatives were then 
analyzed using gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC/MS) with a 0.25 mm i.d. × 60 m fused silica capillary 
column with a 5 % (mole fraction) phenyl methylpolysiloxane phase (0.25 μm film thickness; DB-5, Agilent Technologies, 
Wilmington, DE). 
 
The methods used for measurement of the hydroxylated PAHs at CDC ar e described in Li  et al. [3].  At INSPQ, the 
urinary metabolites were hydrolyzed with β-glucuronidase enzyme followed by extraction with hexane at neutral pH.  
These extracts were then evaporated, derivatized with MSTFA, and analyzed u sing GC coupled with tandem mass 
spectrometry (GC/MS/MS).  The multiple reaction monitoring mode was used to quantify the hydroxylated PAHs. 
 
Homogeneity Assessment for  Hydroxylated  PAHs:   The homogeneity of SRM  3673  was assessed by analyzing 
duplicate test portions of 3 g from 10 vials selected by stratified random sampling.  Test portions were processed and 
analyzed as described above for 
the NIST method.    No  statistically significant  differences were observed for the 
hydroxylated PAHs at the  3 g test portion size, suggesting that SRM  3673 is homogenous at that sample size (and 
larger).

Phthalate, Phenol, and Volatile Organic Compound Metabolites: The methods used at CDC for the quantification 
of phthalate and phenol metabolites are described in Silva et al . [4] and Ye et al . [5], respectively.  Bisphenol A was 
quantified at NIST using a  method adapted from Arakawa et al.  [6].  Test portions of approximately 1  g were taken 
from six vials of SRM  3673.  An internal standard solution containing  13C12-bisphenol A was added followed by the 
addition of β-glucuronidase enzyme.  Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 120 min.  An amino SPE column was used 
to remove some of the potential interferences.  MSTFA with 1  % (volume fraction) TMCS (trimethylchlorosilane) 
was added to the concentrated sample followed by incubation at 60
0.25 mm i.d. × 30 m fused silica capillary column with a 5  % (mole fraction) phenyl methylpolysiloxane phase (0.25  μm 
film thickness; HP-5MS).  The method used at the CDC for the quantification of VOC metabolites is described in Alwis et 
al. [7]. 
 
Additional Analytes:  Creatinine was quantified at NIST using liquid chromatography with mass  spectrometry (LC/MS).  
Samples of the thawed urine were spiked with d3-creatinine followed by the addition of water and a hydrochloric acid (HCl) 
solution to bring the final concentration to 0.01
 column, 
0.25 cm × 4.6 mm, 5 µm particle (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) with single-ion monitoring.   
 
The free (non-conjugated) levels of nicotine, ib uprofen, caffeine, cotinine, and theobromine in SRM  3673 were measured 
at NIST using liquid/liquid extraction with chloroform followed by GC/MS analysis s
imilar to that described in Man et 
al. [8].   Isotopically l abeled nicotine, ibuprofen, caffeine, cotin ine, hydroxycotinine, and theobromine were used as the 
internal standards.  The GC/MS analysis used a 
fraction) trifluoropropyl methylpolysiloxane phase (0.25 μm film thickness; DB-210). 
 
Metrological Traceability:    Certified values are metrologically traceable to the SI  derived  unit  for mass  fraction 
(expressed as micrograms per kilogram) and the measurand is the total concentration of each analyte in Table 1.  For 
reference values, the measurands are the mass fraction as determined by the method indicated for each analyte listed 
in Tables 2 -5, and are metrological traceable to the SI  derived unit for mass fraction, expressed as micrograms per 
kilogram or milligrams per kilogram.
