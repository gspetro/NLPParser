Certificate of Analysis 
 
Standard Reference Material 1932 
 
Fluorescein Solution 
 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended for use in establishing a reference scale for fluorescence intensity 
based  upon  Molecules  of  Equivalent  Soluble  Fluorophore (MESF)  units [1–3].    This  SRM  is  certified  for  the 
concentration of fluorescein with a certified purity in a borate buffer solution.  The MESF scale is established for a 
particular set of experimental conditions by measuring the fluorescence intensity of known amounts of this SRM under 
a specific set of conditions (see “Instructions for Use”).  A unit of SRM 1932 consists of three flamed sealed amber 
glass ampoules, each containing approximately 2.0 mL of fluorescein in an aqueous borate buffer. 
 
Certified  Value:   The  certified  concentration  of  fluorescein  given  below  is  based  on  gravimetric  preparation  and 
analysis of purity by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy that was independently verified by analysis of 
impurities.  A summary of fluorescein purity determinations is provided in Table 2.  A NIST certified value is a value 
for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been 
investigated  or  taken  into  account [4].    The  measurands  are  the  concentration  and  purity  of  fluorescein  and  the 
traceability  is  to  the  SI  derived  units  for  amount-of-substance  concentration  and  mass  fraction,  expressed  as 
micromoles per kilogram and percent, respectively.

Reference Values:  Table 1 gives reference values for the molar absorption coefficient of SRM 1932 corrected for 
purity and fluorescence bias.  NIST reference values are noncertified values which represent the best estimate of the 
true values based on available data; however, the values do not meet the NIST criteria for certification [4] and are 
provided with associated uncertainties that may reflect only measurement precision, may not include all sources of 
uncertainty,  or  may  reflect  a  lack  of  sufficient  statistical  agreement  among  multiple  analytical  methods.    The 
measurands are the molar absorption coefficients as listed in Table 1 as realized by the methods used.  Metrological 
traceability is to the SI derived units for molar absorptivity, expressed as kilograms per mole centimeter.

Information Values:  Table 3 gives information values for SRM 1932.  A NIST information value is a value that may 
be of use to the SRM user, but insufficient information is available to assess adequately the uncertainty associated 
with the value.  Information values cannot be used to establish metrological traceability.

Preparation of the SRM:  The borate buffer solution was prepared by dissolving 18.56 g of boric acid granules in 
slightly less than 3 L of water.  The pH was adjusted to above 9.1 using 40 mL of an approximately 3.0 mol∙L-1 NaOH 
solution made by dissolving 29.87 g of sodium hydroxide pellets in 0.250 L of water.  The mixture was diluted to 
3.00 L with water to give a borate buffer with a boric acid concentration of about 0.10 mol∙L-1. 
 
The SRM solution was prepared in a darkened room by dissolving 0.05636 g ± 0.00004 g of fluorescein (buoyancy 
corrected) in 2.7134 kg ± 0.0006 kg of borate buffer solution (buoyancy corrected).  The mass of fluorescein used was 
corrected 
of 
yielding 
60.97 μmol∙kg-1 ± 0.40 μmol∙kg-1.    The  fluorescein  solution  contained  in  an  amber  bottle  was  immediately 
aliquotted  into  ampoules  that  were  subsequently  flame-sealed.    The  pH  and  mass  density  of  the  SRM  were 
determined from measurements on four ampoules selected randomly from the lot.  
 
Assignment of Uncertainties:  Standard uncertainty components equivalent to the estimated standard deviation were 
assigned for sample inhomogeneity and measurement uncertainties.  These values were then combined with balance 
accuracy and estimated instrument method uncertainties using the root-sum-of-squares method.  An expansion factor 
of k = 2 was applied so that the expanded uncertainties given in this certificate express an interval within which the 
true value is expected to fall with a level of confidence of approximately 95 % for a normal distribution [5]. 
 
SRM  Stability:    NIST  monitored  the  stability  of  a  prototype  fluorescein  solution  similar  to  SRM 1932  for  over 
24 months.  Within the error of the measurements, the absorbance spectrum and the fluorescence spectral radiance (as 
indicated by the fluorescence signal spectrum) of the prototype solution did not change.  Therefore, SRM 1932, if 
stored  in  the  dark  between  2 °C  to  6 °C,  is  likely  to  maintain  its  original  optical  properties  for  the  duration  of  its 
certification period.  NIST will validate this conclusion by periodic monitoring of the stability over the lifetime of the 
SRM (see “Maintenance of SRM Certification”). 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 
 
CAUTION:  This SRM is a solution contained in tip-sealed glass ampoules with pre-scored stems.  Therefore, all 
appropriate  safety  precautions,  including  the  use  of  gloves  during  handling,  should  be  taken  to  avoid  accidental 
breakage or spillage.  Unopened ampoules should be stored in the dark between 2 °C to 6 °C in an upright position.  
The ampoules should NOT be frozen because of the possibility of breakage during freezing and thawing.  Once the 
ampoule is opened, the solution should be used promptly with minimal exposure to any light (exposure to incandescent 
lighting  is  preferable  to  illumination  from  daylight  or  fluorescent  lighting).    Any  unused  solution  in  the  ampoule 
should be discarded in accordance with all applicable Federal, State and Local regulations. 
 
Opening  an  Ampoule:    When  an  ampoule  is  opened,  that  area  of  the  stem  where  the  pre-scored  band  is  located 
(around the gold band) should be wiped with a clean, damp cloth and the body of the ampoule wrapped in absorbent 
material.  Then holding the ampoule steady and with the thumb and forefinger grasping the stem above the gold band, 
minimal thumb pressure should be applied to the stem to snap it.  Correctly done, the stem should break easily where 
pre-scored.  The use of a metal file to break the stem is NOT recommended. 
 
The  SRM 1932  solution  should  always  be  diluted  gravimetrically  at  least  one-hundred  fold  with  the  same  buffer 
system  used  for  the  analyte  of  interest.    Subsequent  gravimetric  dilutions  can  then  be  employed  to  generate  a 
calibration curve.  The calibration curve describes the relationship between fluorescence intensity, as determined by 
the fluorometer and the concentration of fluorescein, as determined by the gravimetric dilution.  Care must be taken 
in  making the gravimetric dilutions because uncertainties expand during this serial process.  An error at one level 
adversely affects determinations at all subsequent levels.  The calibration curve measurements should be generated 
starting with the lowest concentration.  For best results, the conditions used for determining the calibration curve such 
as solution degassing, temperature, ionic strength, pH, etc., should closely match those used in the measurement of 
the analyte.  Because fluorescence is a highly sensitive technique, great attention must be paid to the cleanliness of 
glassware and any other apparatus that contacts the solutions.  Many plastics and gloves can contaminate samples with 
small amounts of highly fluorescent materials such as release agents and plasticizers.  The running of blanks to check 
for such contamination is highly recommended.

Depending on the solution pH, aqueous fluorescein solutions are complex, rapidly equilibrating mixtures of its several 
forms  (cation,  neutral  species,  monoanion,  and  dianion).    Each  species  has  unique  absorbance  and  fluorescence 
spectra.  Above pH 9, aqueous fluorescein exists almost exclusively as the highly fluorescent dianion.  However, as 
the pH of the solution is reduced, the concentration of the dianion decreases, and the concentrations of the much less 
fluorescent  monoanion  and  neutral  forms  increase [6].    Accordingly,  the  sensitivity  of  the  fluorometric  assay  for 
fluorescein also decreases, and quantitation becomes very dependent on knowing or maintaining the precise pH of the 
solutions during calibration as well during the assay itself.  While the calibration strategy described above can work 
with  solutions  below  pH 9,  the  uncertainties  of  such  measurements  inevitably  grow  larger  as  the  solution  pH  is 
lowered.
