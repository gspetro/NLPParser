Standard Reference Material® 3241 

 
Ephedra sinica Stapf Native Extract 

 
Standard  Reference  Material  (SRM)  3241  is  intended  primarily  for  use  in  validating  analytical  methods  for  the 
determination of ephedrine alkaloids and toxic elements in Ephedra sinica extracts and similar matrices.  This SRM 
can also be used for quality assurance when assigning values to in-house control materials.  SRM 3241 is part of a 
suite  of  ephedra  dietary  supplement  SRMs  that  have  been  developed  to  cover  a  range  of  natural  matrices  and 
ephedrine  alkaloid  levels.    A  unit  of  SRM  3241  consists  of  ten  bottles  of  extract,  each  containing  approximately 
1.2 g of material. 
 
Certified Concentration Values:  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in 
its accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or accounted for [1].  The certified 
concentration  values  of  selected  ephedrine  alkaloids  and  elements  are  provided  in  Tables 1 and 2.    Values  were 
derived from the combination of results provided by NIST and collaborating laboratories.  The certified values in 
this material are the equally weighted means of the individual sets of NIST results and the means of the individual 
sets of measurements made by collaborating laboratories; the associated uncertainties are expanded uncertainties at the 
95 % level of confidence [2,3].  Values are reported on a dry-mass basis in mass fraction units [4].  
 
value  that  is  the  best  estimate  of  the 
Reference Concentration Values:  A NIST reference value is a noncertified value that is the best estimate of the 
true value based on available data; however, the value does not meet the NIST criteria for certification [1] and is 
provided  with  associated  uncertainties  that  may  reflect  only  measurement  reproducibility,  may  not  include  all 
sources of uncertainty, or may reflect a lack of sufficient statistical agreement among multiple analytical methods.  
Reference concentration values for additional ephedrine alkaloids and elements are provided in Tables 3 and 4.   
 
Expiration  of Value Assignment:   The  value  assignment  of  this  SRM  is  valid  until  31  March  2014,  within  the 
istructions
measurement uncertainties specified, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions 
given in this certificate.  Value assignment is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, or modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Value Assignment:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its value assignment. If 
substantive technical changes occur that affect the value assignment before the expiration of this certificate, NIST 
will notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
The  development  of  SRM  3241  was  a  collaboration  among  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology 
(NIST);  the  National  Institutes  of  Health  (NIH),  Office  of  Dietary  Supplements  (ODS);  and  the  Food  and  Drug 
Administration  (FDA),  Center  for  Food  Safety  and  Applied  Nutrition  (CFSAN)  and  FDA,  Center  for  Drug 
Evaluation and Research (CDER). 
 
The  coordination  of  the  technical  measurements  leading  to  the  certification  of  this  SRM  was  performed  by 
L.C. Sander, K.E. Sharpless, and S.A. Wise of the NIST Analytical Chemistry Division. 
 
Acquisition and preparation of the material were coordinated by A. NguyenPho of FDA CDER and K.E. Sharpless 
of the NIST Analytical Chemistry Division.

NOTICE AND WARNING TO USERS 

Storage:  The material should be stored at controlled room temperature (20 °C to 25 °C) in its unopened bottle until 
required for use. 
 
WARNING:  FOR LABORATORY USE ONLY.  NOT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 

Prior to removal of a test portion for analysis, the contents of a bottle of material should be mixed thoroughly.  The 
concentrations of constituents in SRM 3241 are reported on a dry-mass basis.  A separate subsample of the SRM 
should  be  removed  from  its  bottle  at  the  time  of  analysis  and  dried  to  determine  the  concentration  based  on  dry 
mass.    (See  “NIST  Determination  of  Moisture,”  below,  for  drying  conditions.)    Test  portions  used  for  NIST 
analyses, described below, were 0.3 g for ephedrine alkaloids, 0.2 g for arsenic and mercury, and 1 g for cadmium 
and lead.   
 
Note 1:  Samples of the extract were originally packaged as a powder; however, over time the extract may become a 
single  solid  pellet  or  several  solid  pieces.    For  hardened  samples,  an  appropriate  portion  should  be  removed  and 
subdivided  using  a  knife.   The  certified  and  reference  values  for  composition  provided  in Tables  1  through  4  are 
valid independent of the sample consistency. 
 
Note 2:  In  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  Title  21 Code of Federal Regulations,  Sections 1309 and 1310 
(21 CFR 1309  and  1310),  NIST  is  registered  with  the  U.S.  Drug  Enforcement  Agency  (DEA)  to  distribute  
this  material,  which  is  classified  as  a  List 1  chemical.    Analytical  laboratories  are  not  required  to  register  
with  the  DEA  to  purchase  and  handle  this  material  (21 CFR 1309.21).

biomass was extracted with hot water under pressure in China, and the resulting extract was used in the production 
of the “native extract” (SRM 3241) and the “commercial extract” (SRM 3242).  A portion of the water extract was 
filtered, concentrated, and spray-dried to produce the native extract.  Approximately 15 kg of this native extract was 
shipped to NIST.  The native extract was subsequently transferred to ChromaDex, Inc. (Santa Ana, CA), where it 
was blended and bottled under nitrogen in amber high-density, polyethylene bottles with polypropylene screw caps.  
After bottling, the material was irradiated by 60Co to an absorbed dose of 12.8 kGy to 15.4 kGy. 
 
Analytical Approach for Determination of Ephedrine Alkaloids 

Value assignment of the concentrations of the ephedrine alkaloids in SRM 3241 was based on the combination of 
measurements  from  different  analytical  methods  at  NIST  and  at  three  collaborating  laboratories.    A  total  of  eight 
sets  of  measurements  were  used  for  the  value  assignment  of  the  concentrations  of  ephedrine  alkaloids.    NIST 
provided  measurements  by  using  a  combination  of  two  sample  extraction  procedures  and  three  liquid 
chromatography  (LC)  methods  with  different  detection,  i.e.,  ultraviolet  absorbance  spectrometry  (UV),  mass 
spectrometry (MS), tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), and a capillary electrophoresis (CE) method as described 
below.    Results  for  ephedrine  alkaloids  were  provided  by  three  collaborating  laboratories:    National  Research 
Council Canada (NRCC), FDA, and ChromaDex.  NRCC provided results from two analytical methods:  LC/UV 
and LC/MS/MS.  FDA results were based on LC/MS/MS [5], and ChromaDex results were based on LC/UV [6].  
Two collaborating laboratories analyzed a minimum of six subsamples (one from each of six bottles or two from 
each  of  three  bottles);  one  laboratory  analyzed  one  subsample  from  three  bottles  of  SRM  3241.    The  analytical 
methods for NIST and the collaborating laboratories are described in detail in reference 7. 
 
NIST Analyses for Ephedrine Alkaloids 

Ephedrine alkaloids were measured by using combinations of two sample preparation methods, three LC methods, 
and one CE method as described below and in detail in reference 7.  Four independently prepared calibrants were 
used for each of the methods.  Calibrants were prepared gravimetrically, at levels intended to approximate the levels 
of  the  alkaloids  in  the  extracts  of  the  SRM.   A  single  internal  standard  solution  was  used  for  the  calibrants  and 
samples.  Calculations are based on average response factors for the calibrants (typically duplicate analysis of four 
calibrant solutions, n = 8). 
 
Sonication Extraction:  Six 0.3 g portions of the SRM were placed in 50 mL polyethylene centrifuge tubes or glass 
pressurized-fluid  extraction  tubes,  followed  by  the  addition  of  a  measured  mass  of  internal  standard  solution.  
Approximately  30 g  of  methanol  was  added  to  the  tubes,  and  the  tubes  were  capped.    The  solid  matter  was 
suspended  by  shaking,  and  the  tubes  were  placed  in  an  ultrasonic  bath  for  90 min.    At  the  completion  of  the 
sonication extraction, the samples were centrifuged or allowed to settle, and an aliquot of the supernatant solution 
was passed through a 0.45 μm × 2.5 cm syringe filter.  Samples prepared by this approach were analyzed by LC/UV 
or LC/MS/MS. 
 
Soxhlet  Extraction:    Ten  0.3 g  portions  of  the  SRM  were  weighed  into  glass-fritted  Soxhlet  thimbles,  each 
containing  approximately  a  1 cm  layer  of  diatomaceous  earth  (Hydromatrix,  Isco  Corp.,  Lincoln,  NE).    After 
stirring the sample, additional diatomaceous earth was added (approximately 1 cm).  A measured mass of internal 
standard  solution  (ephedrine-d3)  was  transferred  to  the  Soxhlet  thimble.    The  samples  were  extracted  with 
approximately 200 mL methanol for at least 18 h.  Extracts were concentrated, passed through a 0.45 μm × 2.5 cm 
syringe filter, and analyzed.  Samples prepared by this approach were analyzed by LC/MS. 
 
LC with UV Absorbance Detection (LC/UV):  An isocratic LC method with a methanol/phosphate buffer mobile 
phase  was  utilized  for  LC/UV  determination  of  the  alkaloids,  similar  to  the  method  of  Roman [6].    A 
250 mm × 4.6 mm  alkylphenyl  bonded  phase  column  (Synergy  Polar  RP,  Phenomenex,  Torrance,  CA)  was  used 
with  a  precolumn  and  an  in-line  filter.    Column  temperature  was  controlled  at  29.0 °C ± 0.5 °C  with  a 
circulating-fluid  column  jacket  and  water  bath.  The  mobile  phase  flow  rate  was  set  at  1.5 mL/min,  and  detection 
was  at  208 nm.    Terbutaline  was  used  as  the internal standard for LC/UV measurements.  A typical separation is 
provided in Appendix A. 
 
LC  with  Mass  Spectrometric  Detection  (LC/MS):    A  250 mm × 4.6 mm  phenyl  bonded  phase  column 
(YMC Phenyl, Waters, Inc., Milford, MA) was used at ambient temperature (21 °C ± 1 °C) with an isocratic mobile 
phase  (water/methanol/acetic acid/ammonium  acetate)  at  1.0 mL/min.    The  mass  spectrometer  was  operated  in 
positive  ion,  atmospheric  pressure  ionization,  electrospray  mode  (API-ES).  Quantitation  of  the  six  alkaloids  was 
(m/z)  at  134 (norephedrine  and  norpseudoephedrine),  148 (ephedrine  and 
based  on  monitoring 
pseudoephedrine), 180 (methylephedrine and methylpseudoephedrine), and 169 (ephedrine-d3).  Ephedrine-d3 was 
used as the internal standard for LC/MS measurements.  A typical separation is provided in Appendix A.

LC  with  Tandem  Mass  Spectrometric  Detection  (LC/MS/MS):    Chromatographic  conditions  were  similar  to 
those used in the LC/MS method; however, the flow rate was reduced to 0.5 mL/min and column temperature was 
set at 30 °C ± 2 °C.  A program was designed to measure each individual analyte using multiple reaction monitoring 
(MRM).    The  protonated  precursor  of  each  analyte  was  selected  in  the  first  quadrupole,  these  ions  collisionally 
dissociated in the collision cell (the second quadrupole), and the predetermined fragment ions monitored in the third 
quadrupole.  The following precursor and fragment ions (m/z) were monitored:  151.8 and 134.0 (norephedrine and 
norpseudoephedrine),  165.9  and  148.0  (ephedrine  and  pseudoephedrine),  179.9  and  162.0  (methylephedrine  and 
methylpseudoephedrine), and 168.9 and 151.0 (ephedrine-d3).  Ephedrine-d3 was used as the internal standard for 
LC/MS/MS measurements. A typical separation is provided in Appendix A. 
 
Capillary Electrophoresis (CE):  Portions (0.25 g) of the SRM were weighed into polyethylene centrifuge tubes, 
followed by the addition of a measured mass of internal standard solution (β-phenylethylamine hydrochloride) and 
approximately 18 mL of methanol.  The samples were placed in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min, and the supernatant 
solution  was  passed  through  0.2 μm  nylon  syringe  filters.    Electrophoretic  measurements  were  performed  on  a 
CE system  with  a  photodiode  array  detector  (data  collected  at  210 nm)  with  a  high-sensitivity  UV  detection  cell.  
Three chiral CE methods (utilizing different cyclodextrin-based chiral selectors) were used to analyze the samples.  
The methods were sufficiently independent to provide slightly different selectivity, thereby reducing the likelihood 
of  undetected  peak  overlap  and  providing  additional  confidence  in  the  enantiomeric  identity  of  the  analytes.  
Separations  were  performed  in  unmodified  fused  silica  capillaries  maintained  at  25 °C,  and  injections  were 
performed  by  pressure.    Applied  voltages  were  in  the  range  of  15 kV  to  30 kV.    A  detailed  discussion  of  the 
CE method  is  provided  in  reference 8.    A  typical  separation  is  provided  in  Appendix A;  note  that  only  the  
(–)-ephedrine  and  (+)-pseudoephedrine  enantiomers  that  are  naturally  occurring  in  E. sinica  were  found  in  this 
material, indicating that the material was not altered through the addition of synthetic alkaloids.  
 
Analytical Approach for Determination of Elements 

The elements of primary interest for SRM 3241 were the potentially toxic contaminants arsenic, cadmium, lead, and 
mercury.  Value assignment of the concentrations of toxic elements in SRM 3241 was based on the combination of 
measurements  at  NIST  using  a  single  analytical  method  and  results  from  one  or  two  collaborating  laboratories 
(NRCC  and  FDA).  At NIST, instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) was used for the determination of 
arsenic, isotope dilution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ID ICP-MS) was used for determination of 
cadmium  and  lead,  and  cold  vapor  (CV)  ID  ICP-MS  was  used  for  determination  of  mercury.    For  all  NIST 
measurements, botanical-matrix SRMs with certified values for the elements of interest were analyzed concurrently 
as  control  samples.    NRCC  used  ID  ICP-MS  for  the  determination  of  cadmium  and  lead  and  hydride  generation 
graphite  furnace  atomic  absorption  spectrometry  (HG  GFAAS)  for  the  determination  of  arsenic.    FDA  provided 
results for cadmium, lead, and mercury using ICP-MS.  FDA also provided results using prompt gamma activation 
analysis  (PGAA)  for  additional  elements  including  boron,  calcium,  carbon,  chlorine,  hydrogen,  iron,  magnesium, 
nitrogen,  potassium,  silicon,  sodium,  and  sulfur  [9].    All  collaborating  laboratories  analyzed  a  minimum  of  six 
subsamples (one from each of six bottles or two from each of three bottles) of SRM 3241. 
 
NIST Analyses for Elements 

Arsenic  was  measured  by  using  instrumental  neutron  activation  analysis  (INAA).    Individual  disks  were  formed 
from 200 mg test portions of the SRM using a stainless steel die and hydraulic press.  Standards were prepared by 
transferring a weighed portion of a solution containing a known amount of arsenic onto filter papers.  Disks were 
formed  from  the  dried  filter  papers.    Samples,  standards,  and  controls  were  packaged  individually  in  clean 
polyethylene bags, placed together in a polyethylene irradiation container, and exposed to a neutron fluence rate of 
1 × 1014 cm-2 ⋅s-1 for a total of 2 h.  Decay times were approximately 5 d to 7 d.  Gamma rays were collected using an 
intrinsic  germanium  detector  with  a  relative  efficiency  of  35 %  and  a  resolution  of  1.75 keV  (full-width  at  half 
maximum peak height for the 1333-keV line from  60Co).  Quantification was based on comparison with standards 
using the 559-keV line from 76As. 
 
For cadmium and lead determinations, the total contents (approximately 1.2 g) were taken from each of six bottles 
of the SRM.  Isotopically enriched 111Cd and 206Pb were added to the samples prior to digestion in Teflon beakers by 
wet  ashing  with  nitric acid,  hydrofluoric acid,  and  hydrogen peroxide  at  185 °C  for  60 h.    The  residue  was 
redissolved in 2 % nitric acid, and measurements were made by using ID ICP-MS [10]. 

SRM 3241 

Page 4 of 10 

 
For mercury determinations, a single 0.25 g portion was taken from each of six bottles of the SRM.  Isotopically 
enriched  201Hg  was  added  to  the  samples  prior  to  digestion  in  quartz  vessels  with  nitric  acid  in  a  high-pressure 
microwave  system.    Following  digestion,  samples  were  diluted  to  contain  an  approximate  201Hg concentration  of 
0.05 ng/g.    Samples  were  allowed  to  degas  overnight  at  4 °C.    Measurements  were  made  by  using  cold-vapor 
mercury generation (using tin [II] chloride reductant) coupled with ID ICP-MS [11]. 
 
NIST Determination of Moisture 

Moisture content of SRM 3241 was determined by (1) freeze-drying to constant mass over 11 days, (2) drying over 
magnesium perchlorate in a desiccator at room temperature for 17 days, and (3) drying in a forced-air oven at 85 °C 
for 4 h.  Unweighted results obtained using all three techniques were averaged to determine a conversion factor of 
0.9570 gram dry mass per gram as-received mass, which was used to convert NIST data from an as-received to a 
dry-mass  basis.    Collaborating  laboratories  converted  their  data  to  a  dry-mass  basis  using  their  own  moisture 
determinations.    A  variability-in-moisture  component  is  included  in  the  uncertainties  of  both  the  certified  and 
reference values, reported on a dry-mass basis, that are provided in this certificate. 
 
Homogeneity Assessment 

The homogeneity of ephedrine in this material was assessed at NIST by using the LC/UV method described above.  
An analysis of variance did not show inhomogeneity for a 0.3 g sample.  Other measurands were treated as though 
they were homogeneously distributed, although homogeneity was not assessed. 
 
Value Assignment 

The equally weighted means from each set of data were used to calculate the assigned values.  In cases where NIST 
made measurements, the NIST means were averaged with the individual data set means provided by collaborating 
laboratories to obtain the assigned value.  In cases where NIST did not make measurements, the mean of the data set 
means became the assigned value.

standard deviation, the combined effect of between-laboratory, within-laboratory, and drying components of uncertainty.  The 
coverage  factor, k,  is  determined  from  the  Student's  t-distribution  corresponding  to  the  appropriate  associated  degrees  of 
freedom and approximately 95 % confidence for each analyte.

(a) Each reference concentration value, expressed as a mass fraction on a dry-mass basis, is the equally weighted mean of values 
provided  by  one  collaborating  laboratory.    The  uncertainty  in  the  reference  value,  calculated  according  to  the  method 
described  in  the  ISO  Guide  [2,3],  is  expressed  as  an  expanded  uncertainty,  U.    The  expanded  uncertainty  is  calculated  as 
U = kuc, where uc is intended to represent, at the level of one standard deviation, the combined effect of within-laboratory and 
drying components of uncertainty.  The coverage factor, k, is determined from the Student's t-distribution corresponding to the 
appropriate associated degrees of freedom and approximately 95 % confidence for each analyte.
