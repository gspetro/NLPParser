Certificate of Analysis 
Standard Reference Material 2780 

 

 

Hard Rock Mine Waste 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended for use in the evaluation of methods and for the calibration of 
apparatuses used to determine heavy metals and other elements in hard rock mine waste and materials of a similar 
matrix.    SRM 2780  is  composed  of  material  collected  from  a  waste  pile  of  an  abandoned  mine  site  near 
Silverton, CO.    A  unit  of  SRM 2780  consists  of  approximately  50 g  of  material  of  which  90 %  passes  a  150 µm 
(No. 100) sieve. 
 
Certified  Mass  Fraction  Values:    Certified  mass  fraction  values  for  12 elements  are  listed  in  Table 1.    A  NIST 
certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that all known or suspected 
sources  of  bias  have  been  investigated  or  taken  into  account.    All  values  are  reported  as  mass  fractions [1],  on  a 
dry-mass  basis  (see  “Instructions  for  Drying”),  and  are  based  on  measurements  using  a  sample  mass  of  at  least 
250 mg. 
 
Reference Mass Fraction Values:  Reference mass fraction values for seven elements are provided in Table 2.  A 
NIST  reference  value  is  a  noncertified  value  that  is  the  best  estimate  of  the  true  value  based  on  available  data; 
however, the value does not meet the NIST criteria for certification and is provided with associated uncertainties that 
may reflect only measurement reproducibility, may not include all sources of uncertainty, or may reflect a lack of 
sufficient statistical agreement among multiple analytical methods.  Mass fraction values are on a dry-mass basis. 
 
Information Mass Fraction Values:  Information mass fraction values for 28 elements are provided in Table 3.  An 
information value is a value that may be of use to the SRM user, but insufficient information is available to assess 
adequately the uncertainty associated with the value. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 2780 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until  31 December 2014,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  instructions  given  in  this 
certificate  (see  “Instructions  for  Use”).    This  certification  is  nullified  if  the  SRM  is  damaged,  contaminated,  or 
otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance  of  SRM  Certification:    NIST  will  monitor  this  SRM  over  the  period  of  its  certification.    If 
substantive  technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will 
notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
The overall direction and coordination of the technical measurements leading to the certification of this SRM were 
performed by G.C. Turk of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division. 
 
Analytical  measurements  at  NIST  were  performed  by  C.M. Beck II,  W.R. Kelly,  S.E. Long,  J.L. Mann, 
A.F. Marlow, J.R. Sieber, R.D. Vocke, Jr., and L.L. Yu of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division. 
 
Statistical consultation was provided by S.D. Leigh and D.D. Leber of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division. 
 
Mine waste sample collection, preparation of the SRM, and contributing chemical analyses were performed by the 
U.S. Geological  Survey (USGS)  under  the  direction  of  S.A. Wilson.    Details  are  described [3]  in  USGS  
Open-File  Report 99-370  and  is  available  by  contacting  the  USGS  Earth  Science  Information  Center:    telephone 
(303) 202-4210; or e-mail infoservices@usgs.gov.

Partial  financial  support  for  the  development  of  this  SRM  was  provided  by  the  U.S.  Environmental  Protection 
Agency (EPA)  under  the  direction  of  project  manager  B.A. Schumacher  of  the  EPA  National  Exposure  Research 
Laboratory, Characterization Research Division, Las Vegas, NV. 
 
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Office  of  Reference 
Materials. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 
 
To  relate  analytical  determinations  to  the  certified  values  on  this  certificate,  a  minimum  sample  mass  of  250 mg 
should be used.  Sampling and sample preparation procedures should be designed to avoid material segregation on 
the basis of particle size.  It is recommended to mix the contents of the bottle prior to sampling by turning the bottle 
end over end for two minutes.  The sample should be dried accordingly (see “Instructions for Drying”).  If particle 
size reduction is performed, it is the user’s responsibility to prevent contamination or loss of material.  This SRM 
must be stored in an air-conditioned or similar cool and dry environment away from light and fumes. 
 
Instructions  for  Drying:    Analyses  should  be  performed  on  samples  as  received;  separate  samples  should  be 
weighed  before  and  after  drying  to  obtain  a  correction  factor  for  moisture.    Samples  may  be  dried  in  an  oven  at 
107 ºC under clean, dry inert gas, or in a desiccator over fresh anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, or by other equivalent method 
which reaches a constant dry weight.

The certified values for mercury and sulfur are the means of results obtained by NIST using isotope dilution mass 
spectrometry.  The expanded uncertainty is calculated as U = kuc, where uc is intended to represent, at the level of 
one standard deviation, the combined standard uncertainty calculated according to the ISO Guide [1].  The coverage 
factor,  k,  is  determined  from  the  Student’s  t-distribution  for  the  appropriate  degrees  of  freedom  to  yield  95 % 
confidence.    The  certified  values  for  the  remaining  elements  are  derived  from  the  results  of  at  least  one  analysis 
performed at NIST and independent results from one or more methods provided by the USGS using the approach for 
combining  results  for  multiple  methods [2].    Multiple  method  results  from  USGS  were  first  combined  to  give  a 
single  value  and  uncertainty  before  being  combined  with  the  NIST  results.    The  certified  value  is  an  unweighted 
mean of the results from NIST and USGS.  The uncertainty listed with each value is an expanded uncertainty about 
the mean, U = kuc, with a coverage factor, k, determined from the Student’s t-distribution for the appropriate degrees 
of  freedom  to  yield  95 %  confidence.    Each  uc  is  calculated  by  combining  a  between-method  variance [2]  with  a 
pooled, within-method variance following the ISO Guide [1].  Analytical methods are listed in Table 4.

The reference values are based on the results of a single NIST method and one or more USGS methods.  Reference 
values  were  derived  from  multiple  results  in  the  same  manner  as  was  done  for  the  certified  values.    Analytical 
methods are listed in Table 4.
