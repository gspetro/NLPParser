Standard Reference Material 3290 
 
Dry Cat Food 

 
etermining 
This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  use  in  validating  methods  for  determining 
proximates, fatty acids, vitamins, elements, and amino acids in dry cat food and similar matrices.  This SRM can also 
be  used  for  quality  assurance  when  assigning  values  to  in-house  control  materials.    This  SRM  is  a  blend  of 
commercially available dry cat foods.  A unit of SRM 3290 consists of five heat-sealed, aluminized pouches, each 
containing approximately 10 g of material. 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values:  The certified mass fraction values of fatty acids, elements, and vitamins, reported 
on a dry-mass basis, are provided in Tables 1 through 3.  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the 
highest confidence in its accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into 
account [1].  Analyses for value assignment were performed by NIST and collaborating laboratories.  Certified values 
were calculated as the mean of the mean values from NIST methods and the median of the mean of results provided 
by  collaborating  laboratories,  where  appropriate.    All  values  were  combined  without  weighting.    The  associated 
uncertainties are expressed at an approximately 95 % level of confidence [2–4]. 
 
Reference Mass Fraction Values:  Reference mass fraction values, reported on a dry-mass basis, are provided for 
additional  fatty  acids,  elements,  and  vitamins  (Tables 4  through  6),  and  for  proximates,  calories,  and  amino  acids 
(Tables 7 and 8).  A NIST reference value is a noncertified value that is the best estimate of the true value based on 
available data; however, the value does not meet the NIST criteria for certification [1] and is provided with associated 
uncertainties that may reflect only measurement reproducibility, may not include all sources of uncertainty, or may 
reflect a lack of sufficient statistical agreement among multiple analytical methods.  The reference mass fraction values 
were derived from results reported by NIST and/or collaborating laboratories. 
 
Information Mass Fraction Values:  Information mass fraction values for several elements are provided in Table 9 
as additional information on the composition of the material.  A NIST information value is considered to be a value 
that may be of interest to the SRM user, but insufficient information is available to assess the uncertainty associated 
with the value, and therefore no uncertainty is provided [1].  Values are reported on a dry-mass basis in mass fraction 
units [5].  Information values cannot be used to establish metrological traceability. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 3290 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until  01 October 2025,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  instructions  given  in  this 
certificate (see “Instructions for Storage and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, 
or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Coordination of the technical measurements leading to the certification of this SRM was performed by M.M. Phillips 
and
and L.J. Wood of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division, K.E. Sharpless of the NIST Special Programs Office, and 
W. Koshute of the Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA, Washington, DC).

NOTICE  TO  USERS:    SRM 3290  IS  INTENDED  FOR  RESEARCH  USE,  NOT  FOR  HUMAN  OR  ANIMAL 
CONSUMPTION. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE AND USE 
 
Storage:  The SRM should be stored at controlled room temperature (20 °C to 25 °C) in the original unopened packets.  
For elemental analyses, the packet can be resealed, stored at controlled room temperature, and test portions removed 
for analysis until the material reaches its expiration date.  For organic analyses, the packet can be resealed, stored at 
room temperature, and test portions removed and analyzed within two weeks after the packet was initially opened. 
 
Use:  Before use, the contents of the packet should be mixed thoroughly.  Allow the contents to settle for one minute 
prior to opening to minimize the loss of fine particles.  To relate analytical determinations to the certified or reference 
values in this certificate, the test portion mass indicated in the description of the NIST analyses for each group of 
analytes below should be used.  The minimum sample mass related to the NIST analytical determinations is described 
in the “Source, Preparation, and Analysis” section.  Results obtained in analyses should include their own estimates 
of uncertainty and can be compared to the certified or reference values using procedures described in reference 6. 
 
Determination of Moisture:  Moisture content of SRM 3290 was determined at NIST by (1) freeze-drying to constant 
mass over 7 d, (2) drying over magnesium perchlorate in a desiccator at room temperature for 21 d; and (3) drying in 
a forced-air oven at 80 °C for 3 h.  Unweighted results obtained using all three techniques were averaged to determine 
a conversion factor of (0.9564 ± 0.0015) gram dry-mass per gram as-received mass, which was used to convert data 
from an as-received to a dry-mass basis; the uncertainty shown on this value is an expanded uncertainty.  A relative 
uncertainty component for the conversion factor (0.08 %) obtained from the moisture measurements is incorporated 
in  the  uncertainties  of  the  certified  and  reference  values,  reported  on  a  dry-mass  basis,  that  are  provided  in  this 
certificate. 
 
SOURCE, PREPARATION, AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Source and Preparation:  SRM 3290 is a blend of commercially available dry cat foods.  The commercial products 
were transferred to High-Purity Standards (Charleston, SC) in the bags in which they were received.  The material 
was  ground,  blended,  and  packaged  in  10 g  aliquots  in  heat-sealed  4 mil  polyethylene  bags  then  sealed  inside 
nitrogen-flushed aluminized plastic bags along  with two silica gel packets.  Following packaging, SRM 3290  was 
irradiated (Neutron Products, Inc., Dickerson, MD) to an absorbed dose of 6.3 kGy to 8.4 kGy.

NIST Analyses for Fatty Acids:  Mass fractions of fatty acids were determined by GC-FID from two 1 g test portions 
from each of 10 packets of SRM 3290.  The dry cat food and internal standards [myristic-d27 and stearic-d35 in toluene 
containing  1 g/L  butylated  hydroxytoluene  (BHT)]  were  extracted  into  a  methanol:toluene  (1:10  volume  fraction) 
solution by sonication, vortexing, centrifuging, and finally transferring the solvent.  The steps were repeated twice 
more using only an addition of toluene containing BHT.  The final volume of 30 mL of toluene and 1 mL of methanol 
was  evaporated  to  2 mL.    At  this  point,  1 mL  of  MethPrep  II  [0.2 N  methanolic  (m-trifluoromethylphenyl) 
trimethylammonium hydroxide, Alltech (Deerfield, IL)] was added volumetrically to the vial.  The vials were then 
manually mixed for approximately 1 min and allowed to equilibrate for at least 1 h prior to transfer to an autosampler 
vial for GC-FID analysis.  The GC-FID was equipped with a 0.25 mm × 100 m biscyanopropyl polysiloxane fused 
silica  capillary  column.    Calibrants  were  prepared  gravimetrically  from  SRM 2377  Fatty  Acid  Methyl  Esters  in 
Isooctane, at levels intended to approximate the levels of the fatty acids in the SRM following extraction.  The same 
internal standard solution was used for the calibrants and samples.  Calculations are based on average response factors 
for the calibrants. 
 
Analytical Approach for Determination of Elements:  Value assignment of the mass fractions of the elements in 
SRM 3290 was based on the combination of measurements from at least two different analytical methods at NIST or 
a  single  NIST  result  and  results  obtained  by  collaborating  laboratories,  where  appropriate.    NIST  provided 
measurements by using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), inductively coupled 
plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), isotope dilution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ID ICP-MS), 
instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA), radiochemical neutron activation analysis (RNAA), and wavelength 
dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (WDXRF). 
 
NIST Analyses for As, Ba, Ca, Cr, Fe, I, K, Mn, Mo, Ni, P, Na, Se, Sr, and Zn using ICP-OES and/or ICP-MS:  Mass 
fractions of barium, calcium, iron, potassium, manganese, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, strontium, and zinc were 
determined by ICP-OES.  Mass fractions of arsenic, barium, chromium, iodine, molybdenum, nickel, selenium, and 
strontium were determined by ICP-MS.  For each technique, duplicate 0.5 g test portions were taken from each of 
either  six  or  ten  packages  of  SRM 3290  and  digested  in  closed  vessels  using  nitric  acid  in  a  microwave  sample 
preparation system.  For the determination of iodine by ICP-MS, ammonium hydroxide was added to samples after 
digestion to raise the pH.  Quantification for all analytes was based on the method of standard additions using the 
SRM 3100 series single element standard solutions. 
 
NIST Analyses for Cd and Pb using ID ICP-MS:  Mass fractions of cadmium and lead were determined by ID ICP-MS 
using duplicate, nominal 1 g test portions taken from each of six packages of SRM 3290.  Samples were spiked with 
isotopically enriched 111Cd and 206Pb and were digested in nitric acid using a microwave sample preparation system 
as described in references 7 and 8.  Sample digests were evaporated to near dryness and a portion was reconstituted 
in dilute nitric acid for analysis.  Lead was measured in standard mode, whereas cadmium was measured in collision 
cell/kinetic energy discrimination  mode.  Quantification  was based on standard solutions prepared from SRM 746 
Cadmium-Vapor Pressure, SRM 3108 Cadmium (Cd) Standard Solution, SRM 3128 Lead (Pb) Standard Solution, 
and a commercial metal sample using isotope dilution. 
 
NIST Analyses for Al, Ca, Cl, Cr, Fe, I, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Se, and Zn using INAA:  Mass fractions of aluminum, 
calcium, chlorine, chromium, iron, iodine, potassium, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, sodium, selenium, and 
zinc were determined by INAA using duplicate 0.25 g test portions taken from each of ten packages of SRM 3290.  
For the analysis of chromium, iron, molybdenum, selenium, and zinc, powders were pressed into cylindrical pellets, 
and samples, standards, and controls were packaged individually in clean polyethylene bags and irradiated individually 
at  20 MW  for  8 h  with  a  180-degree  inversion  after  4 h.    Nuclides  were  counted  for  6 h  after  decays  of  7 d  for 
molybdenum,  for  8 h  after  decays  of  14 days  for  iron,  selenium,  and  zinc,  and  for  4 h  after  decays  of  21 d  for 
chromium.  For analysis of aluminum, calcium, chlorine, iodine,  magnesium,  manganese, potassium, and sodium, 
each sample, standard, or control material was individually irradiated together with one flux monitor foil for 60 s at a 
reactor power of 20 MW.  Nuclides were counted for 5 min to 10 min after decays of 10 min to 15 min.  Quantification 
is based on validated pure metal foils, pure compounds, or SRM 3100 single element standard solutions. 
 
NIST Analyses for As using RNAA:  The mass fraction of arsenic was determined by RNAA from single, nominal 0.3 g 
test portions taken from each of six packets of SRM 3290, and in each of five packets one month later.  Test portions 
were pressed into pellets, packaged individually in clean polyethylene bags, and irradiated individually at 20 MW for 
6 h.  Samples, standards, and controls were combined with 77As prior to chemical separation, then dissolved in nitric 
acid or a mixture of nitric and perchloric acids, and As was separated from the matrix as described in reference 9.  The 
559 keV line from decay of 76As was used for quantification.  The 239 keV line from decay of 77As was evaluated for 
yield determination. 
 
NIST Analyses for Ca, Cl, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, P, and S using WDXRF:  Mass fractions of calcium, chlorine, 
copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, sodium, phosphorous, potassium, and sulfur were measured by WDXRF using 

SRM 3290

duplicate 4.0 g test portions taken from each of six packets of SRM 3290.  Briquettes were prepared for each sample.  
The K-L2,3 characteristic X-ray lines of all elements were used for quantification. 
 
Analytical Approach for Determination of Vitamins:  Value assignment of the mass fractions of the vitamins in 
SRM 3290 was based on the combination of measurements made using analytical methods at NIST and collaborating 
laboratories, where appropriate.  NIST provided measurements by using liquid chromatography (LC) with absorbance 
detection, isotope dilution (ID) with LC and mass spectrometry (MS) or tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), and 
LC-ICP-MS. 
 
NIST Analyses for Ascorbic Acid using LC-Absorbance:  The mass fraction of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) was measured 
in  triplicate  2 g  test  portions  taken  from  each  of  six  packets  of  SRM 3290.   The  sample  was  dissolved  in  30 g  of 
0.1 mol/L HCl.  4-Pyridoxic acid was added as an internal standard, metaphosphoric acid was added to stabilize the 
vitamin  C  in  solution,  and  dithiothreitol  was  added  to  convert  dihydroascorbic  acid  to  total  ascorbic  acid.    The 
solutions were sonicated for 30 min, centrifuged, then filtered prior to LC analysis.  Separations were performed on a 
C18 column with a gradient mobile phase of potassium phosphate (dibasic) and acetonitrile and absorbance detection 
at 243 nm.  Ascorbic acid and 4-pyridoxic acid were monitored at 243 nm and 260 nm, respectively.  The purity of 
the neat calibrant material was determined at NIST using LC-absorbance at 243 nm.  A single internal standard solution 
was used for the calibrants and samples. 
 
NIST  Analyses  for  Thiamine,  Riboflavin,  Niacinamide,  Niacin,  Pantothenic  Acid,  Pyridoxal,  Pyridoxamine,  and 
Pyridoxine  using  ID-LC-MS/MS:    Mass  fractions  of  thiamine,  riboflavin,  niacinamide,  niacin,  pantothenic  acid, 
pyridoxal, pyridoxamine, and pyridoxine were measured by ID-LC-MS/MS in duplicate 2.5 g test portions taken from 
each of 10 packets of SRM 3290.  The analytes and internal standards were extracted into ammonium acetate (adjusted 
to  pH 2.6  with  hydrochloric  acid)  by  rotary  mixing  for  30 min.    Samples  were  centrifuged  and  an  aliquot  of  the 
supernatant  was  analyzed  by  positive-ion  mode  ID-LC-MS/MS.    A  gradient  method  with  an  ammonium  formate 
buffer/methanol  mobile  phase  and  a  C18 column  were  used  for  ID-LC-MS/MS  determination  of  the  vitamins.  
Calibrants  were prepared gravimetrically, at levels intended to approximate the levels of the vitamins in the SRM 
following extraction.  A single internal standard solution was used for the calibrants and samples.  The purity of neat 
calibrant materials was determined at NIST using LC-absorbance, Karl Fischer titration, thermogravimetric analysis, 
and differential scanning calorimetry.  The analyte and internal standard transitions monitored for ID-LC-MS/MS are 
listed in Table 10. 
 
NIST Analyses for Biotin using LC-MS:  The mass fraction of biotin was measured in two 1.0 g test portions taken 
from each of 10 packets of SRM 3290.  2H2-biotin was added as an internal standard.  An aqueous solution of 1.5 % 
formic acid (volume fraction) was added to the samples, which were then subjected to mechanical shaking for 30 min.  
Samples were centrifuged, and biotin and  2H2-biotin were extracted on solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridges and 
eluted with a water/methanol solution containing formic acid for positive ion mode LC-MS analysis.  An isocratic LC 
method with a water/methanol/formic acid mobile phase and a C18 column were used for the determination of biotin.  
Biotin and 2H2-biotin were monitored at m/z 245 and m/z 247, respectively.  Calibrants were prepared gravimetrically, 
at levels intended to approximate the levels of the vitamins in the SRM following extraction.  The purity of the neat 
calibrant material was determined at NIST using quantitative proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.   A 
single internal standard solution was used for the calibrants and samples. 
 
NIST Analyses for Folic Acid using LC-MS/MS:  The mass fraction of folic acid was measured in two 1.0 g test portions 
taken from each of 10 packets of SRM 3290.  13C5-folic acid was added as an internal standard.  A neutral extraction 
buffer was added to the samples, which were then subjected to mechanical shaking for 2 h.  Samples were centrifuged 
and  the  supernatant  was  filtered  prior  to  positive  ion  mode  LC-MS/MS  analysis.    A  gradient  method  with  a 
water/acetonitrile/formic  acid  mobile  phase  and  a  C18 column  were  used  for  LC-MS/MS  determination.    The 
transitions  m/z 442 → 295  and  m/z 447 → 295  were  monitored  for  folic  acid  and  13C5-folic  acid,  respectively.  
Calibrants were prepared gravimetrically, with concentrations assigned spectrophotometrically, at levels intended to 
approximate the levels of the vitamins in the SRM following extraction.  A single internal standard solution was used 
for the calibrants and samples. 
 
NIST Analysis for Free Cyanocobalamin using LC-ICP-MS:  The mass fraction of free cyanocobalamin was measured 
in two 2.0 g test portions taken from each of ten packets of SRM 3290.  Cyanocobalamin was extracted into deionized 
water, samples were centrifuged, and the supernatants were filtered through 0.45 μm nylon filters.  Yttrium was added 
as an internal standard.  A mobile phase of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid in methanol and water and a C18 column 
were used for LC-ICP-MS analysis.  Cobalt and cyanocobalamin were monitored at m/z 59, and yttrium was monitored 
at m/z 89.  The purity of the neat calibrant material was determined at NIST using LC-absorbance. 
 
NIST Analyses for Choline and Carnitine using LC-MS:  Mass fractions of choline and carnitine were measured in 
duplicate  0.5 g  test  portions  taken  from  each  of  10 packets  of  SRM 3290.    Internal  standards  of  d9-choline  and 

SRM 3290 

Page 4 of 14 

d9-carnitine  were  added  to  the  samples.    The  analytes  and  internal  standards  were  extracted  and  hydrolyzed  by 
microwave  digestion  in  1 mol/L hydrochloric  acid  followed  by  enzyme  treatment  with  phospholipase D  prior  to 
analysis by positive-ion mode LC-MS.  A gradient method with an ammonium formate/acetonitrile mobile phase and 
a mixed-mode C18 column were used for LC-MS determination.  Choline and d9-choline were monitored at m/z 104 
and m/z 113, respectively.  Carnitine and d9-carnitine were monitored at m/z 162 and m/z 171, respectively.  Calibrants 
were  prepared  gravimetrically,  at  levels  intended  to  approximate  the  levels  of  choline  and  carnitine  in  the  SRM 
following extraction.  The purity of neat calibrant materials was determined at NIST using quantitative proton nuclear 
magnetic resonance spectroscopy.  A single internal standard solution was used for the calibrants and samples. 
 
Collaborating Laboratories’ Analyses:  The GMA FIACC laboratories were asked to use their usual methods to 
make single measurements of proximates, calories, fatty acids, vitamins, elements, and amino acids on test portions 
taken  from  each  of  two  packets  of  SRM 3290.    Because  of  variability  among  data  provided  by  laboratories 
participating in an interlaboratory comparison exercise, the median of laboratory means is used, with the uncertainty 
estimated using a bootstrap procedure [3,4]. 
 
Homogeneity Assessment:  The homogeneity of elements, water-soluble vitamins, and fatty acids was assessed at 
NIST using the methods and test portion sizes described above.  Analyses of variance showed statistically significant 
heterogeneity  in  some  cases,  and  the  uncertainties  for  biotin  and  free  cyanocobalamin  incorporate  an  additional 
component for possible heterogeneity.  Homogeneity of constituents measured solely by collaborating laboratories 
(e.g.,  proximates,  amino  acids)  was  not  assessed,  although  the  data  were  treated  as  though  these  analytes  were 
homogeneously distributed. 
 
Value Assignment:  For calculation of assigned values for analytes that were measured only by NIST, the mean of 
the mean values from NIST results was used.  The collaborating laboratories reported the individual results for each 
of their analyses for a given analyte.  The mean of each laboratory’s results was then determined.  For calculation of 
assigned values for analytes that were measured only by the collaborating laboratories, the median of the laboratory 
means was used.  For analytes that were also measured by NIST, the median of the individual collaborating laboratory 
means and the means of the individual sets of NIST data were averaged, as appropriate.  For niacin, niacinamide, 
pyridoxamine,  pyridoxal,  and  pyridoxine,  the  calculation  of  assigned  values  is  the  mean  of  the  NIST  results  with 
confirmation  provided  by  the  determined  total  vitamin  value,  based  on  the  combination  of  data  from  NIST  and 
collaborating laboratories.

Certified Mass Fraction Values for Fatty Acids as Free Fatty Acids:  Each certified mass fraction value is the 
combined mean from the mean of NIST GC-FID data and the median of the mean of data provided by collaborating 
laboratories.  The method reported by collaborating laboratories was also GC-FID.  The uncertainty provided with 
each  value  is  an  expanded  uncertainty  about  the  mean  to  cover  the  measurand  with  approximately  95 %  
confidence [2–4].  The measurand is the total mass fraction for each analyte listed in Table 1 on a dry-mass basis.  
Metrological traceability is to the SI derived unit for mass fraction (expressed as grams per 100 grams).

Certified Mass Fraction Values for Vitamins:  Each certified mass fraction value is the combined mean from the 
mean  of  results  from  analyses  provided  by  NIST  and  the  median  of  the  mean  results  provided  by  collaborating 
laboratories, where appropriate.  The uncertainty provided with each value is an expanded uncertainty about the mean 
to  cover  the  measurand  with  approximately  95 %  confidence [2–4].    The  uncertainty  for  biotin  incorporates  an 
additional component for possible inhomogeneity.  The measurand is the total mass fraction for each vitamin listed in
