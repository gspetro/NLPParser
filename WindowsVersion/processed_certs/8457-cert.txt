Reference Material 8457 

Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene 

 

 

0.5 cm Cubes 

 
This  Reference  Material (RM)  is  an  orthopedic  grade  ultra  high  molecular  weight  polyethylene (UHMWPE)  that 
consists  of  0.5 cm  cubes,  machined  from  the  central  portion  of  the  7.62 cm (3.0  inch)  rod  of  RM 8456.    The 
0.5 cm cubes  are  intended  for  use  as  controls  for  evaluations  of  cross-linking  wrought  by  exposure  to  ionizing 
radiation, in particular, to improve wear characteristics.  Cubes of this size are useful for determination of cross-link 
density  by  swelling  measurements.    Similar  cubes,  also  fabricated  from  RM 8456  bar  stock,  were  used  in  an 
interlaboratory comparison of cross-link density measured by a new ASTM method. 
 
This  Reference  Material (RM),  fabricated  from  the  cylindrical  bar  stock  of  NIST  RM 8456,  is  intended  for 
evaluations of cross-linking induced by radiation exposure, such as used to improve wear characteristics.  Each unit 
of  RM 8457  consists  of  10 cubes  of  ultra  high  molecular  weight  polyethylene (UHMWPE)  of  nominal  dimension 
0.5 cm.  The cubes are sized for measurement of cross-link density by swelling.  The material as supplied has not 
been irradiated, however. 
 
Reference Values:  Reference values and uncertainties for dimensions of cubes and surface roughness are shown in 
Table 1.  Reference values are noncertified values that are the best estimate of the true value; however, the values 
DO NOT meet the NIST criteria for certification and are provided with associated uncertainties that may not include 
all sources of uncertainty. 
 
Information Values:  Information values for degree of swelling in xylene at 130 ˚C obtained in a round robin test 
on  gamma-irradiated  cubes  are  given  in  Table 2.    Values  and  uncertainties  for  mechanical  properties  of  the  bar 
stock, RM 8456, from which RM 8457 was machined are shown in Table 3.  The reported mechanical properties are 
Young’s modulus, yield strength, ultimate strength, and elongation.  The composition trace elements and material 
properties of the bar stock from which the cubes were machined are given in Table 4.  The values in Table 4 are 
based on manufacturer-supplied information on the composition and are considered to be information values.  These 
are noncertified values with no reported uncertainties as there is insufficient information to assess uncertainties.  The 
information  values  are  given  to  provide  additional  characterization  of  the  material  and  should  not  be  used  for 
calibration or quality control. 
 
Expiration  of  Value  Assignment:    RM 8457  is  valid,  within  the  measurement  uncertainty  specified,  until 
01 January 2017,  provided  the  RM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  instructions  given  in  this  Report  of 
Investigation  (see  “Instructions  for  Handling,  Storage,  and  Use”).    This  report  is  nullified  if  the  RM  is  damaged, 
contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of RM:  NIST will monitor this RM over the period of its validity.  If substantive technical changes 
occur  that  affect  the  value  assignment  before  the  expiration  of  this  report,  NIST  will  notify  the  purchaser.  
Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
The  overall  direction  and  coordination  of  this  reference  material  were  under  J.A. Tesk  and  B.M. Fanconi  of  the 
Polymers Division.  This RM was fabricated by the NIST Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE1 
 
Source of Material:  RM 8457 cubes were fabricated from one of the cylindrical bars from which test specimens 
were  prepared  for  mechanical  measurements  on  RM 8456 [1].    Only  the  central  5.62 cm (2.21  in)  of  the  bar’s 
diameter  was  used  to  fabricate  the  cubes  because  mechanical  properties  outside  this  area  were  found  to  differ 
statistically [1].  The source material for RM 8456 was Premium Grade UHMWPE bars (Production Code PG9981) 
provided by Poly Hi Solidur, Inc., MediTECH Division Fort Wayne, IN (This material was produced from Virgin 
UHMWPE Raw Material (Lot No. 332945), TICONA GUR 1050). 
 
Storage:  Until required for use, RM 8457 should be stored at room temperature in its original container and not 
exposed to intense, direct light, or ultraviolet radiation. 
 
Use:  The  reference  properties,  cube  dimensions  and  surface  roughness,  represent  mean  values  and  expanded 
uncertainties. 
 
Methods of Analysis Used in Value Assignment 
   
The cubes of RM 8457 were fabricated from one of the cylindrical bars from which test specimens were prepared 
for mechanical measurements on RM 8456 [1].  Only the central 5.62 cm (2.21 in) of the bar’s diameter was used to 
fabricate the cubes because mechanical properties outside this area were found to differ statistically [1].  Preliminary 
measurements  had  shown  that  the  swelling  of  gamma-irradiated  cubes  is  not  truly  isotropic,  hence,  to  reduce 
measurement uncertainties it was necessary to maintain consistency in measuring swelling along the same direction 
for all cubes.  The anisotropic behavior derives from molecular orientation imparted by the extrusion process used to 
produce the bar stock of RM 8456.  Cubes were machined with four of the faces aligned along the axial direction; 
the machining produced linear striations in the axial direction on those four cube faces.  Circular swirls appeared on 
the two faces of the cube that were perpendicular to the axial direction.  These distinguishing surface features are 
evident under low magnification optical microscopy. 
 
Cube Dimensions 
 
The  NIST  Manufacturing  Engineering  Laboratory  fabricated  the  cubes.  After  machining,  the  cubes  were  stored 
together in a plastic bag.  Each cube was examined under an optical microscope for imperfections that resulted from 
the  machining.    Those  that  possessed  burrs  were  discarded  as  well  as  those  whose  edges  were  not  beveled.    The 
three  edge  dimensions  were  measured  with  a  micrometer  on  40 cubes  randomly  selected  from  the  remainder.  
Owing  to  the  different  machining  processes  used  for  faces,  normal  and  perpendicular  to  the  bar  direction,  the 
dimensions in the axial direction were separated from those perpendicular.  The mean and expanded uncertainty of 
the  dimension  in  the  extrusion  direction  were  (0.4919  0.005) cm  and  (0.5017  0.006) cm  in  the  dimension 
perpendicular to the extrusion direction.

Surface Roughness 
 
Measurements of the surface roughness of the cubes were made with a Federal Products Surfanalyzer 5000TM, using 
a probe having a range of  50 μm.  The root mean square surface roughness (Rq ) of the faces normal to the bar 
direction  was  found  to  be  no  more  than  5.5 μm   0.6 μm (0.6  μm  represents  the  95 %  confidence  interval  for 
4 cubes, chosen at random, from which the measurements were made).  The standard deviation of the measurements 
is 0.3 μm.

Table  2  is  based  on  a  round  robin  study  conducted  in  2001  involving  four  sets  of  ultra  high  molecular  weight 
polyethylene test samples tested by six laboratories [2].  For all sets of samples, all the specimens were prepared at 
the same time by the same laboratory.  Each laboratory tested three specimens from each set of samples.  Samples 
from  NIST  Reference  UHMWPE,  RM 8456,  were  machined  into  5 mm  cubes,  packaged  in  nitrogen,  and  sample 
sets were irradiated with one of four gamma irradiation doses (54.2, 71.5, 89.2, and 110.1) kGy.  The data indicate 
that  for  the  range  of  irradiation  doses  currently  used  to  produce  highly  cross-linked  UHMWPE  for  orthopedic 
applications, the swell ratio measurement is associated with interlaboratory expanded relative uncertainty of 8 % to 
11 %.
