Standard  Reference  Material  880 

Nickel  Silver  (CDA  770) 

(in  Cooperation  with  the  American  Society  for  Testing  and  Materials) 

  

  

This  material  is  in  the  form  of  small  granules  prepared  by  water  atomization  and  is  intended  for  use  in  chemical 
and  instrumental  methods  of  analysis. 
A  similar  material  also  is  available  as  SRM  879,  Nickel  Silver  (CDA 
762). 

CAUTION:  The  contents  of  the  bottle  should  be  thoroughly  mixed  before  using.

‘The  certified  value  listed  for  a  constituent  is  the  present  best  estimate  of  the  “true”  value  based  on  results  of  the  cooperative  analytical 
program  for  certification. 

*The  estimated  uncertainty  listed  for  a  constituent  is  based  on  judgment  and  represents  an  evaluation  of  the  combined  effects  of  method 
imprecision,  possible  systematic  errors  among  methods,  and  material  variability  for  samples  0.5  g  or  more.  (No  attempt  was  made  to  derive 
exact  statistical  measures  of  imprecision  because  several  methods  were  involved  in  the  determination  of  most  constituents), 

+A  detailed  description  of  many  of  the  methods  of  analysis  employed  in  the  certification  program  for  this  SRM  may  be  found  in  Part  12, 
Chemical  Analysis  of  Metals  and  Metal  Bearing  Ores,  Annual  Book  of  ASTM  Standards.

PLANNING,  PREPARATION,  TESTING,  ANALYSIS: 

The  material  for  this  SRM  was  prepared  by  the  International  Nickel  Co.,  Inc.,  Sterling  Forest,  Suffern,  New 
York. 

Homogeneity  testing  was  performed  at  NBS  by  R.  K.  Bell,  ASTM-NBS  Assistant  Research  Associate.  The 
material  variability  was  determined  to  be  within  the  method  imprecision.
