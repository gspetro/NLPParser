Standard Reference Material® 2669 
 
Arsenic Species in Frozen Human Urine 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended primarily for validating analytical methods and measurements 
for the determination of arsenic species in human urine.  A unit of SRM 2669 consists of five pouches, each pouch 
containing one vial of Level I and one vial of Level II Arsenic Species in Frozen Human Urine.  Each vial contains 
nominally 1.5 mL of urine.  SRM 2669 is shipped on dry ice, and it should be stored at –80 C until use. 
 
The  development  of  SRM 2669  was  a  collaboration  between  NIST  and  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and 
Prevention (CDC), National Centers for Environmental Health, Division of Laboratory Sciences, (Atlanta, GA). 
 
Certified Values:  Table 1 lists the certified values and expanded uncertainties for arsenic species in SRM 2669.  The 
structural formulas of the arsenic species are shown in the appendix.  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST 
has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or 
taken  into  account [1].    The certified  value  is  the  unweighted  average  of  the  values  from  NIST  and  collaborating 
laboratories.  The expanded uncertainty is calculated as U = kuc, where uc is intended to represent, at the level of one 
standard  deviation,  the  combined  uncertainty  due  to  material  variability  and  measurement  uncertainty  calculated 
according to the method described in the ISO/JCGM Guide [2] and reference 3.  The coverage factor, k, for a 95 % 
confidence interval, equals 2 for all certified values in Table 1. 
 
Reference Values:  Table 2 lists reference values with expanded uncertainties for total arsenic.  Reference values are 
non-certified values that are the best estimate of the true value; however, the values do not meet NIST criteria for 
certification and are provided with associated uncertainties that may not include all sources of uncertainty [1].  The 
reference values are based on results obtained from a single NIST analytical method.  The coverage factors for a 95 % 
confidence interval equal 2.33 and 2.59 for total arsenic in Level I and Level II, respectively. 
 
Information Values:  Table 3 lists information values for trimethylarsine oxide (TMAO) and arsenocholine (AC) in 
Level I.  An information value is considered to be a value that will be of interest to the SRM user, but insufficient 
information is available to assess the uncertainty associated with the value [1].  Information values cannot be used to 
establish metrological traceability. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 2669 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until 31 December 2023, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given in this 
certificate (see “Instructions for Storage and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, 
or otherwise modified.  
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Coordination  of  the  technical  measurements  leading  to  the  certification  was  under  the  direction  of  L.L. Yu  and 
G.C. Turk of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division. 
 
Analytical  measurements  for  certification  of  this  SRM  were  performed  by  W.C. Davis  and  L.L. Yu  of  the  NIST 
Chemical  Sciences Division; C.P. Verdon, C.G.K. Freeman, M. Fresquez, and G. Shakirova of the CDC Inorganic 
and Radiation Analytical Toxicology Branch; and B. Buckley and R. Xie of Rutgers, The State University of New 
Jersey, Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences Institute (Piscataway, NJ).

Partial support for the development of this SRM was provided under the direction of R.L. Jones of the CDC Inorganic 
and Radiation Analytical Toxicology Branch. 
 
Statistical consultation for this SRM was provided by D.D. Leber of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division. 
 
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Office  of  Reference 
Materials. 
 
NOTICE AND WARNING TO USERS 
 
SRM 2669  IS  INTENDED  FOR  RESEARCH  USE.    THIS  IS  A  HUMAN-SOURCE  MATERIAL.    HANDLE 
PRODUCT  AS  A  BIOHAZARDOUS  MATERIAL  CAPABLE  OF  TRANSMITTING  INFECTIOUS  DISEASE.  
Proper protective equipment such as gloves, safety goggles, and laboratory coat should be worn when handling the 
material.    The  SRM  and  anything  in  contact  with  the  SRM  should  be  disinfected  with  10 %  bleach  before  being 
properly disposed. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE AND USE 
 
Storage:  The SRM should be stored at –80 C in the original unopened package.  The certification does not apply to 
contents of previously opened pouches as the stability of all species has not been investigated under such conditions.  
 
Use:  SRM 2669 should be thawed at room temperature.  The material should be used within 4 h after being thawed.  
Unused or remaining material should be discarded after the specified time.  Once the pouches are cut open, each vial 
of the SRM should be homogenized by gently inverting the vial several times before a test portion is removed.  To 
determine arsenic species in the SRM, particulates in the subsample should be removed.  Recommended procedures 
for removal of particulates are: (1) extracting supernatant after centrifuging at 2 × 104 gn for 5 min, or (2) filtration 
using  a  0.45 µm  syringe  filter.    To  determine  the  total  arsenic  in  SRM 2669,  the  entire  subsample,  including 
particulates, should be used.  The recommended minimum sample size for speciation measurement is 0.2 mL.  The 
recommended minimum sample size for total arsenic measurement is 1 mL. 
 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
The urine pool used for the preparation of SRM 2669 was collected at CDC from volunteers in spring 2006.  Each 
urine specimen, collected in plastic cups, was screened for total arsenic and arsenic species and then combined in one 
of three urine pools representing low, medium, and high arsenic levels.  The three urine pools were blended to form 
two pools (Levels I and II) containing arsenic species at the target concentrations (see below).  The urine pools were 
centrifuged at approximately 5 °C, and the precipitates discarded.  The concentrations of the seven arsenic species in 
each pool were adjusted to the target levels (see below) with addition of appropriate amounts of arsenic species.  The 
pools were stirred and were sparged continuously with nitrogen the day before production.  On the day of production, 
the tubing for sparging was withdrawn to the surface of the urine pools to stop sparging while keeping the pools in the 
positively  pressurized  nitrogen  environment.    Aliquots  of  approximately  1.5 mL  of  urine  from  the  pools  were 
dispensed  into  2 mL  cryovials  inside  a  glove  box  continuously  purged  with  nitrogen  to  provide  an  anaerobic 
  The  vials  were  heat-sealed  in  Mylar  bags  containing  oxygen  absorbers  and  stored  at  
environment. 
–80 °C at CDC and then NIST following transfer (on dry ice). 
 
The target levels of arsenic species in Level I and Level II of the SRM were designed to represent approximately the 
50th and 95th percentiles of the concentrations (with some adjustments) in the U.S. population based on preliminary 
data from the recent National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) [4]. 
 
Analytical determinations for certification of this SRM were performed at NIST, CDC, and Rutgers using the methods 
listed in Table 4. 
 

 

                                                           

(1)Certain  commercial  instruments,  materials,  or  processes  are  identified  in  this  certificate  to  adequately  specify  the

and Technology, nor does it imply that the instruments, materials, or processes identified are necessarily the best available for the 
purpose.
