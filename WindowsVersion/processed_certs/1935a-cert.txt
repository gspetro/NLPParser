Certificate of Analysis 
Standard Reference Material® 1935a 

 

 
Potassium Dichromate Solution 
for Use as an Ultraviolet Absorbance Standard 
 

 

This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended for use as a reference standard for verifying the accuracy 
of the absorbance scale of absorption spectrometers that can provide an effective bandpass of 2 nm or less at 235 nm, 
257 nm, 313 nm, and 350 nm.  Such verification is accomplished by comparing the measured apparent absorbances, 
A(meas), to the certified apparent absorbances, A(cert), as described under the “Instructions for Use” section of this 
certificate.  The term “apparent absorbances” is used because no corrections have been applied to the absorbance 
data for the effects of internal multiple reflections within the cuvette.  These corrections do not exceed 0.2 %. The 
nomenclature used in this certificate is that recommended by K.D. Mielenz [1]. 
 
A  unit  of  SRM  1935a  contains  five  blank  solutions  and  five  sample  solutions,  for  a  total  of  ten  ampoules.    The 
nominal  absorbances  referred  to  the  blank,  span  a  range  of  0.3  to  0.9  absorbance  units  over  the  four  certified 
wavelengths  for  a  10  mm  pathlength  cuvette.  Approximately  10  mL  of  each  solution  is  flame-sealed  into  an 
individual  glass  ampoule,  which  has  been  pre-scored  for  easy  opening.    The  blank  and  sample  solutions  are 
packaged in separate trays. 
 
Certified Values:  Table 1 gives the certified values of the apparent net absorbance of SRM 1935a for the indicated 
wavelengths and a 10.00 mm internal pathlength.  The certified values are valid without correction over a temperature 
range of 20 °C to 24 °C and for an instrumental spectral bandpass not to exceed 2 nm. Measurements should be made 
immediately after opening the original ampoules, or within the same day for well sealed cuvettes.

Expiration  of  Certification:  The  certification  of  SRM  1935a  is  valid,  within  the  measurement  uncertainties 
specified,  until  31 December  2014,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  the  instructions 
given in this certificate.  The certified values have been assigned appropriate component uncertainties to account for 
potential drift.  However, the certification is invalid if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, or modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical changes occur that affect the certification before expiration of this certificate, NIST will notify the purchaser.  
Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
The technical measurements leading to the certification of this SRM were performed by M.V. Smith and J.C. Travis 
with supervisory oversight by S. J. Choquette of the NIST Biochemical Science Division.

The statistical design was provided by H-k. Liu of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division. 
 
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the NIST Measurement Services 
Division. 
 
Source and Preparation of Material:  Solutions of 60.20 mg/L of potassium dichromate in 0.001 N perchloric acid 
and the perchloric acid blank were prepared, ampouled, and labeled by the Biochemical Science Division and the 
Measurement Services Division of NIST. 
 
NIST  Certification  Procedure:    The  optical  transmittance  measurements  were  made  on  the  second  generation 
high-accuracy  reference  spectrometer  in  the  NIST  Biochemical  Science  Division.    The  spectrophotometer  was 
constructed  and  calibrated  using  the  principles  of  the  original  instrument  [2].    An  effective  spectral  bandpass  of 
0.8 nm  was  used  for  all  measurements.    The  wavelength  scale  of  the  reference  spectrometer  was  calibrated  to  an 
estimated accuracy of ± 0.1 nm.  The temperature inside the spectrometer sample chamber was 22 °C ± 1 °C during 
the  certification  measurements  and  was  recorded  to  0.1  °C  before  and  after  each  run  for  correction  of  the  data 
to 22 °C. 
 
A  run-order  stratified  random  sampling  was  employed  to  select  SRM  1935a  Potassium  Dichromate,  UV 
Absorbance Standard blank and sample ampoules for certification measurements.  Concurrent measurements were 
made on a like number of control solution ampoules of SRM 1935. Measurements were made in four runs on each 
of  three  days.  In  each  run,  six  solutions  were  measured  in  six  calibrated  SRM 932 Quartz Cuvettes [3] using the 
normal  measurement  protocol  of  the  instrument.    The  order  in  which  the  SRM  932  cuvettes  were  placed  in  the 
sample carriage was the same for all 12 runs. One sample of each of the four solutions (SRM 1935a blank, SRM 
1935a solution, SRM 1935 blank, and SRM 1935 solution) was run in each cuvette on each day. 
 
Assignment of Uncertainties:  Standard uncertainty components, equivalent to the estimated standard deviation for a 
normal  distribution,  were  assigned  for  repeatability,  temporal  drift,  temperature  uncertainty,  instrument  spectral 
bandwidth, and instrument wavelength accuracy.  The repeatability component was computed as the estimated standard 
deviation  of  the  mean  of  18  measured  net  apparent  absorbance  values.    Temporal  drift  uncertainty  was  generously 
estimated from measurements of SRM 1935 over a seven-year period.  Temperature related uncertainty was assigned 
on  the  basis  of  the  temperature  coefficients  given  under  “Temperature  Correction”  below,  to  accommodate  a 
temperature range of 22 °C ± 2 °C.  The instrument spectral bandwidth and wavelength accuracy were estimated from 
the full spectrum of SRM 1935a, shown in Figure 1, to accommodate a maximum spectral bandwidth of 2 nm and a 
wavelength bias of up to ± 1 nm.  The standard uncertainty components were combined using the root-sum-of-squares 
method.  An expansion factor of k = 2 was applied such that the expanded uncertainties given in Table 1 express an 
interval within which the true value is expected to fall with a level of confidence of approximately 95 %. 
  
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 
 
CAUTION:  This SRM is an acid solution contained in tip-sealed borosilicate glass ampoules with pre-scored stems. 
Therefore,  all  appropriate  safety  precautions,  including  use  of  gloves  during  handling,  should  be  taken  to  avoid 
accidental breakage or spillage.  Unopened ampoules should be stored under normal laboratory conditions in an upright 
position inside the original container supplied by NIST. 
 
Opening an Ampoule:  When an ampoule is to be opened, that area of the stem where the pre-scored band is located 
should be carefully wiped with a clean, damp cloth and the body of the ampoule wrapped in absorbent material.  Then 
holding  the  ampoule  steady  and  with  thumb  and  forefinger  grasping  the  stem,  minimal  thumb  pressure  should  be 
applied to the stem to snap it.  Correctly done, the stem should break easily where pre-scored.  Use of a metal file to 
break the stem is NOT recommended. 
 
SRM  1935a  solutions  are  to  be  transferred  sequentially  to  a  fused-silica  cuvette  of  known  pathlength,  b,  and  the 
apparent absorbances measured at wavelengths 235 nm, 257 nm, 313 nm, and 350 nm, using a spectral bandpass 
less than or equal to 2 nm and a wavelength accuracy of at least 1 nm.  The temperature of the sample should be 
determined  to  ±  1  °C.    Clean  borosilicate  pipettes  should  be  employed  to  transfer  solutions  from  the  ~10  mL 
ampoules to the ~3 mL cuvette.  Each ampoule is intended to supply material for two rinsings of the cuvette prior to 
transfer of the final portion for measurement.  For this purpose, the first aliquot of ~3 mL is transferred from the 
freshly  opened  ampoule  into  an  empty  and  clean  cuvette  (a  liquid  height  of  ~3  cm  in  a  cuvette  of  1  cm2  cross 
section)  and  is  then  removed  to  waste  for  proper  disposal  (see  the  Material  Safety  Data  Sheet  [MSDS] 
accompanying the SRM).  A second aliquot is likewise transferred and removed to waste using the same pipette. A 

SRM 1935a

third and final ~3 mL aliquot is transferred from the ampoule with the same pipette, and the apparent absorbances 
are measured.  Following the measurement, the cuvette is emptied to waste with the same pipette and cleaned using 
normal laboratory procedures. The second ampoule required for each measurement (one blank and one sample) is 
treated in like fashion, using a clean pipette to avoid cross contamination.  It is recommended that the same cuvette 
be used in the same orientation for each of the two solutions.  Alternatively, two cuvettes that have been optically 
matched may be employed. 
 
NIST Special Publication 260-54 [4] describes the use of the closely related standard, SRM 935a, and may be consulted 
for a detailed discussion of solution and cuvette handling issues. 
 
Calculations:  The accuracy of the absorbance scale of the spectrometer being tested is ascertained by comparing 
the measured net apparent absorbances, A(meas), for the four wavelengths to the certified values in Table 1.  The 
net apparent absorbance is given as the measured apparent absorbance of the sample solution, As(meas), minus 
the measured apparent absorbance of the blank solution, Ab(meas):  
 
A(meas) = As(meas) – Ab(meas) 
 
If the temperature of the sample chamber during the measurement was outside the temperature range of 20 °C to 24 °C, 
then the measured data should be corrected to the temperature of certification, 22 °C, using the instructions given below 
under “Temperature Correction”. 
 
To  demonstrate  that  a  user’s  measurements  are  traceable  within  acceptable  limits  to  the  accuracy  defined  by 
SRM 1935a,  the  user  must  first  determine  the  required  tolerances  or  acceptable  uncertainty  for  the  application  in 
question.  Multiple measurements should be made for a given filling of each cuvette, with removal and replacement 
of  the  cuvette  between  measurements.    The  user  should  then  compare  the  mean  net  apparent  absorbance  and  the 
user-defined 
uncertainty. 
An acceptable level of agreement between a user’s measurements and the certified value is assured if any part of the 
range  defined  by  the  NIST  certified  value  and  its  expanded  uncertainty  overlaps  any  part  of  the  user’s  tolerance 
band defined by the measured mean and the user-defined level of acceptable uncertainty. 
 
Temperature Correction:  SRM 1935a may be used as an absorbance standard at temperatures in the range 20 °C 
to  30  °C  provided  corrections  are  made  to  the  A(meas)  values.    Over  this  range  the  net  apparent  absorbances 
decrease  approximately  linearly  with  increasing  temperature  for  all  the  wavelengths  given  in  Table  1.    The 
corresponding temperature coefficients, k, for these wavelengths are given in Table 2. 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The value of A(meas, T) at any temperature "T" in the range 20 °C to 30 °C can be corrected to the 22 °C certification 
temperature using the appropriate temperature coefficient and the relation:
