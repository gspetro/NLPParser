Standard  Reference  Material  1816a 

Reference  Fuel  !sooctane 

(2,2,4-Trimethylpentane) 

(In  cooperation  with  the  Service  des  Materiaux 
Ge  Reference  of  the  Bureau  National 
de  Metrologic  in  Paris  France} 

This  Standard  Reference  Material  (SRM)  is  intended  for  use  as  a  primary  standard  in  the  octane  rating  of  motor  a 
aviation  fuels  as  specified  in  ASTM  lest  methods  (see  Volume  05.04,  Annual  Book  of  ASTM  Standards)  and 
evaluating  ASTM  methods  for  chemical  analysis  of  fucls  by  gas  chromatography  (D  2268). 
‘This  SRM  exceeds  | 
ASTM  specification  for  a  reference  fucl.  The  certified  values  are:

0.003  =  0.002% 

Yhe  lead  concentration  in  this  SRM  is  certified  to  be  less  than  10  wg! L. 

The  material  for  this  SRM  was  obtained  from  the  Phillips  Chemical  Co.  through  the  effarts  of  Mr,  J.A.  Grant  of | 
Amoco  OH  Co.  and  the  American  Society  for  Testing  and  Materials  (ASTM),  The  fucl  was  ampouled  under  | 
direction  of  NBS,  and  analyzed  by  NBS,  the  Laboratoric  National  d'  Essais  (LNE),  and  the  Institut  Francais  du  Petr: 
(FP). 

The  hamogeneity  of  this  SRM,  as  determined  by  measurements  an  15  samples,  was  found  to  be  satisfactory. 

All  three  laboratories  followed  the  gas  chromatography  technique  specitied  in  ASTM  Method  D  2268  to  determine 
organic  impurities. 

The  water  content  was  determined  by  L.NE  using  the  classical  Karl  Fischer  method. 

The  results  obtained  by  the  three  laboratories  are  given  below:

The  lead  concentration  was  determined  by  NBS  and  LNE  using  various  modifications  of  ASTM  Method  D  1368- 
while  IFP  used  a  variation  of  atomic  absorption  spectrometry  (D  3237).
