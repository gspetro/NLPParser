This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  a  frozen  fish  tissue  homogenate  that  was  prepared  from  lake  trout 
(Salvelinus namaycush namaycush) collected near the Apostle Islands in Lake Superior (U.S./Canada), and is intended 
primarily for use in evaluating analytical methods for the determination of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners, 
chlorinated pesticides, polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), fatty 
total  mercury,  proximates, 
acids 
α-hexabromocyclododecane (α-HBCD), and selected trace elements in fish tissue and similar matrices.  All of the 
constituents for which certified, reference, and information mass fraction values are provided are naturally present in 
the fish tissue homogenate.  A unit of SRM 1946 consists of five bottles, each containing approximately 7 g to 9 g 
(wet basis) of frozen tissue homogenate. 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values:  Certified mass fraction values are provided in Tables 1, 2, and 3 for selected PCB 
congeners, chlorinated pesticides, and PBDE congeners.  The certified values for PCBs, chlorinated pesticides, and 
PBDEs  are  based  on  results  obtained  from  two  or  more  independent  analytical  techniques.    Certified  values  are 
provided in Table 4 for extractable fat and individual fatty acids.  The certified values for fat and fatty acids are based 
on measurements made by NIST and by collaborating laboratories.  Certified values for methylmercury, total mercury, 
arsenic, and iron are provided in Table 5.  The certified values for methylmercury and these elements are based on results 
from two or more independent analytical techniques performed at NIST and collaborating laboratories.  A NIST certified 
value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of 
bias have been investigated or taken into account [1]. 
 
Reference  Mass  Fraction  Values:    Reference  mass  fraction  values  for  selected  PCB  congeners,  chlorinated 
pesticides, PBDE congeners, PFOS, fatty acids, proximates, caloric content, and elements are provided in Tables 6 
through 9.    Reference  values  are  noncertified  values  that  represent  the  best  estimate  of  the  true  values  based  on 
available data; however, the values do not meet the NIST criteria for certification [1] and are provided with associated 
uncertainties that may reflect only measurement precision, may not include all sources of uncertainty, or may reflect 
a lack of sufficient statistical agreement among multiple analytical methods. 
 
Information Mass Fraction Values:  Information mass fraction values are provided for carbohydrates, two additional 
trace elements, four additional fatty acids, and α-HBCD in Table 10.  An information value is a value that may be of 
use to the SRM user, but insufficient information is available to assess adequately the uncertainty associated with the 
value.  Information values cannot be used to establish metrological traceability. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 1946 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until  31 December 2026,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  instructions  given  in  this 
certificate (see “Instructions for Storage and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, 
or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Coordination of the technical measurements leading to the certification of this SRM was performed by S.A. Wise and 
M.M. Schantz of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division.

NOTICE AND WARNING TO USERS 
 
WARNING: FOR RESEARCH USE; NOT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE AND USE 
 
Storage:  SRM 1946 is packaged as a frozen tissue homogenate in glass bottles.  The tissue homogenate should not 
be allowed to thaw prior to subsampling for analysis.  This material has been stored at NIST at −80 °C (or lower) since 
it was prepared and should be stored by the user at this temperature for the certified values to be valid within the stated 
uncertainties. 
 
Use:  This material is a frozen tissue homogenate.  After extended storage at temperatures of −25 °C or higher, or if 
it is allowed to warm, the tissue homogenate will lose its powder-like form.  For the handling of this material during 
sample  preparation,  the  following  procedures  and  precautions  are  recommended.    If  weighing  relatively  large 
quantities, remove a portion from the bottle and reweigh the bottle to determine the mass of the subsample.  Avoid 
heavy  frost  buildup  by  handling  the  bottles  quickly  and  wiping  them  prior  to  weighing.    For  weighing,  transfer 
subsamples to a pre-cooled, thick-walled glass container rather than a thin-walled plastic container to minimize heat 
transfer to the sample.  If possible, use a cold work space, (e.g., an insulated container with dry ice or liquid nitrogen 
coolant  on  the  bottom  and  pre-cooled  implements,  such  as  Teflon-coated  spatulas,  for  transferring  the  powder).  
Standard  biohazard  safety  practices  and  precautions  for  the  handling  of  biological  tissues  should  be  exercised.  
Subsamples of this SRM for analysis (minimum sample size of 1 g) should be withdrawn from the bottle immediately 
after opening and used without delay for the certified values listed in Tables 1 through 5 to be valid within the stated 
uncertainties.  The mass fractions of constituents in SRM 1946 are reported on a wet-mass basis.  The SRM tissue 
homogenate, as received, contains approximately 71 % moisture.

PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Sample Collection:  SRM 1946 was prepared from fillets from adult lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush namaycush) 
collected near the Apostle Islands in Lake Superior in October 1997.  The fillets were removed from the fish using 
stainless steel knives and placed in Teflon bags.  The tissue was placed on wet ice and transported to NIST where it 
was stored in liquid nitrogen vapor freezers (−120 °C) until processed and bottled.  A total of 78 kg of fillets was 
obtained from approximately 70 fish.  The frozen fillets were pulverized in batches of approximately 350 g using the 
cryogenic  procedure  described  previously [2].   The  pulverized  fish  tissue  was  then  homogenized  in  an  aluminum 
mixing drum in two batches of approximately 40 kg each [3].  The mixing drum was designed to fit inside a liquid 
nitrogen vapor freezer and to rotate in the freezer thereby mixing the frozen tissue powder.  After mixing for 2 h, 
subsamples of approximately 10 g of fish tissue homogenate were aliquoted into pre-cooled glass bottles. 
 
Moisture Content:  The moisture content of the fish tissue homogenate was determined by measuring the mass loss 
from  freeze  drying.    Twelve  bottles  (six  from  each  batch)  of  SRM 1946  were  selected  according  to  a  stratified 
randomization scheme for the drying study.  The entire contents of each glass bottle were transferred to a Teflon bottle 
and dried for 8 days at 1 Pa with a −10 °C shelf temperature and a −50 °C condenser temperature.  Based on these 
studies, the mean moisture content of SRM 1946 is 71.4 % ± 0.1 % (mass fraction expressed as percent ± expanded 
uncertainty  with  k = 2,  approximately  95 %  confidence).    The  mass  fraction  values  are  reported  on  a  wet-mass 
(as-received) basis.  If necessary, the results can be converted to a dry-mass basis by dividing by the conversion factor 
of  0.2863  (grams dry  mass  per  gram wet  mass).    An  uncertainty  component  for  the  conversion  factor (0.41 %) 
obtained from the moisture measurement should be incorporated in the uncertainties of the values provided on this 
certificate if comparing on a dry-mass basis. 
 
PCBs and Chlorinated Pesticides:  The general approach used for the value assignment of mass factions for PCBs 
and  chlorinated  pesticides  in  SRM 1946  was  similar  to  that  reported  for  the  recent  certification  of  several 
environmental matrix SRMs [4] and consisted of combining results from analyses at NIST using a variety of extraction 
techniques and solvents, cleanup/isolation procedures, and chromatographic separation and detection techniques.  This 
approach consisted of Soxhlet extraction and pressurized fluid extraction (PFE) using dichloromethane (DCM) or a 
hexane/acetone mixture; cleanup/isolation using solid-phase extraction (SPE), size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), 
or normal-phase liquid chromatography (LC); followed by analysis using gas chromatography with electron capture 
detection (GC-ECD)  or  gas  chromatography  with  mass  spectrometric  detection (GC/MS)  on  two  columns  with 
different selectivity for the separation of PCBs and chlorinated pesticides. 
 
Three  sets  of  results  were  obtained  by  GC-ECD  and  are  designated  as  GC-ECD (I),  GC-ECD (IIA),  and 
GC-ECD (IIB).    For  the  GC-ECD (I)  analyses,  duplicate  subsamples  of  1 g  from  10 bottles  of  SRM 1946  were 
extracted using PFE with DCM.  SEC was used to remove the majority of the lipid material.  The concentrated eluant 
was then fractionated on a semi-preparative aminopropylsilane column to isolate two fractions containing:  (1) the 
PCBs and the less polar pesticides and (2) the more polar pesticides.  GC-ECD analyses of the two fractions were 
performed  on  a  0.25 mm i.d. × 60 m  fused  silica  capillary  column  with  a  5 %  (mole  fraction)  phenyl 
methylpolysiloxane phase (0.25 µm film thickness) (DB-5, J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA).  For GC-ECD (IIA) and 
GC-ECD (IIB),  4 g  subsamples  from  each  of  six  bottles  were  extracted  using  PFE  with  DCM.    The  SEC  and 
normal-phase LC cleanup steps were the same as for GC-ECD (I).  GC-ECD (IIA) analyses were performed on a 5 % 
phenyl methylpolysiloxane phase as described above, and GC-ECD (IIB) analyses were on a 0.25 mm × 60 m fused 
silica capillary column with nonpolar proprietary phase (0.25 µm film thickness) (DB-XLB, J&W Scientific).  For 
both  GC-ECD  analyses,  two  PCB  congeners  that  are  not  significantly  present  in  the  fish  extract  (PCB 103  and 
PCB 198), and 4,4'-DDT-d8, 4,4'-DDE-d8, 4,4'-DDD-d8, and endosulfan I-d4 were added to the fish tissue prior to 
extraction for use as internal standards for quantification purposes. 
 
Three sets of results were obtained by GC/MS.  For GC/MS (I) and GC/MS (II), 3 g subsamples from six bottles were 
mixed  with  50 g  of  sodium  sulfate  and  Soxhlet  extracted  for  20 h  with  a  mixture  of  hexane:acetone  (1:1 volume 
fraction).  The concentrated extract was treated with concentrated sulfuric acid to remove the majority of the lipid 
material, followed by additional cleanup on a silica solid-phase extraction cartridge with 10 % (volume fraction) DCM 
in hexane.  The extract was then analyzed by GC/MS using the two different columns described above and using 
different  ionization  modes  for  the  mass  spectrometric  detection.    GC/MS (I)  was  performed  using  the  nonpolar 
proprietary  phase (DB-XLB)  with  electron  impact  ionization (EI)  and  GC/MS (II)  was  performed  using  the  5 % 
phenyl methylpolysiloxane phase with negative ion chemical ionization (NICI).  For the GC/MS analyses, PCB 103, 
PCB 198, and 13C-labeled 4,4'-DDT, lindane, PCB 28, PCB 101, PCB 118, PCB 138, PCB 153, and PCB 169 were 
added to the fish tissue prior to extraction for use as internal standards for quantification purposes.

For GC/MS (III) analyses, 1.5 g subsamples from three bottles of SRM 1946 were mixed with sodium sulfate and 
Soxhlet  extracted  with  DCM  for  16 h.    The  concentrated  extract  was  subjected  to  SEC  to  remove  lipid  material, 
followed by additional cleanup on a silica SPE cartridge with 10 % DCM in hexane.  The GC/MS (III) analyses were 
performed using the same column and EI MS detection as in GC/MS (I).  PCB 103, PCB 198, and 4,4'-DDT-d8 were added 
to the fish tissue prior to extraction for use as internal standards for quantification purposes. 
 
In addition to the analyses performed at NIST, SRM 1946 was used in an interlaboratory comparison exercise in 1999 
as  part  of  the  NIST  Intercomparison  Exercise  Program  for  Organic  Contaminants  in  the  Marine  Environment [5].  
Results from 30 laboratories that participated in this exercise (see Appendix A) were used as the seventh data set in 
the determination of the certified values for PCB congeners and chlorinated pesticides in SRM 1946.  The laboratories 
participating  in  this  exercise  used  the  analytical  procedures  routinely  used  in  their  laboratories  to  measure  these 
analytes. 
 
Non-Ortho-Substituted PCBs (NOPCBs):  Three sets of results for NOPCBs (PCB 77, PCB 126, and PCB 169) were 
obtained using GC/MS after LC isolation of the NOPCB fraction [6].  For GC/MS (IV) and GC/MS (V), 1 g subsamples 
from nine bottles of SRM 1946 were mixed with sodium sulfate and extracted using PFE with DCM.  The extracts were 
subjected to SEC to remove lipids followed by normal-phase LC on a semi-preparative aminopropylsilane column with 
hexane as the mobile phase to isolate the PCB fraction.  The PCB fraction was then separated into a ortho-substitued PCB 
fraction and a NOPCB fraction using a 2-(pyrenyl)ethyldimethylsilylated silica (PYE) column (4.6 mm i.d. × 25 cm, 5 µm 
Comosil-PYE, Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) with hexane as the mobile phase.  The NOPCB fraction was then analyzed 
by GC/MS using NICI on a 0.25 mm i.d. × 30 m fused silica capillary column containing a 5 % (mole fraction) diphenyl 
dimethylpolysiloxane phase (HP-5, 0.25 µm film thickness, Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA) [denoted as GC/MS (IV)].  
The same samples were also analyzed by GC with high resolution EI MS on a 0.25 mm i.d. × 30 m fused silica capillary 
column containing a 5 % phenyl methylpolysiloxane phase (DB-5MS, 0.25 µm film thickness, J&W Scientific) [denoted 
as GC/MS (V)].  For GC/MS (VI) subsamples of 5 g from three bottles of SRM 1946 were extracted and the NOPCB 
fraction isolated as described above for GC/MS (IV) and (V).  The NOPCB fractions were analyzed by GC/MS with NICI 
on a 0.25 mm i.d. × 60 m fused silica capillary column with a 5 % phenyl methylpolysiloxane phase (DB-5MS, 0.25 µm 
film thickness). 
 
Homogeneity Assessment for PCB Congeners and Chlorinated Pesticides:  The homogeneity of SRM 1946 was 
assessed by analyzing duplicate samples of 1 g from 10 bottles selected by stratified random sampling.  Samples were 
extracted, processed, and analyzed as described above for GC-ECD (I).  No statistically significant differences among 
bottles were observed for the PCB congeners and chlorinated pesticides at the 1 g sample size. 
 
Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers:  Value assignment of mass fractions for PBDE congeners was based on four sets 
of data (three sets from NIST and one set from a collaborating laboratory) using a variety of extraction, cleanup, and 
quantification  methods.    All  measurements  were  performed  by  using  GC/MS  operated  in  either  electron  impact 
(GC/EI-MS) or negative chemical ionization (GC/NCI-MS) mode. 
 
For two of the NIST data sets, 1 g to 2 g subsamples of tissue from each of five bottles were extracted using PFE with 
DCM.  The concentrated extract was subjected to SEC to remove the majority of the lipids, followed by an additional 
cleanup 
  The  extracts  were  analyzed  by  using  both  
GC/EI-MS  and  GC/NCI-MS  on  a  0.25 mm × 15 m  fused  silica  capillary  column  with  a  5 %  (mole  fraction) 
13C-labeled 
phenyl methylpolysiloxane phase 
0.25 μm film thickness). 
4,4'-dibromodiphenyl ether (PBDE 15) and 13C-labeled 2,2',3,4,5-pentachlorodiphenyl ether (CDE 86) were added to 
the tissue sample prior to extraction for use as internal standards for quantification purposes. 
 
For the third NIST data set, 3 g to 4 g subsamples of tissue from each of six bottles were extracted using PFE with 
DCM.  The extracts were processed as above using SEC followed by a second cleanup step using a 5 % deactivated 
alumina SPE column.  The extracts were analyzed by using GC/EI-MS on a 0.25 mm × 60 m fused silica capillary 
  13C-labeled 
column  with  a  5 %  phenyl methylpolysiloxane phase  (0.25 μm  film 
2,2,4,4',5-pentabromodiphenyl  ether  (PBDE 99)  was  added  to  the  tissue  samples  prior  to  extraction  for  use  as  an 
internal standard for quantification of the PBDEs. 
 
For  the  measurements  from  the  collaborating  laboratory  (Indiana  University),  four  subsamples  of  8 g  were 
Soxhlet-extracted using hexane:acetone (1:1, volume fraction) after spiking with two internal standards, 13C-labeled 
13C-labeled  2,2',3,3',4,4',5,5'-octachlorodiphenyl  ether 
2,3,3',4,4',5-hexachlorodiphenyl  ether (CDE 156)  and 
(CDE 194).  Lipids were removed by adding concentrated H2SO4 and shaking; the organic phase was collected and 
the extracts were further cleaned using a 3 % deactivated silica column and an alumina column in series.  The extracts 
were  analyzed  by  using  GC/NCI-MS  on  a  0.25 mm × 60 m  fused  silica  capillary  column  with  a  5 %  phenyl 
methylpolysiloxane phase (0.25 μm film thickness) (DB-5).  Details of the analyses by the collaborating laboratory 
are presented by Zhu and Hites [7].

Perfluorooctanesulfonic Acid:  Value assignment of mass fractions for PFOS was based on three sets of data (two 
sets from NIST and one set from an interlaboratory study) using a variety of extraction, cleanup, and quantification 
methods.    All  measurements  were  performed  by  using  liquid  chromatography  with  triple  quadrupole  mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). 
 
For NIST PFOS method 1, a known amount of internal standard solution (containing 13C-labeled PFOS) was added 
to a fish tissue sample (approximately 0.5 g), vortexed, and 0.5 mL of HPLC-grade water was added to the sample.  
Three milliliters of 0.01 mol/L of potassium hydroxide in methanol was added to the samples and the samples were 
then sonicated for 30 min.  The supernatant was removed, evaporated to 1 mL, filtered using a Whatman UniPrep 
0.2 µm filter (Stanford, ME), and poured into a clean polypropylene tube.  Ten milliliters of 50 % (volume fraction) 
formic acid in water was added to each extract.  Samples were loaded onto Oasis WAX SPE columns (3 mL, 60 mg, 
30 µm; Waters, Milford, MA).  Compounds of interest were eluted off the columns using methanol followed by 1 % 
(volume  fraction)  ammonium  hydroxide  in  methanol.    Following  concentration,  samples  were  analyzed  using 
LC-MS/MS with a C8 column (Agilent Zorbex Eclipse Plus C8, 100 mm × 2.1 mm × 3.5 μm, Agilent Technologies, 
Santa  Clara, CA)  and  a  pentafluorophenyl (PFP)  column  (Phenomenex  Kinetex  PFP,  50 mm × 3.0 mm × 2.6 μm, 
Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) using both a methanol-ammonium acetate in water gradient method and a formic acid in 
acetonitrile-formic acid in water gradient method.

For NIST PFOS method 2, a known amount of internal standard solution (containing 13C-PFOS) was added to a fish 
tissue sample (approximately 0.5 g), vortexed, and 0.5 mL of HPLC-grade water was added to the sample.  Three 
milliliters of acetonitrile was added to the samples and the samples were then sonicated for 10 min.  The supernatant 
was removed and poured into a clean polypropylene tube.  Samples were solvent exchanged into methanol and then 
loaded  onto  Supelco  Supelclean  ENVI-Carb  SPE  columns  (3 mL,  250 mg  120  to  400 mesh;  Bellefonte, PA). 
Compounds of interest were eluted off the columns using methanol.  Following concentration, samples were analyzed 
using  LC-MS/MS  with  a  C8 column  (Agilent  Zorbex  Eclipse  Plus C8,  100 mm  ×  2.1 mm  ×  3.5 μm,  Agilent 
Technologies,  Santa  Clara, CA)  and  a  PFP  column  (Phenomenex  Kinetex  PFP,  50 mm  ×  3.0 mm  ×  2.6 μm, 
Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) using a methanol-ammonium acetate in water gradient method. 
 
The laboratories participating in the interlaboratory study (see Appendix C) used the analytical methods typically used 
in their laboratories to measure PFOS. 
 
α-Hexabromocyclododecane:  Three sets of results were combined for the information value of α-HBCD.  In all 
three methods, a known amount of internal standard (13C-labeled α-HBCD) was added to replicates of approximately 
3 g  subsamples.    Samples  were  extracted  with  PFE  using  DCM,  cleanup/isolation  was  accomplished  with  SEC 
followed by SPE.  Extracts were analyzed by LC-MS/MS using negative electrospray ionization with separation on 
either an Agilent Eclipse Plus C18 (3.0 mm × 150 mm × 3.5 mm) analytical column (NIST HBCD methods 1 and 2) 
or a Waters YMC Carotenoid S5 C30 (4.6 mm × 250 mm × 5 mm) column (NIST HBCD method 3). 
 
GMA Interlaboratory Comparison Exercise:  Results for proximates, extractable fat, fatty acids, and selected trace 
elements were obtained from an interlaboratory comparison exercise organized in 1999 by the GMA Food Industry 
Analytical  Chemists (FIAC;  11 participating  laboratories,  listed  in  Appendix B).    The  laboratories  listed  in 
Appendix B were asked to use AOAC methods or their equivalent, to make single measurements from each of two 
bottles, and to report the analytical method that was used.  A summary of the methodological information and the 
number of laboratories using a particular analytical technique is provided in Appendix D.  The methods used by NIST 
for these analytes are also included in this listing. 
 
Extractable Fat Determination:  The certified value for extractable fat was determined from the combination of 
results from analyses performed at NIST and the results from the GMA interlaboratory comparison exercise as for 
previous food-matrix SRMs [8].  Two sets of results were obtained at NIST.  Six samples were extracted with DCM 
using PFE and three samples were extracted with DCM using Soxhlet extraction.  For both extraction sets, the extract 
was  evaporatively  concentrated  to  approximately  20 mL  (known  mass)  and  an  aliquot  of  90 µL  was  placed  on  an 
aluminum pan.  The extract on the pan was air dried, and the mass of the dried extract determined.  For the GMA 
study, most of the laboratories used an acid digestion and ether extraction to obtain the extract and then determined 
the extractable fat by drying the extract and determining the mass of the remaining residue (see Appendix D).

Fatty Acids:  The approach for value assignment of mass fractions of individual fatty acids in SRM 1946 was similar 
to that reported for the recent certification of several food-matrix SRMs [8] and consisted of combining results from 
analyses at NIST using gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC-FID) with results from the GMA 
interlaboratory comparison exercise. 
 
For the NIST analyses, duplicate subsamples of approximately 2.5 g from each of nine bottles of SRM 1946 were 
analyzed in three sets of six samples over a three-day period.  The fish tissue samples were mixed with diatomaceous 
earth  and Soxhlet  extracted for  18 h  to 22 h  with  a  mixture  of  1:1 hexane:acetone.    Prior  to  extraction  a  recovery 
standard,  triheneicosanoin  (C21 triglyceride),  was  added  to  the  sample.    Two  fatty  acid  methyl  esters (FAMEs), 
methyltridecanoate  (C13:0 FAME)  and  methyltricosanoate  (C23:0  FAME),  were  added  to  the  extract  for  use  as 
internal  standards for quantification.   The  extract  was  then  subjected  to a  two-step process  employing  methanolic 
sodium  hydroxide  and  boron  trifluoride  to  convert  the  fatty  acids  to  their  methyl  esters  (FAMEs).    FAMEs  were 
extracted  into  hexane,  and  analyzed  by  GC-FID  on  a  0.25 mm i.d. × 30 m  fused  capillary  column  with  a  100 % 
poly(bis cyanopropylsiloxane) phase (SP-2340, 25 µm film thickness, Supelco, Bellefonte, PA). 
 
Proximates:    Results  for  proximates  (solids,  ash,  protein,  and  fat)  were  obtained  from  the  GMA  interlaboratory 
comparison exercise described above. 
 
Methylmercury and Total Mercury:  The general approach for the assignment of values for methylmercury and total 
mercury  was  similar  to  that  used  for  these  analytes  in  recent  marine  tissue  SRMs [9].    The  certified  values  for 
methylmercury  and  total  mercury  are  based  on  results  of  analyses  of  SRM 1946  at  NIST  and  two  collaborating 
laboratories:  the Institute of Applied Physical Chemistry, Research Centre Jülich (Jülich, Germany) and the Jožef 
Stefan Institute (Ljubljana, Slovenia).  For the determination of methylmercury, SRM 1946 was analyzed at NIST 
using microwave digestion under acidic conditions, derivatization (phenylation), and preconcentration using solid-
phase  microextraction (SPME)  followed  by  GC  with  atomic  emission  detection  (GC-AED) [9,10].    The  GC-AED 
analyses were performed using a nonpolar 0.32 mm × 25 m fused silica capillary column with a polydimethylsiloxane 
phase  (0.17 µm  film  thickness)  (HP-1,  Hewlett  Packard,  Wilmington, DE).    For  detection,  the  emission  lines  of 
mercury  at  254 nm  and  carbon  at  264 nm  were  used.    A  total  of  13 subsamples  (0.5 g  to  1 g)  from  6 bottles  of 
SRM 1946  were  analyzed  at NIST.   At  the Research  Centre of  Jülich  the  analytical  procedure for  methylmercury 
consisted of water steam distillation under acid conditions, anion exchange chromatographic separation of inorganic 
mercury and methylmercury, followed by cold vapor atomic absorption spectrometric (CVAAS) detection before and 
after ultraviolet radiation [11-13].  Triplicate subsamples (250 mg to 450 mg) from two bottles of SRM 1946 were 
analyzed.  At the Jožef Stefan Institute, duplicate subsamples (≈500 mg) from six bottles of SRM 1946 were analyzed 
using solid-liquid extraction into toluene followed by GC-ECD [14,15]. 
 
For  total  mercury  measurements  at  NIST,  subsamples  (300 mg  to  500 mg)  from  six  bottles  of  SRM 1946  were 
analyzed.  The analytical procedure consisted of spiking with 201Hg as an internal standard, microwave-assisted acid 
digestion  of  the  tissue,  followed  by  cold  vapor  generation  coupled  with  inductively  coupled  plasma  mass 
spectrometry (CV-ICP-MS)  isotope  ratio  measurements  as  described  by  Christopher  et  al. [16].    For  mercury 
determination at the Research Centre Jülich, triplicate subsamples of 350 mg to 600 mg from two bottles of SRM 1946 
were  digested  with  concentrated  nitric  acid  in  heated  quartz  vessels  closed  with  a  cap  and  then  analyzed  by 
CVAAS) [17].  At the Jožef Stefan Institute, duplicate subsamples (≈300 mg) from six bottles of SRM 1946 were 
digested with acid and analyzed by CVAAS [18,19]. 
 
Additional  Trace  Element  Analyses:    Value  assignment  of  the  mass  fractions  of  selected  trace  elements  was 
accomplished by combining results of the analyses of SRM 1946 at NIST, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) 
Food Composition Laboratory (Beltsville, MD), and one laboratory from the GMA interlaboratory exercise.  Analyses 
were performed at NIST using ICP-MS (cadmium, copper, iron, and selenium) and instrumental neutron activation 
analysis (INAA) (arsenic, iron, selenium, and zinc).  For ICP-MS analyses, six subsamples (1 g) from one bottle were 
digested in 5 mL of concentrated nitric acid in closed vessels in a microwave oven.  The digest was then analyzed by 
ICP-MS with rhodium as an internal standard.  For INAA analyses, the contents of eight bottles of SRM 1946 were 
freeze-dried and ten subsamples (≈200 mg) were pelletized and analyzed as described previously [20]. 
 
USDA used inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) to determine calcium, copper, iron, 
magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, and zinc.  One laboratory from the GMA study provided 
results using ICP-OES (calcium, magnesium, and sodium) and flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) (copper, 
iron, manganese, potassium, and zinc).

(a) PCB congeners are numbered according to the scheme proposed by Ballschmiter and Zell [21] and later revised by Schulte and 
nd
Malisch [22]  to  conform  with  IUPAC  rules;  for  the  specific  congeners  listed  in  this  table,  only  PCB 107  and  PCB 201  are 
different  in  the  numbering  systems.    Under  the  Ballschmiter  and  Zell  numbering  system,  the  IUPAC  PCB 107  is  listed  as 
PCB 108 and the IUPAC PCB 201 is listed as PCB 200. 

(b) Unless otherwise noted, the reference values are the weighted mean of the results from two to five analytical methods.  The 
uncertainty  listed  with  each  value  is  an  expanded  uncertainty  about  the  mean,  with  coverage  factor 2  (approximately  95 % 
confidence),  calculated  by  combining  a  between-method  variance [23]  incorporating  inter-method  bias  with  a  pooled, 
within-method variance following the ISO/JCGM Guide [24,25].  The measurand is the total mass fraction on a wet-mass basis 
for  the  selected  PCB  congeners,  pesticides,  and  PBDE congeners  listed  in  Table 6  as  determined  by  the  methods  indicted.  
Metrological traceability is to the SI derived unit for mass faction (expressed as micrograms per kilogram).
