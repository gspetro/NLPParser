Standard Reference Material® 1954 
 
Organic Contaminants in Fortified Human Milk 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended for use in evaluating analytical methods for the determination of 
selected  polychlorinated  biphenyl  (PCB)  congeners,  chlorinated  pesticides,  and  polybrominated  diphenyl  ether 
(PBDE)  congeners  in  human  milk  and  similar  matrices.    Reference  concentration  values  are  provided  for 
polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), as well as some inorganic 
constituents.  An information concentration value is provided for the PCB mixture Aroclor 1260.  The compounds in 
Appendix A were spiked into the milk prior to bottling.  A unit of SRM 1954 consists of five bottles of approximately 
5 mL fortified human milk.   
 
The  development  of  SRM  1954  was  a  collaboration  between  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology 
(NIST) and the Division of Laboratory Sciences, Organic Analytical Toxicology Branch, U.S. Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC). 
 
Certified  Concentration  Values:    Certified  values  for  concentrations,  expressed  as  mass  fractions,  for  PCB 
congeners, chlorinated pesticides, and PBDE congeners along with 1 polybrominated biphenyl congener are provided 
in Tables 1, 2, and 3, respectively.  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its 
accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [1].  The certified 
values  for the PCB congeners,  chlorinated pesticides, and PBDE congeners are based on the agreement of results 
obtained  at  NIST  using  one  or  more  analytical  techniques  and  additional  results  from  the  CDC  and  from  an 
interlaboratory study using different analytical techniques. 
 
Reference Concentration Values:  Reference concentration values, expressed as mass fractions, are provided in 
Table 4 for additional PCB, chlorinated pesticides, and PBDE congeners; in Table 5 for elements; and in Table 6 
for  PCDD  and  PCDF  congeners.    Reference  values  are  noncertified  values  that  are  estimates  of  the  true  value; 
however, the values do not meet the NIST criteria for certification and are provided with associated uncertainties that 
may reflect only measurement precision, may not include all sources of uncertainty, or may reflect a lack of sufficient 
statistical agreement among multiple analytical methods [1]. 
 
Information Concentration Values:  An information concentration value for Aroclor 1260 is provided in Table 7.  
An information value is considered to be a value that will be of use to the SRM user, but insufficient information is 
available to assess the uncertainty associated with the value or only a limited number of analyses were performed [1].  
Information values cannot be used to establish metrological traceability.  
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 1954 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until 31 August 2025, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with instructions given in this certificate 
(see  “Instructions  for  Storage  and  Use”).    The  certification  is  nullified  if  the  SRM  is  damaged,  contaminated,  or 
otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Overall direction and coordination of technical measurements leading to certification were performed by L.C. Sander 
and S.A. Wise of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division and M.M. Schantz formerly of NIST.

NOTICE AND WARNING TO USERS 
 
SRM  1954  IS  INTENDED  FOR  RESEARCH  USE.    THIS  IS  A  HUMAN  SOURCE  MATERIAL.    HANDLE 
PRODUCT  AS  A  BIOHAZARDOUS  MATERIAL  CAPABLE  OF  TRANSMITTING  INFECTIOUS  DISEASE.  
The milk was pasteurized prior to preparation of SRM 1954.  However, no known test method can offer complete 
assurance that infectious agents are absent from this material.  Accordingly, this human milk-based product should be 
handled  at  the  Biosafety  Level  2  or  higher  as  recommended  for  any  POTENTIALLY  INFECTIOUS  HUMAN 
SPECIMEN in the CDC/National Institutes of Health (NIH) Manual [2].   
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE AND USE 
 
Storage:  The milk is frozen and should be stored in a freezer at –20 °C until use.  It should not be exposed to sunlight 
or ultraviolet radiation.  After thawing, the contents should be used immediately. 
 
Use:  Bring the vial to room temperature.  Once the milk is thawed, mix contents by gently swirling.  Do not shake 
vigorously because this will cause frothing.  The recommended minimum sample size is 0.25 g. 
 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Source  of  Material:    Milk  was  acquired  from  six  milk  banks  located  around  the  U.S:    Florida (4 %), 
North Carolina (6 %), Iowa (6 %), Delaware (7 %), California (12 %), and Texas (65 %).   
 
Preparation of Material:  The milk was pooled (approximately 100 L total) and was stored at 4 °C.  The pool was 
split  into  two  for  production  of  SRM 1953  Organic  Contaminants  in  Non-Fortified  Human  Milk  and  SRM 1954.  
Before  bottling,  approximately  710 mL  of  methanol  containing  169  compounds  at  varying  concentrations 
(Appendix A) was added to 50 L of milk, which was then stirred for 4 h.  Using a calibrated automatic pipetter, 5 mL 
aliquots of milk were dispensed into 10 mL amber glass vials. 
 
Analytical Methods Used at NIST:  For NIST  Method 1, the frozen  milk in each of ten bottles  was thawed.    A 
known  amount  of  internal  standard  solution  (containing  selected  13C-labeled  PCB  congeners,  selected 
13C-labeled pesticides,  13C-labeled PBDE 209, fluorinated PBDE 47, PCB 103, and PCB 198) was added to  
each  bottle,  sonicated  for  15 min  and  allowed  to  equilibrate  overnight  under  refrigeration.    After  samples  were 
removed  from  refrigeration  and  allowed  to  reach  ambient  temperature,  10 mL  of  formic  acid  was  added,  as  a 
denaturation agent, followed immediately by 10 mL of a 1+1 (volume fraction) mixture of n-hexane:methyl-tert-butyl 
ether  for  extraction.    The  samples  were  vortexed  and  left  to  stand  for  0.5 h  with  occasional  stirring.    After 
centrifugation to obtain a sharp phase boundary, the upper organic phase was transferred to a concentration vessel.  
The extraction was repeated two more times with 10 mL of n-hexane each time.  The combined organic layers were 
concentrated to approximately 4 mL using an automated evaporation system.  Approximately 2 mL of concentrated 
sulfuric acid was added to the concentration vessel with swirling.  Following phase separation, the organic phase was 
removed,  and  the  sulfuric  acid  phase  was  washed  twice  using  4 mL  portions  of  n-hexane.   The  combined  hexane 
phases were concentrated to approximately 0.5 mL for silica solid-phase extraction (SPE) clean-up.  The fraction of 
interest was eluted with 15 mL of 10 % (volume fraction) dichloromethane in hexane.  The concentrated samples were 
                                                           

(1) Certain  commercial  equipment,  instruments  or  materials  are  identified  in  this  certificate  to  adequately  specify  the 
experimental procedure.  Such identification does not imply recommendation or endorsement by the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the purpose.

analyzed  using  gas  chromatography/mass  spectrometry  (GC/MS)  operated  in  both  the  electron  impact  (EI)  and 
negative  ion  chemical  ionization  (NICI)  mode.    A  0.25 mm × 60 m  fused  silica  capillary  column  containing  a 
non-polar proprietary phase (DB-XLB, Agilent Technologies, Wilmington, DE) 0.25 µm film thickness was used for 
the EI analysis (NIST Method 1a) while a 0.25 mm × 60 m fused silica capillary column containing a 50 % (mole 
fraction)  phenyl-substituted  methylpolysiloxane  phase  (DB-17MS,  Agilent  Technologies)  was  used  for  the  NICI 
analysis (NIST Method 1b).  All injections were 1 µL using an on-column inlet. 
 
For NIST Method 2, the frozen  milk in each of six bottles  was thawed.    A  known  amount  of  internal  standard 
solution (containing selected  13C-labeled PCB congeners, selected  13C-labeled pesticides,  13C-labeled PBDE 
209,  and  selected  fluorinated  PBDE  congeners)  was  added  to  a  2.5  g  milk  test  portion  from  each  bottle, 
vortexed, and allowed to equilibrate overnight under refrigeration.  After samples were removed from refrigeration 
and allowed to reach ambient temperature, 2 mL of formic acid was added followed by 3 mL of 20 % (volume fraction) 
dichloromethane  in  hexane.    Samples  were  extracted  using  focused  microwave  extraction.    Following  extraction, 
samples  were  centrifuged,  the  organic  phase  was  removed,  and  another  3 mL  of  20 %  (volume  fraction) 
dichloromethane  in  hexane  was  added.    The  extraction  was  repeated,  and  the  organic  phases  were  combined.  
Following  concentration  with  a  solvent  exchange  to  iso-octane,  sulfuric  acid-silica  column  clean-up  was  used, 
followed by alumina column (5 % deactivated) clean-up.  The eluant from the clean-up columns was concentrated to 
0.2 mL with a solvent change to iso-octane for analysis.  The concentrated samples were analyzed using GC/MS in 
the EI mode (NIST Method 2a) with a 0.18 mm × 30 m fused silica capillary column containing a 5 % (mole fraction) 
phenyl-substituted methylpolysiloxane phase (DB-5MS, Agilent Technologies) 0.18 µm film thickness.  All injections 
were 20 µL using a programmable temperature vaporization (PTV) inlet.  For NIST Method 2b, the same extracts 
were analyzed by GC/MS in the NICI mode using on-column injection into a 0.18 mm × 10 m fused silica capillary 
column  containing  a  5 %  (mole  fraction)  phenyl-substituted  methylpolysiloxane  phase  (DB-5MS,  Agilent 
Technologies), 0.18 µm film thickness. 
 
For all of the NIST methods, multi-point calibration response curves  for the compounds of interest relative to the 
internal  standards  were  determined  by  processing  gravimetrically  diluted  solutions  of  SRM 2261,  SRM 2262, 
SRM 2274,  and  SRM  2275  plus  gravimetrically  prepared  solutions  of  the  additional  analytes  of  interest  with  the 
internal standards added.  
  
Analytical Methods Used at CDC:  Details of the analytical methods used at CDC can be found in Patterson and 
Turner [3] and Sjödin et al. [4].  In summary, the frozen milk was thawed and mixed.  Sample extraction was performed 
using  a  C18  SPE  method.    After  addition  of  the  internal  standard  solution  and  formic  acid,  the  sample  was  eluted 
through an SPE column using appropriate solvents.  The eluant was then cleaned up using a Universal Prep system 
(Fluid Management Systems, Waltham, MA) containing an acid/neutral/base silica column, an alumina column, and 
a  carbon  column.    Corresponding  13C-labeled  compounds  were  used  as  internal  standards  for  the  majority  of  the 
analytes. 
 
Gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC/HRMS) with mass resolution of 10 000 was used for the 
determination  of  the  PCBs,  chlorinated  pesticides,  PBDEs,  PCDDs,  and  PCDFs.    The  GC  column  was  a 
0.25 mm × 30 m fused silica capillary column containing a 5 % (mole fraction) phenyl-substituted methylpolysiloxane 
phase (DB-5MS, J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA), 0.25 µm film thickness.  All injections were splitless with helium as 
the carrier gas. 
 
Interlaboratory Study:  The three laboratories participating in the interlaboratory study used their usual methods for 
these analyses.  Not every laboratory reported data for every analyte.  When more than one laboratory did report data 
for a particular analyte, the mean of the concentrations was used for combination with other data to assign the certified 
and reference concentration values.  
 
 
Non-Volatile Extractable Mass Determination:  The percent of non-volatile extractable material (or total extractable 
organics, TEO) was determined gravimetrically for the data sets described above.  Non-volatile extractable material is 
3.21 %  0.33 % (95% confidence interval for the mean). 
 
Total Mercury:  The concentration value for mercury is derived from isotope dilution cold vapor inductively coupled 
plasma mass spectrometry measurements performed at NIST [5–7]. 
 
Other Elements: The concentration values for calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, potassium, 
sodium, and zinc were measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES).  Test 
portions (10 g) were digested in nitric acid.  To correct for matrix effects caused by differences between samples and 
calibrants, the method of standard additions was used.  Results from the ICP-OES measurement were corrected for 
spike recoveries.

Homogeneity Assessment:    The  homogeneity  of  PCBs,  pesticides,  and  PBDEs  was  assessed  at  NIST  by  using 
Method 1.  An analysis of variance did not show inhomogeneity for a 5 g sample.  Other analytes were treated as 
though they were homogeneously distributed in the material although homogeneity was not assessed.

(a) PCB congeners are numbered according to the scheme proposed by Ballschmiter and Zell [8] and later revised by Schulte and 
Malisch [9] to conform with IUPAC rules.  For the specific congeners mentioned in this table, PCB 199 is PCB 201 under the 
Ballschmiter and Zell scheme.   When two congeners are known to coelute under the GC analysis conditions used, the PCB 
congener listed first is the major component and the additional congeners may be present as minor components.  The quantitative 
results are based on the response of the congener listed first.
