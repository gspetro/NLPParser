‘This  Standard  Reference  Matcrial  (SRM)  is  intended  for  use  as  a  primary  standard  in  the  octane  rating  of  motor  ar 
aviation  fuels  as  specified  in  ASTM  test  methods  (see  Volume  05.04,  Annual  Book  of  ASTM  Standards)  and 
This  SRM  exceeds  tl 
evaluating  ASTM  methods  for  chemical  analysis  of  fucls  by  gas  chromatography  (D  2268). 
ASTM  specification  for  a  reference  fuel. 

The  certified  values  are:

0.002  =  0.001% 

The  lead  concentration  in  this  SRM  is  certified  to  be  less  than  10  wef. 
The  material  for  this  SRM  was  obtained  from  the  ELF  Company  in  France,  ampouled  by  the  Laboratoire  Nation 
d'Essais  (LNE),  and  analyzed  by  NBS,  LINE,  and  the  Institut  Francais  du  Petrole  (IFP) 
The  homogeneity  ef  this  SRM,  as  determined  by  LNE  using  the  gas  chromatography  technique,  was  judged  to 
satisfactory  when  the  first  three  ampouled  series  and  the  two  ampoules  of  the  following  scrics  were  discarded. 
All  three  laboratories  followed  the  gas  chromatography  technique  specified  in  ASTM  Method  D  2268  to  determine  t 
organic  impurities. 

The  water  content  was  determined  by  LNE  using  the  classical  Karl  Fischer  method.

The  lead  concentration  was  determined  by  NBS  and  LNE  using  various  modifications  of  ASTM  Method  D  1368- 
while  IFP  used  a  variation  of  atomic  absorption  spectrametry  {D  3237).
