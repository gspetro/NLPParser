Certificate of Analysis 
 
Standard Reference Material® 158a 
 
Silicon Bronze 
(chip form) 

a  laboratory’s  in 

 
This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  use  in  validation  of  chemical  and  instrumental 
methods of analysis for element contents of bronze alloys and materials of similar matrix.  It can be used to validate 
containing 
value assignment of a laboratory’s in-house reference materials.  A unit of SRM 158a consists of one bottle containing 
hine 
approximately 150 g of chips produced by a milling machine. 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values:  Certified  values  for constituents of SRM 158a are reported in Table 1 as mass 
fractions of the elements in a bronze alloy matrix [1].  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest 
confidence in its accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been taken into account [2].  A certified 
value is the present best estimate of the true value.  The certified values are metrologically traceable to the SI derived 
unit of mass fraction (expressed as percent).  The expanded uncertainty estimates are expressed at a confidence level 
of approximately 95 %, calculated following the ISO/JCGM Guide [3−10].

Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 158a is valid indefinitely within the measurement uncertainty 
instructions  given  in  this  certificate  (see 
specified,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  instructions  given  in  this  certificate  (see 
“Instructions for Handling, Storage, and Use”).  Periodic recertification of this SRM is not required.  The certification 
is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
,  NIST  will  notify  the  purchaser.
technical changes occur that affect the certification before the expiration of this certificate, NIST will notify the purchaser.  
Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Coordination of technical measurements for certification was performed by R.K. Bell, formerly of NIST.  Review and 
revision of values and uncertainty estimates was coordinated by J.R. Sieber of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division. 
 
Statistical consultation for this SRM was provided by A. Possolo of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division.

Materials. 
 
ING,  STORAGE,  AND  USE 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
Silicon bronze chips may be analyzed in the as-received form.  Test methods used to characterize the material used 
sample quantities of 2 g or more.  While the material is believed to be homogeneous at lower quantities, it has not 
ot 
been tested in amounts < 2 g.  Before sampling, it is recommended to mix bottle contents by inverting and rotating the 
bottle by hand for at least one minute.  A bottle containing unused material should be recapped immediately and stored 
at room temperature away from light. 
 
To use the uncertainty estimates given in this certificate, divide the expanded uncertainty by a coverage factor of k = 2 
to obtain the combined standard uncertainty.  The effective degrees of freedom of the combined standard uncertainty 
are ≥ 60. 
 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
The  material  was  sieved,  blended  and  bottled  at  NIST.    Homogeneity  testing  of  samples  from  the  final  lot  was 
performed J.E. Cumbo, Airco Alloys (Niagara Falls, NY) and J.C. Cline, Interlake, Inc. (Beverly, OH).  Analyses for 
certification were performed using the test methods listed in Table 2. 
 
Analyses  leading  to  the  certification  of  this  SRM  were  performed  at  NIST  by  R.K. Bell  and  E.E. Maczkowske, 
formerly  of  NIST. 
  Analytical  determinations  were  also  performed  by  A.W. Young,  Bridgeport  Brass 
(Bridgeport, CT);  E.L. Smith,  H.J. Smith,  R.C. Burnham,  and  A.B. Feest,  Chase  Brass  and  Copper  Co. 
(Waterbury, CT); O.P. Case, G.A. Reihl, W.T. Taras, and K.M. O’Brien, The American Brass Co. (Waterbury, CT); 
and K.H. Storks, E. Bloom, Jr., and E.K. Jaycox, Bell Telephone Laboratories (Murray Hill, NJ).

Information Mass Fraction Values:  Information values for constituents in SRM 158a are reported as mass fractions 
in Table 3.  An information value is a value that may be of interest to the SRM user, but insufficient information is 
available  to  assess  the  uncertainty  associated  with  the  value [2].    Information  values  cannot  be  used  to  establish

NOTICE TO USERS 
 
NIST strives to maintain the SRM inventory supply, but NIST cannot guarantee the continued or continuous supply 
of any specific SRM.  Accordingly, NIST encourages the use of this SRM as a primary benchmark for the quality and 
accuracy  of  the  user’s  in-house  reference  materials  and  working  standards.    As  such,  the  SRM  should  be  used  to 
validate the more routinely used reference materials in a laboratory.  Comparisons between the SRM and a laboratory’s 
in-house  reference  materials  or  working  measurement  standards  should  take  place  at  intervals  appropriate  to  the 
conservation of the SRM and the stability of relevant in-house materials.  For further guidance on how this approach 
can be implemented, contact NIST by email at srms@nist.gov.
