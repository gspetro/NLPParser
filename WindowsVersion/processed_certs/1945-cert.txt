Certificate of Analysis 
Standard Reference Material® 1945 
 
Organics in Whale Blubber 

 

 
tended  for  use  in  evaluating  analytical 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is a frozen whale blubber homogenate intended for use in evaluating analytical 
methods  for  the  determination  of  selected  polychlorinated  biphenyl (PCB)  congeners,  chlorinated  pesticides, 
polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners, and toxaphene congeners [1].  SRM 1945 has been reanalyzed, and 
the current Certificate of Analysis has values assigned for additional PCB congeners and pesticides, as well as values 
assigned for selected PBDE and toxaphene congeners.  A unit of SRM 1945 consists of two screw-capped glass bottles, 
each containing approximately 15 g of frozen whale blubber homogenate. 
 
Certified  Mass  Fraction  Values:    The  measured  is  the  total  mass  fraction  for  each  PCB  congeners,  chlorinated 
pesticides,  and  PBDE  congeners  provided  in  Tables 1,  2,  and  3,  respectively.    Metrological  traceability  is  the  SI 
derived unit for mass fraction (expressed as micrograms per kilogram on a wet basis).  A NIST certified value is a 
value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias have 
been investigated or taken into account [2].  The certified values for the PCB congeners, chlorinated pesticides, and 
PBDE congeners are based on the agreement of results obtained at NIST from two or more chemically independent 
analytical techniques along with results from an interlaboratory comparison study. 
 
Reference  Mass  Fraction  Values:    The  measured  is  the  total  mass  fraction  based  on  the  indicated  method  or 
methods 
for  additional  PCB  congeners,  a  chlorinated  pesticide,  additional  PBDE  congeners,  and 
2 methoxylated-PBDEs (MeO-PBDEs)  in Table 4  and  for 3 toxaphene congeners and total toxaphene in Table 5.  
Metrological traceability is the SI derived unit for  mass  fraction (expressed as  micrograms per kilogram on a  wet 
basis).  Reference values are noncertified values that represent a best estimate of the true value; however, the values 
do not meet the NIST criteria for certification [2] and are provided with associated uncertainties that may reflect only 
measurement  precision,  may  not  include  all  sources  of  uncertainty,  or  may  reflect  a  lack  of  sufficient  statistical 
agreement among multiple analytical methods. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 1945 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until 31 July 2026, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with instructions given in this certificate 
(see  “Instructions  for  Storage  and  Use”).    The  certification  is  nullified  if  the  SRM  is  damaged,  contaminated,  or 
otherwise modified.   
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Coordination of technical measurements leading to certification of SRM 1945 were performed by M.M. Schantz and 
J.R. Kucklick of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division. 
 
Analytical  measurements  at  NIST  were  performed  by  J.M. Keller,  J.R. Kucklick,  D.L. Poster,  H.M. Stapleton, 
M.M. Schantz, and J.E. Yordy of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division.  Results were also used from 26 laboratories 
(see Appendix A) that participated in an interlaboratory comparison exercise coordinated by NIST. 
 
Evaluation of the data was provided by S.D. Leigh of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division.

NOTICE AND WARNING TO USERS 
 
WARNING:  FOR RESEARCH USE; NOT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE AND USE 
 
Storage:  SRM 1945 is provided as a frozen tissue homogenate in glass bottles.  The tissue homogenate should not be 
allowed to thaw prior to subsampling for analysis.  This material has been stored at NIST at –80 °C (or lower) since it 
was prepared.  SRM 1945 should be stored at or less than –80 °C , if possible, since the validity of the certified values at 
higher temperatures is unknown.  
 
Use:  This material is a frozen tissue homogenate; after extended storage at temperatures of –25 °C or higher, or if allowed 
to warm, it will lose its powder-like form.  For the handling of this material during sample preparation, the following 
procedures and precautions are recommended.  If weighing relatively large quantities, remove a portion from the bottle 
and reweigh the bottle to determine the mass of the subsample.  (Avoid heavy frost buildup on the containers by rapid 
handling and wiping of the containers prior to weighing.)  Transfer subsamples to another container for weighing, using 
a  pre-cooled  thick-walled  glass  container  rather  than  a  thin-walled  plastic  container  to  minimize  heat  transfer  to  the 
sample.  If possible, use a cold work space, e.g., an insulated container with dry ice or liquid nitrogen coolant on the 
bottom and pre-cooled implements, such as Teflon-coated spatulas, for transferring the powder. 
 
Subsamples of this SRM for analysis should be withdrawn from bottles immediately after opening and used without 
delay for the certified values listed in Tables 1, 2, and 3 to be valid within the stated uncertainties.  The bottles should be 
tightly closed immediately after removal of the subsamples and the remaining material may be frozen for use in later 
analyses.  The concentrations of constituents in SRM 1945 are reported on a wet-mass basis.   
 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
SRM Preparation:  The whale blubber used to prepare this SRM was collected from an adult female pilot whale which 
was stranded on Cape Cod, MA in September 1991.  The blubber tissue was placed in Teflon bags, frozen on dry ice, 
shipped to NIST, and placed in a liquid nitrogen freezer (–150 °C).  At NIST, any remaining skin was removed using a 
titanium knife, and the blubber was again placed in Teflon bags and immediately returned to a liquid nitrogen freezer.  
Approximately 15 kg of whale blubber were prepared for use as the SRM.  The frozen whale blubber was pulverized in 
batches of approximately 150 g each, using a cryogenic grinding procedure described previously [3].  The total 15 kg of 
pulverized material was then combined and thoroughly mixed with a Teflon paddle.  Subsamples (10 g to15 g) of the 
whale blubber homogenate were aliquoted into pre-cooled glass bottles and stored at –80 °C. 
 
INTEREST 
ANALYTICAL METHODS USED FOR THE ANALYTES OF INTEREST 
 
Up  to  nine  sets  of  data  were  used  for  determination  of  the  analytes  of  interest  in  SRM 1945.    One  method  used  gas 
chromatography with electron capture detection (GC-ECD) on dual columns described below; six methods used GC with mass 
spectrometry (GC/MS)  on  three  columns  of  differing  polarity  described  below;  and  one  data  set  was  the  combination  of 
consensus means from four interlaboratory comparison studies coordinated by NIST as described below.  For all of the NIST 
methods described below (GC-ECD and GC/MS), multi-point calibration response curves for the PCB congeners, chlorinated 
pesticides,  and  PBDE  congeners  relative  to  the  internal  standards  were  determined  by  processing  gravimetrically-diluted 
solutions of SRM 2261 Chlorinated Pesticides in Hexane (Nominal Mass Concentration 2 μg/mL), SRM 2262  Chlorinated 
Biphenyl Congeners in 2,2,4-Trimethylpentane (Nominal Concentration 2 μg/mL), SRM 2274 PCB Congener Solution-II in 
Isooctane,  and  SRM 2275  Chlorinated  Pesticide  Solution-II  in  Isooctane  plus  gravimetrically  prepared  solutions  of  the 
additional analytes of interest with the internal standards added.

GC-ECD:  For the GC-ECD analyses, approximately 2 g subsamples from 24 bottles of SRM 1945 were extracted 
using pressurized fluid extraction (PFE) with dichloromethane (DCM).  Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) with a 
preparative-scale divinylbenzene-polystyrene column (10 µm particle size with 100 Å diameter pores) was used to 
remove the high molecular mass compounds.  The concentrated extract was then fractionated on a semi-preparative 
aminopropylsilane column to isolate two fractions containing:  (1) the PCBs and lower polarity pesticides and (2) the 
more polar pesticides.  GC-ECD analyses of the two fractions were performed on two columns of different selectivities 
for PCB separations:  0.25 mm × 60 m fused silica capillary column  with a 5 % (mole fraction) phenyl-substituted 
methylpolysiloxane  phase  (0.25 µm  film  thickness)  (DB-5,  Agilent  Technologies,  Wilmington, DE)  and  a 
0.25 mm × 60 m fused silica capillary column with a non-polar proprietary phase (0.25 µm film thickness) (DB-XLB, 
Agilent Technologies).  For the GC-ECD analyses, two PCB congeners that are not significantly present in the blubber 
extract (PCB 103 and PCB 198 [4,5]), and endosulfan I-d4, 4,4'-DDE-d8, 4,4'-DDD-d8, and 4,4'-DDT-d8 were added 
to the blubber prior to extraction for use as internal standards for quantification purposes. 
 
GC/MS (I):    For  the  GC/MS (I)  analyses,  approximately  1.5 g  subsamples  from  six  bottles  of  SRM 1945  were 
extracted using PFE with DCM.  SEC with a preparative-scale divinylbenzene-polystyrene column (10 µm particle 
size with 100 Å diameter pores) was used to remove the high molecular mass compounds.  The analytes of interest 
were  then  further  isolated  using  a  silica  solid  phase  extraction (SPE)  column.    GC/MS  analyses  in  the  electron 
impact (EI) mode were performed on a 0.25 mm × 30 m fused silica capillary column with a 5 % phenyl-substituted 
methylpolysiloxane  phase  (0.25 µm  film  thickness)  (HP-5MS,  Agilent  Technologies).    PCB 103,  PCB 198,  and 
carbon-13 labeled 4,4'-DDE, 4,4'-DDT, lindane, and trans-nonachlor were added to the blubber prior to extraction for 
use as internal standards for quantification purposes. 
 
GC/MS (II):    For  the  GC/MS (II)  analyses,  approximately  4 g  subsamples  from  three  bottles  of  SRM 1945  were 
Soxhlet extracted using with 1:1 hexane:acetone (volume fraction) for approximately 20 h.  Concentrated sulfuric acid 
was used to remove the majority of the lipid and biogenic material.  The analytes of interest were then further isolated 
using a silica SPE column.  GC/MS analyses were performed on a 0.25 mm × 60 m fused silica capillary column with 
a non-polar proprietary phase (0.25 µm film thickness) (DB-XLB, Agilent Technologies) using two ionization modes, 
EI and negative chemical ionization (NCI).  PCB 103, PCB 198, and carbon-13 labeled 4,4'-DDT, lindane, PCB 28, 
PCB 101, PCB 118, PCB 138, PCB 153, and PCB 169 were added to the blubber prior to extraction for use as internal 
standards for quantification purposes. 
 
GC/MS (IIIa and IIIb):  For the GC/MS (III) analyses, two sets of samples were run using the same method.  One 
set included nine subsamples and the other set included six subsamples of SRM 1945 (approximately 1 g each) that 
were  extracted  using  PFE  with  DCM.    SEC  with  a  preparative-scale  divinylbenzene-polystyrene  column  (10 µm 
particle size with 100 Å diameter pores) was used to remove the high molecular mass compounds.  The concentrated 
extract  was  then  fractionated  on a semi-preparative aminopropylsilane column  to isolate  two  fractions containing:  
(1) the PCBs and lower polarity pesticides and, (2) the more polar pesticides.  GC/MS (EI) analyses were performed 
on a 0.25 mm × 60 m fused silica capillary column with a 5 % phenyl-substituted methylpolysiloxane phase (0.25 µm 
film  thickness)  (DB-5MS,  Agilent  Technologies).    PCB 103,  PCB 198,  4,4'-DDD-d8,  4,4'-DDT-d8,  and  carbon-13 
labeled cis-chlordane  were added to the blubber prior to extraction for use as internal standards for quantification 
purposes. 
 
GC/MS (IV):    For  the  GC/MS (IV)  analyses,  approximately  1 g  subsamples  from  six  bottles  of  SRM 1945  were 
extracted using PFE with DCM.  SEC with a preparative-scale divinylbenzene-polystyrene column (10 µm particle 
size with 100 Å diameter pores) was used to remove the high molecular mass compounds.  The analytes of interest 
were then further isolated using a silica SPE column.  GC/MS (EI) analyses were performed on a 0.25 mm × 60 m 
fused  silica  capillary  column  with  a  50 %  phenyl-substituted  methylpolysiloxane  phase  (0.25 µm  film  thickness) 
(DB-17MS,  Agilent  Technologies).    Carbon-13  labeled  4,4'-DDE,  4,4'-DDT,  lindane,  trans-nonachlor,  PCB 28, 
PCB 101, PCB 105, PCB 153, and PCB 170 and 4,4'-DDD-d8 were added to the blubber prior to extraction for use as 
internal standards for quantification purposes. 
 
GC/MS (V):    For  the  GC/MS (V)  analyses,  approximately  1 g  subsamples  from  three  bottles  of  SRM 1945  were 
extracted using PFE with DCM.  SEC with a the following series of columns (PhenoGel, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) 
was used to remove the high molecular mass compounds: guard column (50 mm × 7.80 mm i.d., 10 µm particle size), 
first  column  (600 mm  ×  21.2 mm i.d.,  10 µm  particle  size    and  100 Å  diameter  pores),  and  second  column 
(300 mm × 21.2 mm i.d., 10 µm particle size and 100 Å diameter pores).  The analytes of interest were then further 
isolated  using  an  alumina  SPE  column.    GC/MS  analyses  in  both  the  EI  and  NICI  mode  were  performed  on    a 
0.18 mm × 30 m fused silica capillary column with a non-polar proprietary phase (0.18 µm film thickness) (DB-XLB, 
Agilent  Technologies).    Carbon-13  labeled  PCB 28,  PCB 52,  PCB 77,  PCB 118,  PCB 126,  PCB 153,  PCB 169, 
PCB 180,  PCB 194,  PCB 206,  trans-chlordane,  BDE 99,  and  BDE 209  plus  endosulfan  I-d4,  4,4'-DDE-d8, 
4,4'-DDD-d8,  and  4,4'-DDT-d8  were  added  to  the  blubber  prior  to  extraction  for  use  as  internal  standards  for 
quantification purposes.

GC/MS (VI):  For the GC/MS (VI) analyses, approximately 1 g subsamples from three bottles of SRM 1945 were 
Soxhlet extracted using with DCM for approximately 20 h.  SEC with a preparative-scale divinylbenzene-polystyrene 
column (10 µm particle size with 100 Å diameter pores) was used to remove the high molecular mass compounds.  
The analytes of interest were then further isolated using a silica SPE column.  GC/MS (EI) analyses were performed 
on  a  0.25 mm°× 60 m  fused  silica  capillary  column  with  a  non-polar  proprietary  phase  (0.25 µm  film  thickness) 
(DB-XLB,  Agilent  Technologies).    Carbon-13  labeled  4,4'-DDE,  4,4'-DDT,  lindane,  trans-nonachlor,  PCB 28, 
PCB 101, PCB 105, PCB 153, and PCB 170 and 4,4'-DDD-d8 were added to the blubber prior to extraction for use as 
internal standards for quantification purposes. 
 
Non-ortho  PCBs:    The  reference  values  for  PCB 77,  PCB 126,  and  PCB 169  were  determined  from  a  separate 
fraction.  The samples were extracted and processed as for GC/MS (III) above.  The first (PCB and lower polarity 
pesticide) fraction from the semi-preparative aminopropylsilane column was further fractionated using a Cosmosil 
PYE column (5 µm particle size, 4.6 mm i.d. × 25 cm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA).  Three fractions were collected: 
the first fraction contained the pesticides and multi-ortho PCBs, the second fraction contained the polychlorinated 
naphthalenes, non-ortho PCB congeners, and some mono-ortho PCB congeners, and the third fraction removed the 
residual  planar  compounds  from  the  column.    The  second  fraction  was  analyzed  by  GC/MS  NICI  using  a 
0.25 mm × 60 m fused silica capillary column with a 5 % phenyl-substituted methylpolysiloxane phase (0.25 µm film 
thickness)  (DB-5MS,  Agilent  Technologies).    Carbon-13  labeled  PCB 77,  PCB 126,  and  PCB 169  were  used  as 
internal standards for quantification purposes. 
 
PBDEs  and  MeO-PBDEs  GC/MS(VII):    For  one  set  of  the  PBDE  analyses  and  for  the  MeO-PBDE  analyses, 
approximately one gram subsamples from five bottles of SRM 1945 were extracted using PFE with DCM.  SEC with 
a preparative-scale divinylbenzene polystyrene column (10 µm particle size with 100 Å diameter pores) was used to 
remove  the  high  molecular  mass  compounds.    GC/MS  analyses  in  both  the  EI  and  NICI  modes  were  performed  
on  a  0.25 mm × 15 m  fused  silica  capillary  column  with  a  5 %  phenyl-substituted  methylpolysiloxane  phase  
(0.25 µm  film  thickness)  (DB-5MS,  Agilent  Technologies).    Carbon-13  labeled  BDE  15,  BDE  209,  and 
2,2,3,4,5-pentachlorodiphenyl  ether (CDE-86)  were  added  to  the  blubber  prior  to  extraction  for  use  as  internal 
standards for quantification purposes. 
 
Interlaboratory Comparison Studies (IL):  In addition to the analyses performed at NIST, SRM 1945 was used in 
an interlaboratory comparison exercise in 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2003  as part of the NIST/NOAA Interlaboratory 
Comparison  Exercise  Program  for  Organic  Contaminants  in  the  Marine  Mammal  Tissues [6–8].    Results  from 
26 laboratories that participated in these exercises were used as the ninth data set in the determination of the certified 
values for PCB congeners, chlorinated pesticides, and PBDEs in SRM 1945.  The laboratories participating in these 
exercises  employed  the  analytical  procedures  routinely  used  in  their  laboratories  to  measure  PCB  congeners, 
chlorinated pesticides, and PBDEs. 
 
Non-volatile Extractable Mass Determination:  The percent of non-volatile extractable material (or total extractable 
organics)  was  determined  gravimetrically  for  the  nine  data  sets  described  above  for  the  determination  of  PCBs  and 
pesticides.  The percent non-volatile extractable material is 71.9 % ± 1.3 % (95 % confidence interval for the mean).

(a) PCB congeners are numbered according to the scheme proposed by Ballschmiter and Zell [4] and later revised by Schulte and 
and
Malisch [5] to conform with IUPAC rules.  For the specific congeners mentioned in this table, the Ballschmiter-Zell numbers 
correspond to those of Schulte and Malisch.  When two or more congeners are known to coelute under the GC analysis conditions 
used, the PCB congener listed first is the major component and the additional congeners may be present as minor components.  
The quantitative results are based on the response of the congener listed first. 

(b) Certified values are  weighted  means of the results  for up to nine data sets [9].  The uncertainty listed with each value is an 
expanded  uncertainty  about  the  mean,  with  coverage  factor  2  (approximately  95 %  confidence)  calculated  by  combining  a 
between-method variance incorporating inter-method bias with a pooled within-source variance following the ISO/JCGM and 
NIST Guides [10]. 

(c) GC-ECD analysis on dual columns, DB-5 and DB-XLB following PFE using DCM. 
(d) GC/MS(I) analysis on HP-5MS column following PFE using DCM. 
(e) GC/MS(II) analysis on DB-XLB column following Soxhlet extraction using 1:1 hexane:acetone (volume fraction). 
(f) GC/MS(IIIa) analysis on DB-5MS column following PFE using DCM. 
(g) GC/MS(IIIb) analysis on DB-5MS column following PFE using DCM. 
(h) GC/MS(IV) analysis on DB-17MS column following PFE using DCM. 
(i)  GC/MS(V) analysis on DB-XLB column following PFE using DCM. 
(j)  GC/MS(VI) analysis on DB-XLB column following Soxhlet extraction using DCM. 
(k) Combination of consensus means from four interlaboratory comparison exercises. 
(l)  Certified value is the unweighted mean of the results for three data sets.  The uncertainty listed with the value is an expanded 
uncertainty about the mean, with coverage factor 2, calculated by combining a between-method variance [11] with a pooled, 
within-method variance following the ISO/JCGM and NIST Guides [10].
