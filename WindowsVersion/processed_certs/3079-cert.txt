Aroclor 1254 in Transformer Oil 

or 

Aroclor 1254: 

3190 mg/L    139 mg/L 

3579 mg/kg    154 mg/kg  

 
This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM) 
is  a  solution  of  Aroclor 1254  (Chemical  Abstracts  Registry 
Number 11097-69-1)  in  transformer  oil.    This  SRM  is  intended  primarily  for  calibrating  chromatographic 
instrumentation  and  methods  of  analysis  used  for  the  determination  of  Aroclor 1254  and  polychlorinated 
biphenyls (PCBs)  in  transformer  oil.    A  unit  of  SRM 3079  consists  of  five  2 mL  ampoules,  each  containing 
approximately 1.2 mL of transformer oil. 
 
Certified  Concentration  of  Aroclor 1254:    The  certified  concentration [1,2]  given  below  is  based  on  results 
obtained  from  the  gravimetric  preparation  of  this  solution  and  from  the  analytical  results  determined  using  gas 
chromatography.  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in 
that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account. 
 
 
 
The  result  is  expressed  as  the  certified  value    the  expanded  uncertainty.    The  certified  value  is  the  unweighted 
average  of  the  concentrations  determined  by  gravimetric  and  gas  chromatographic  measurements.    The  expanded 
uncertainty, at the 95 % level of confidence, is calculated as U = kuc, where uc is a combined standard uncertainty 
calculated according to the ISO Guide [3] and k = 2 is the coverage factor.  The value of uc includes an allowance 
for differences between the concentration determined by gas chromatographic measurements for various sources of 
Aroclors  and  gravimetric  preparation.  The  concentration  expressed  in  mg/L  was  obtained  by  multiplying  the 
certified  value,  expressed  as  a  mass  fraction,  by  the  measured  density (22 °C)  of  the  SRM  solution, 
0.8912 g/mL  0.0205 g/mL,  where  0.0205  represents  one  standard  deviation (1s)  and  is  incorporated  in  the 
uncertainty associated with the concentration expressed in mg/L. 
 
Expiration  of  Certification:    The  certification  of  SRM 3079  is  valid,  within  the  measurement  uncertainty 
specified, until 31 July 2030, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given in 
this  certificate  (see  “Instructions  for  Handling,  Storage,  and  Use”).    However,  the  certification  is  nullified  if  the 
SRM is damaged, contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance  of  SRM  Certification:    NIST  will  monitor  this  SRM  over  the  period  of  its  certification.    If 
substantive changes occur that affect the certification before the expiration of this certificate, NIST will notify the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
The coordination of the technical measurements leading to the certification was under the direction of D.L. Poster 
and  M.M. Schantz  of  the  NIST  Analytical  Chemistry  Division.    Analytical  measurements  of  the  SRM  were 
performed by D.L. Poster. 
 
Partial support for the preparation and certification of this SRM was provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA)  Office  of  Water,  Office  of  Enforcement  and  Compliance  Assurance,  and  Office  of  Research  and 
Development. 
 
Preparation  of  the  SRM  was  performed  by  M.P. Cronise  of  the  NIST  Measurement  Services  Division  and 
D.L. Poster.

NOTICE AND WARNING TO USERS 
 
This  material  is  a  solution  of  a  PCB  mixture.    PCB-containing  materials  are  reported  to  be  toxic.    Consult  the 
Material  Safety  Data  Sheet (MSDS),  enclosed  with  the  SRM  shipment,  for  details.    Contact  your  regional  EPA 
office for information regarding proper disposal. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE AND USE 
 
Handling and Storage:  Extreme caution and care should be exercised during the handling of SRM 3079.  Sealed 
ampoules, as received, should be stored in the dark at temperatures lower than 30 °C. 
 
Use:  Sample aliquots for analysis should be withdrawn at 20 °C to 25 °C immediately after opening the ampoules 
and  should  be  processed  without  delay  for  the  certified  value  to  be  valid  within  the  stated  uncertainty.    Certified 
values are not applicable to material stored in ampoules that have been opened for more than 5 minutes, even if they 
are resealed. 
 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
The  Aroclor 1254  used  in  the  preparation  of  this  SRM  was  obtained  from  U.S. EPA.    The  SRM  was  prepared  at 
NIST by weighing and mixing Aroclor 1254 into transformer oil (Univolt 60, Exxon).  The Aroclor was added to 
the  transformer  oil  and  mixed  until  completely  dissolved  and  homogenized.    The  total  mass  of  this  solution  was 
measured and aliquots (1.2 mL) were dispensed into 2 mL amber glass ampoules, which were then flame sealed. 
 
Aliquots from nine ampoules, selected randomly, were analyzed using capillary gas chromatography with electron 
capture  detection  and  an  immobilized  non-polar  (5 %  phenyl  methylpolysiloxane)  stationary  phase  column.    An 
internal standard solution containing 2,4,5-trichlorobiphenyl and octachloronaphthalene was added to each sample 
for  quantification  purposes.    Prior  to  gas  chromatography,  samples  were  placed  on  aminopropyl  solid  phase 
extraction  columns  and  eluted  with  hexane.    The  concentrated  eluants  were  then  placed  on  a  semi-preparative 
aminopropylsilane column using hexane as the mobile phase.  Calibration solutions consisting of weighed amounts 
of  Aroclor 1254  and  internal  standard  compounds  in  transformer  oil  were  chromatographically  analyzed  to 
determine  response  factors  for  Aroclor 1254  relative  to  each  internal  standard.    The  results  for  Aroclor 1254  are 
based  on  the  areas  of  the  dominant  Aroclor  PCB  peaks  relative  to  the  internal  standard  peaks  (Figure 1).    This 
approach is similar to U.S. EPA Method 505 (Analysis of organohalide pesticides and commercial polychlorinated 
biphenyl products in water by microextraction and gas chromatography, revision 2.0).
