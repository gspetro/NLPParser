Certificate of Analysis 
Standard Reference Material® 330a 

 

 
Copper Ore Mill Heads 

 
This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  use  in  evaluating  chemical  and  instrumental 
methods of analysis as well as evaluating the accuracy of “material balance” measurements in the copper mining and 
metallurgical industries.  A unit of SRM 330a consists of one bottle containing approximately 90 g of powder. 
 
Certified  Mass  Fraction  Values:    Certified  values,  expressed  as  mass  fractions [1]  for  seven  elements  in 
SRM 330a are listed in Table 1.  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its 
accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [2].  Certified 
values  are  based  on  the  weighted  means  of  analyses  performed  at  NIST  and  collaborating  laboratories [3].    The 
uncertainty listed with each value is an expanded uncertainty based on a 95 % confidence interval and is calculated 
according to the methods in the ISO Guide and its Supplement 1 [4,5]. 
 
Reference  Mass  Fraction  Values:    Reference  values  for  fourteen  elements  are  provided  in  Table 2.    Reference 
values  are non-certified values that  are  the  present  best  estimates  of  the  true  values.    However,  the  values do not 
meet  the  NIST  criteria  for  certification  and  are  provided  with  associated  uncertainties  that  may  not  include  all 
sources  of  uncertainty.    Reference  values  are  based  on  the  weighted  means  of  analyses  performed  at  NIST  and 
collaborating  laboratories [3].  The  uncertainty  listed  with  each  value  is  an  expanded  uncertainty  based  on  a  95 % 
confidence interval and is calculated according to the methods in the ISO Guide and its Supplement 1 [4,5]. 
 
Information  Mass  Fraction  Values:    The  information  values  for  seven  elements  provided  in  Table 3  are 
noncertified values with no reported uncertainties.  A NIST information value is considered to be a value that will be 
of interest to the SRM user, but insufficient information is available to adequately the uncertainty associated with 
the value [2].   
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 330a is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until  31 December 2020,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  instructions  given  in  this 
certificate  (see  “Instructions  for  Use”).    The  certification  is  nullified  if  the  SRM  is  damaged,  contaminated,  or 
otherwise modified.  
 
Maintenance  of  SRM  Certification:    NIST  will  monitor  this  SRM  over  the  period  of  its  certification.    If 
substantive  technical  changes  occur  that affect  the  certification before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST will 
notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
The  coordination  of  the  technical  measurements  for  certification  of  this  SRM  was  under  the  direction  of 
R.D. Vocke, Jr. of the NIST Analytical Chemistry Division. 
 
Analytical measurements for certification of this SRM were performed by A.F. Marlow and J.R. Sieber of the NIST 
Analytical  Chemistry  Division.    Additional  measurements  were  provided  by  SGS  Minerals  Services,  Lakefield, 
Ontario, Canada and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Denver, CO under the direction of S.G. Wilson. 
 
Statistical consultation for this SRM was provided by R.C Hagwood of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division. 
 
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Measurement  Services 
Division.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 
 
To relate analytical determinations to the assigned values in this Certificate of Analysis, a minimum test portion of 
100 mg  is  recommended  on  the  basis  of  homogeneity  testing  performed  at  NIST  using  X-ray  fluorescence 
spectrometry.    The  powder  does  not  require  preparation  prior  to  weighing.    The  material  should  be  stored  in  its 
original container, tightly capped, in a cool, dry location.  Loss on drying was tested at 110 C for 2 h and found to 
be approximately 0.87 %.  
 
Material  Preparation  and  Analysis:1    The  material  for  SRM 330a  was  provided  by  C. Bucknam  of  Newmont 
Metallurgical Services, Englewood, CO.  The material was ground, blended, and bottled at the USGS, Denver, CO 
under the supervision of S.G. Wilson.  The material was characterized using the methods listed in Table 4.

(a) The  assigned  value  is  a  weighted  mean  of  the  results  from  two  sets  of  measurements  from  multiple  independent  analytical 

methods using the method of DerSimonian and Laird as described by Rukhin [3]. 

(b) The  uncertainty  listed  with  the  value  is  an  expanded  uncertainty  about  the  mean,  with  coverage  factor k,  calculated  by 

Monte-Carlo simulation of uncertainty components using methods from the ISO Guide and its Supplement 1 [4,5]. 

                                                 

1  Certain  commercial  equipment,  instruments,  or  materials  are  identified  in  this  certificate  to  adequately  specify  the 
experimental  procedure.    Such  identification  does  not  imply  recommendation  or  endorsement  by  the  National  Institute  of 
Standards and Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the 
purpose.
