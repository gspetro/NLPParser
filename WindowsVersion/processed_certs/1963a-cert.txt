particle  sizing  instruments, 
This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  intended  for  the  calibration/validation  of  particle  sizing  instruments, 
including electron microscopes, differential mobility analyzers, scanning surface inspection systems, and other light 
scattering  instruments.    A  unit  of  SRM 1963a  consists  of  5 mL  of  polystyrene  spheres  in  deionized  filtered 
(0.2 µm pore size) water.  The particle suspension contains primary spheres (monomers) with very few agglomerates.  
The spheres are present at a mass fraction of approximately 0.5 % and are supplied in a dispensing vial.  
 
The size probability distribution is P(D) = dN/dD, where dN is the fraction of particles with diameter between D and 
D + dD.  The modal diameter, which is the diameter where P(D) takes the largest value, also called the mode of P(D), 
was measured for the spheres suspended as an aerosol using differential mobility analysis (DMA) [1].  The certified 
value for the modal diameter of the polystyrene spheres as an aerosol is given in Table 1. 
 

Table 1.  Certified Modal Sphere Diameter and Expanded Uncertainty(a) 

 

Modal Diameter  

101.8 nm  ±  1.1 nm 

(a) The expanded uncertainty (95 % confidence interval) includes both Type A and Type B uncertainties calculated according to the 

ISO/JCGM Guide [2]. 

 
These results are based on three repeat measurements on each of three different dates.  There was one calibration 
measurement made either proceeding or following each of the certification measurements [3].  The measurand is the 
length,  expressed  as
diameter for the Modal Sphere.  The certified values are metrological traceable to the SI unit of length, expressed as 
nanometers. 
 
The value for the combined uncertainty for the modal diameter is 0.55 nm and the number of degrees of freedom for 
the uncertainty is 153.  This information may be used to estimate the uncertainty when using the spheres for calibrating 
a particle sizing instrument and estimating the effective degrees of freedom.  
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 1963a is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until 31 March 2022, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with instructions given in this certificate 
(see  “Instructions  for  Handling,  Storage  and  Use”).    This  certification  is  nullified  if  the  SRM  is  damaged, 
contaminated, or otherwise modified.  
 
Maintenance  of  Certification:    NIST  will  monitor  this  SRM  over  the  period  of  its  certification.    If  substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification.

Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Office  of  Reference 
Materials. 
 
Traceability:    In  the  present  certification  measurements [1],  the  DMA  was  calibrated  using  SRM 1963.    The 
certification of SRM 1963 [4] was based upon the certification of the 0.895 µm particle standard, SRM 1690.  The 
certification of SRM 1690 [5], in turn, was based upon the He-Ne laser wavelength in air, 632.807 nm.  Lastly, the 
He-Ne laser wavelength [6] has been determined with respect to the fundamental standard, SI Unit for length.  All of 
the contributions to the uncertainty imposed by this traceability chain have been included in the Type B uncertainty 
expressed above. 
 
Information Values:  An information value is considered to be a value that will be of interest to the SRM user, but 
insufficient information is available to assess the uncertainty associated with the value.  Information values cannot be 
used to establish metrological traceability. 
 
Additional Information:  A single measurement of the size probability distribution P(D) over an extended range of 
the  distribution  is  given  in Table 2  and  Figure  1.    The  standard deviation of  the  size distribution near  the  peak  is 
2.5 nm, and the standard deviation of the entire distribution is 4.0 nm.  The number median diameter is 101.1 nm.  The 
number median diameter is the diameter x, at which the integral

where the cumulative distribution function is 0.5.  The number mean diameter, the volume mean diameter, the light 
scattering  mean  diameter,  and  the  dynamic  light  scattering  mean  diameter  are  given  in  Table 3.    The  extended 
measurement of P(D) yielded a slightly different modal diameter than the certified value, because that measurement 
was only obtained from a single scan on a single day; the difference between those values is statistically insignificant.  
These are non-certified values with no uncertainty assessed and are provided for information purposes only.

The peak diameter is for the spheres as an aerosol.  The contaminants in the suspension result in a residue layer on the 
spheres.  The estimated thickness of this layer is 0.30 nm. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE  
 
Handling and Use:  A sample of the spheres may be obtained by squeezing a drop from the vial.  Use filtered (0.2 µm 
pore size filter) deionized water for dilution.  Care should be exercised to prevent contamination once the cap has been 
removed. 
 
Storage:  Refrigerate the sample (5 °C to 15 °C) but DO NOT allow the sample to become frozen.  DO NOT remove 
the cap from the vial until the sample is used.  It should be noted that no biocide was added during packaging.  Once 
the sample is opened, there is a possibility of biological contamination leading to growth of bacteria or spores.  To 
minimize the occurrence of this unwanted growth, replace the cap immediately after dispensing the sample drops.  
 
Note:  The polystyrene spheres may be damaged by exposure to an electron beam.  This effect can be minimized by 
using a short exposure time and low electron flux [7].
