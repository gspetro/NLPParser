Standard  Reference  Material  2286 

Ethanol  in  Reference  Gasoline 
(Nominal  2.0  Weight  Percent  Oxygen) 

This  Standard  Reference  Material  (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  use  as  a  primary  standard  for  the  calibration  of 
instruments  used  for  the  determination  of  the  oxygen  content  of  motor  fuels. 
It  consists  of  a  solution  of  ethanol  (Chemical 
Abstracts  Service  (CAS)  Registry  Number  64-17-5)  in  a  reference  gasoline.  Certified  concentrations  are  provided  for 
ethanol  and  oxygen.  A  unit  of  SRM  2286  consists  of  two  20  mL  ampoules  of  the  ethanol  in  reference  gasoline  solution, 
each  containing  approximately  18  mL,  and  one  20  mL  ampoule  containing  approximately  18  mL  of  the  reference  gasoline, 
intended  for  use  as  a  measurement  blank. 

Certified  Concentrations:  The  certified  concentrations  and  estimated  uncertainties  for  ethanol  and  oxygen  are  given 
below.  These  concentrations  are  based  on  results  obtained  from  the  gravimetric  preparation  of  the  solution  of  ethanol 
in  gasoline  and  from  the  analytical  results  determined  using  gas  chromatography,  corrected  for  impurities.

Uncertainty:  The  uncertainty  of  each  value  in  this  document  is  the  numerical  value  of  an  expanded  uncertainty  U  =  ku, 
k  =  2.  The  expanded  uncertainty 
with  U  determined  from  a  combined  standard  uncertainty  u,  and  a  coverage  factor, 
defines  a  range  of  values  for  the  certified  value  within  which  the  true  value  is  believed  to  lie,  at  a  level  of  confidence  of 
95%  [1]. 

NOTICE  AND  WARNING  TO  USERS 

Handling  and  Storage:  Provide  local  exhaust  or  general  dilution  ventilation  to  meet  published  exposure  limits.  Those

Protect  ampoules  from  physical  damage. 
Please  read  the  MSDS  for  this  material  before  use. 

Analytical  determinations  were  performed  by  S.N.  Chesler  and  T.L.  Green  of  the  NIST  Analytical  Chemistry  Division.  The 
S.N.  Chesler  and  F.R.  Guenther 
coordination  of the  technical  measurements  leading  to  certification  was  under  the  direction  of 
of  the  NIST  Analytical  Chemistry  Division.  Data  analysis  was  provided  by  D.  Duewer  of  the  NIST  Analytical  Chemistry 
Division  and  reviewed  by  K.  Eberhart  of  the  NIST  Statistical  Engineering  Division. 

The  technical  and  support  aspects  involved  in  the  preparation,  certification,  and  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated 
through  the  Standard  Reference  Materials  Program  by  T.E.  Gills  and  J.S.  Kane.

Expiration  of  Certification: 
5  years  from  the  date  of 
shipment  from  NIST.  In  the  event  that  the  certification  should  become  invalid  before  then,  purchasers  will  be  notified 
by  NIST.  Please  return  the  attached  registration  card  to  facilitate  notification. 

The  certified  values  are  valid,  within  the  limits  specified,  for 

| 

Use:  Sample  aliquots  for  analysis  should  be  withdrawn  at  20  to  25  °C  immediately  after  opening  the  ampoules  and  should 
be  processed  without  delay  for  the  certified  values  to  be  valid  within  the  stated  uncertainty.  Because  of  the  volatility  of 
some  of  the  components  in  the  reference  gasoline,  certified  values  are  not  applicable  to  material  stored  in  ampoules  that 
have  been  opened  for  more  than  5  min,  even  if  they  are  resealed. 

Preparation  and  Gravimetric  Analysis:  This  SRM  was  prepared  by  G.  Lew  of  Scott  Specialty  Gases  Inc.  at  Scott’s 
facilities  in  Houston,  TX.  All  chemicals  used  in  the  preparation  of  this  material  were  obtained  from  commercial  sources. 
The  reference  gasoline  was  obtained  from  Phillips  Petroleum,  Bartlesville,  OK  and  was  identified  as  RF-A.  Reagent 
Grade  ethanol  was  obtained  from  South  Point  Ethanol,  South  Point,  OH. 

This  SRM  was  prepared  by  additive  weighing  of  the  RF-A  gasoline  and  ethanol.  After  preparation  and  homogenization, 
the  solution  was  aliquoted  into  20  mL  glass  ampoules  which  were  subsequently  flame  sealed.  The  gravimetrically 
determined  concentration  of  ethanol  in  the  SRM  solution  was  (5.77  +  0.02)  g/100  g  solution. 

The  concentration  of  the  ethanol  in  the  SRM  solution  was  determined  by  capillary 
Gas  Chromatographic  Analysis: 
column  gas  chromatography  using  flame  ionization  detection  (GC-FID).  Analysis  was  based  upon  the  ratio  of  the  elution 
peak  area  of  ethanol  and  that  of  a  gasoline  component.  The  gasoline  component  selected  had  a  large,  well  resolved  peak 
with  a  similar  retention  time  to  ethanol. 
Ethanol  solution  concentration  was  calculated  from  a  calibration  curve 
constructed  from  peak  area  ratios  for  unmodified  RF-A  gasoline  blank  and  NIST  gravimetrically  prepared  standards.  This 
concentration  of  ethanol  in  the  SRM  solution  was  (5.76  +  0.04)  g/100  g  solution. 

The  organic  purity  of  the  ethanol  was  also  determined  using  GC-FID.  Based  on  12  replicate  analyses,  it  was  determined 
to  be  (99.94  +  0.02)%. 

The  water  concentration  of  the  SRM  solution  was  determined  by  capillary  column  gas  chromatography  using  atomic  emission 
detection  (GC-AED)  in  oxygen-specific  mode.  Based  on 3  replicate  analyses,  it  was  determined  to  be  (0.02  +  0.01)  2/100  g 
SRM  solution.  The  concentration  of  oxygen  from  trace  organic  impurities  was  also  determined  using  GC-AED.  No 
significant  oxygen-containing  impurities  other  than  water  were  found  in  this  SRM. 

The  ethanol  content  in  the  SRM  solution  was  calculated  from  the  consensus  concentration  of  ethanol  in  the  SRM  solution, 
with  corrections  for  both  water  and  organic  purity.  The  molecular  oxygen  content  in  the  SRM  was  calculated  from  the 
sum  of  the  corrected  ethanol  concentration  and  water  concentration.
