Refractive  Index  Glass 

This  standard  was  prepared  from  a  selected  portion  of  a  commercial  borosilicate  glass!  11  that is 
is  designed  for  both  the  calibration  of 
homogeneous,  stable,  and  has  a  high  optical  quality.  It 
refractometers  and  the  determination  of  refractive  indexes  of  microscope  immersion  liquids.  The 
standard  consists  of  two  rectangular  slabs:  a  slab  which is  polished  on  two  faces,  intended  for 
checking  the  performance  of  refractometers;  and  an  unpolished  slab,  which  can  be  broken  into 
fragments,  intended  for  microscopic  determination  of  the  refractive  indexes  of immersion  liquids.

The  research  and  technical  measurements  leading  to  the  certification  were  performed  in  the 
Optical  Physics  Division  of  the  National  Bureau  of  Standards  by  I.  H.  Malitson,  assisted  by  M.  J. 
Dodge,  J.  Cooke  and  J.  M.  Guyton. 

The  development  of  this  Standard  Reference  Material  was  sponsored  by  the  National  Institute  of 
Law  Enforcement  and  Criminal  Justice,  Law  Enforcement  Assistance  Administration,  U.S.  Depart- 
ment  of  Justice,  through  the  NBS  Law  Enforcement  Standards  Laboratory.  It  was  coordinated 
through  the  Office  of  Standard  Reference  Materials  by  C.  L.  Stanley.

The  homogeneity  of  the  glass  was  established  by  measuring  the  refractive  index  of  contiguous 
rectangular  slabs  and  prisms  that  were  cut  from  bars  of  glass.  The  prisms  were  used  to  determine 
refractive  index  at  13  wavelengths.  These  indexes  were  measured  by  the  classical  minimum  devia- 

homogeneity  of  this  glass,  it  is  believed  that  the  index  variance  at  the  other  wavelengths  is  within 
the  stated  uncertainty.  All  refractive  index  measurements  were  carried  out  in  a  temperature  con- 
trolled  laboratory--the  temperature  varied  not  more  than  0.3  °C.  The  values  of  refractive  index  are 
referred  to  20  °C  and  a  pressure  of  101,325  pascals  (760  mm  Hg).
