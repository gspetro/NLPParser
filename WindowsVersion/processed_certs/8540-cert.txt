Reference Material 8540 
 
IAEA-CH-7 
 
(Carbon and Hydrogen Isotopes in Polyethylene Foil) 

 
This  Reference  Material (RM)  is  intended  for  use  in  developing  and  validating  methods  for  measuring  relative 
differences in carbon (C) isotope-number ratios, R(13C/12C), and hydrogen (H) isotope-number ratios, R(2H/1H) [1].  
Even though the values for this RM are reference values and not certified [2], its use will improve the comparability 
of data from different laboratories.    The equivalent name  for this RM as used by the  International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA)  and  the  U.S. Geological  Survey (USGS)  is  IAEA-CH-7.    This  RM  was  formerly  also  called 
PEF-1 (PEF – Polyethylene Foil).  A unit of RM 8540 consists of approximately 3.5 g of polyethylene foil.

measurement precision and may not include all sources of uncertainty [2]. 

(b)  IAEA-CH-7 is also formerly known as PEF-1. 
(c)  The δ13C value is expressed as a mean and an expanded uncertainty.  An expanded uncertainty is equal to U = kuc, where uc is 
the combined standard uncertainty as defined by the ISO Guide [3] and k is the coverage factor. The value of the consensus 
mean  and  the  associated  combined  standard  uncertainty  were  calculated  using  a  multivariate  Bayesian  approach [4].    The 
combined  standard  uncertainty  is  intended  to  represent,  at  the  level  of  one  standard  deviation,  the  combined  effects  of 
uncertainty sources evaluated by both Type A and B methods.  Uncertainty in the bias of the methods is not included.  The 
coverage  factor,  k = 2,  provides  an  expanded  uncertainty  interval  that  has  about  a  95 %  probability  of  encompassing  the 
consensus  mean.    The  δ13C  value  and  expanded  uncertainty  are  taken  from  Table  S-4 (Supporting  Info) [4].  (VPDB -
 Vienna Peedee belemnite; LSVEC – Li Svec [named for H. Svec, formerly of Ames Laboratory, Iowa]) 

(d)  The δ2H value is expressed as a mean and an expanded uncertainty.  The expanded uncertainty is equal to U = kuc, where uc 
is the combined standard uncertainty as defined by the ISO Guide [3] and k is the coverage factor.   The combined standard 
uncertainty is intended to represent, at the level of one standard deviation, the effect of random errors on the reference value 
that  were  evaluated  by  statistical  means  (Type A).    Any  uncertainty  due  to  biases  in  the  methods  is  not  included  in  the 
expanded uncertainty.  The coverage factor for the δ2H value, k = 2.571 (n=6), provides an expanded uncertainty interval that 
has about a 95 % probability of encompassing the mean.  The δ2H value and uncertainty are taken from data in reference 5 
(VSMOW – Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water; SLAP-Standard Light Antarctic Precipitation). 

Expiration  of  Reference  Values:    RM 8540  is  valid,  within  the  measurement  uncertainty  specified,  until 
31 December 2020, provided the RM is handled and stored in accordance with instructions given in this Report of 
Investigation (see Instructions for Handling and Use).  This report is nullified if the RM is damaged, contaminated, 
or otherwise modified. 

Maintenance of RM:  NIST will  monitor this RM over the period of its  validity.  If substantive technical changes 
occur  that  affect  the  value  assignment  before  the  expiration  of  this  report,  NIST  will  notify  the  purchaser.  
Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification.

Materials. 
 
Reference Difference in Isotope-Number Ratio Values:  The differences in measured isotope-number ratios of 
stable  carbon  isotopes  in  substance  P,  R(13C/12C)P  =  [N (13C)P/ N (12C)P],  are  reported  as  δ13C  values [6].    The 
differences 
substance  P, 
R(2H/1H)P = [N (2H)P/ N (1H)P], are reported as δ2H values [6].  The relative differences in isotope-number ratios for 
carbon are referenced to VPDB while those for hydrogen are referenced to VSMOW, where:

δ13C = [R(13C/12C)sample / R(13C/12C)VPDB-LSVEC] – 1 

δ2H = [R (2H/1H)sample / R (2H/1H)VSMOW-SLAP] – 1 

 
VPDB-LSVEC refers to the Vienna PDB-LSVEC scale  which is defined by assigning a δ13C  value of +1.95 ‰ to 
NBS 19 (RM 8544)  and  a  consensus  value  of  –46.6 ‰  to  LSVEC (RM 8545) [7]  for  the  purpose  of  normalizing 
stable carbon isotopic measurements (see Normalization [6,7]).  The symbol ‰ is part per thousand and is equal to 
0.001. 
VSMOW-SLAP  refers  to  the  Vienna  SMOW-SLAP  scale  which  is  defined  by  assigning  a  δ2H  value  of 0  to 
VSMOW2 (RM 8535a) and a value of –428 ‰ to measurements of SLAP (RM 8537) or –427.5 ‰ to measurements 
of SLAP2 (RM 8537a) [9] for the purpose of normalizing stable hydrogen isotope measurements (see Normalization 
[8,9]). The symbol ‰ is part per thousand and is equal to 0.001. 

INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Handling and Storage:  RM 8540 (IAEA-CH-7) is stable at normal room temperatures. 

 
Distribution:  The distribution of RM 8540 (IAEA-CH-7) is limited to one unit per customer per three-year period 
of time. 
 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS 

Sample Preparation:  RM 8540 (IAEA-CH-7) was prepared by H. Gerstenberger and M. Herrmann, Zentralinstitut 
für Isotopen und Strahlenforschung, Leipzig, Germany [10,11]. 
 
Analytical  Methods:    The  δ13C  value  and  expanded  uncertainty  reported  in  Table 1  are  taken  from  results  of  an 
inter-laboratory  study  involving  a  two  point  calibration [4].    Results  from  four  expert  laboratories  (Centrum  voor 
Isotopen  Onderzoek,  Rijksuniversiteit  Groningen,  Groningen,  Netherlands;  Max-Planck-Institute 
for 
Biogeochemistry, Jena, Germany; UFZ [Umweltforschungszentrum] Leipzig-Halle GmbH, Leipzig, Germany; U.S. 
Geological  Survey,  Reston, Virginia, USA)  using  continuous  flow  elemental-analyzer 
isotope-ratio  mass 
spectrometry  and  following  the  general  method  of  Qi  et  al. [12]  were  combined  using  a  multivariate  Bayesian 
approach for data reduction [4]. 
The  δ2H  values  were  measured  by  six  different  laboratories,  normalized  to  yield  a  value  of  –428 ‰  for 
RM 8537 (SLAP)  and  reported  at  the  1993  IAEA  Consultants’  Group  Meeting  on  Stable  Isotope  Reference 
Samples [5]. 
The δ13C and δ2H values and expanded uncertainties reported in Table 1 for RM 8540 (IAEA-CH-7) are the values 
accepted by the Commission on Isotopic  Abundances  and  Atomic Weights of the  International Union of Pure and 
Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) (http://ciaaw.org/Carbon.htm and http://ciaaw.org/Hydrogen.htm, respectively) for this 
RM as of the date of this report. 
 
Isotopic  Homogeneity:    Data  from  the  inter-laboratory  comparisons  of  IAEA-CH-7  suggest  that  there  is  no 
evidence of carbon or hydrogen isotopic heterogeneity.

Normalization:  The δ13C values in samples should be normalized to the VPTB-LSVEC δ-scale by calibrating the 
measurement  with  respect  to  the  δ-value  for  NBS 19 (RM 8544)  and  the  δ-value  for  LSVEC (RM 8545),  the 
13C-depleted anchor RM [6,7].  A general formula for normalizing measured carbon isotope-number ratios using two 
laboratory standards LS1 (NBS 19) and LS2 (LSVEC) can be expressed as:

Note:  In the formulae above, cal denotes calibrated measurements made versus the VPDB scale, and  δ13C  LS1,cal and δ13C  LS2,cal 
are  the  conventionally  fixed  δ13C  values  for  NBS 19  and  LSVEC.    WS  denotes  measurements  made  versus  a  transfer 
gas (working standard), and δ13C LS1,WS and δ13CLS2,WS are the δ13C values for calibrated laboratory working standards. 
Similar  formulae  are  used  for  normalizing  δ2H  values  in  samples  to  the  VSMOW-SLAP  scale  where  LS1  is 
VSMOW2 and LS2 is SLAP or SLAP2 [8,9]. 
Please note that the reporting scale for δ2H is still denoted and referred to as the VSMOW-SLAP scale in spite of the 
exhaustion  of the  original  supply  of  VSMOW  and SLAP [13].    Of  course,  the  combined  standard  uncertainties  of 
VSMOW2 and SLAP2 isotopic values have to be included in any uncertainty budget.

LS1,

Reporting  of Stable  Isotope  δ  values:   The  following  recommendations  from  IUPAC  are  provided  for  reporting 
δ13C and δ2H values [6-9].  It is recommended that: 

 

 

δ13C values of all carbon-bearing substances be measured and expressed relative to VPDB on a normalized 
scale where LSVEC has a consensus value of –46.6 ‰ and NBS 19 has a value of +1.95 ‰;  
δ2H  values of  all hydrogen-bearing substances be  expressed relative to VSMOW-SLAP on a scale  where 
SLAP or SLAP2 has a consensus  value of –428 ‰ or –427.5 ‰, respectively  and VSMOW2 has a  value 
of 0; 

  Authors should clearly state that their data have been normalized.  

In  addition,  researchers  are  encouraged  to  report  the  isotopic  compositions  of  RM 8539 (NBS22)  and  other 
internationally distributed carbon or hydrogen isotopic reference  materials [14] in their publications, as appropriate 
to the method, as though they have been interspersed among unknowns. 

Current Reports of Investigation (ROI) for all light stable isotopic RMs mentioned in this report are available on the 
SRM web site [15].
