Standard  Reference  Material  620 

Soda-Lime  Flat  Glass 

(In  Cooperation  with  the  American  Society  for  Testing  and  Materials) 

This  Standard  Reterence  Material  is  for  use  in  checking  chemical  methods  of  analysis  and  for  calibration  in  optical 
emission  and  x-ray  spectrometric  methods  of  analysis.

The  certified  values  are  the  present  best  estimates  of  the  “true”  values  based  on  the  results  of  a  cooperative  analytical 
program. 
At  NBS,  fifteen  statistically  selected  samples  of  the  glass  were  extensively  tested  for  homogeneity  by 
S.  D.  Rasberry  and  C.  K.  Kim  using  x-ray  fluorescence  spectrometry.  Based  on  their  results  the  variations  within  and 
among  samples  are  estimated  to  be  less  than  the  uncertainties  given  above. 

The  overall  direction  and  coordination  of  the  round-robin  analysis  leading  to  certification  were  performed  by 
Paul  Close,  Chairman  of  ASTM  Subcommittee  C  14.02  on  Chemical  Analysis  of  Glass  and  Glass  Products. 

The  technical.and  support  aspects  involved  in  the  preparation,  certification,  and  issuance  of  this  Standard  Reference 
Material  were  coordinated  through  the  Office  of  Standard  Reference  Materials  by  G.  W.  Cleek  and  R.  E.  Michaelis.
