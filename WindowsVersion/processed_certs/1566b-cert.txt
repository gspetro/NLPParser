Certificate of Analysis 
Standard Reference Material® 1566b 

 

 
Oyster Tissue 

 
This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  use  in  evaluating  analytical  methods  and 
instruments used for  the determination  of  the  mass  fraction values of  selected  elements  and  proximates  in  marine 
bivalve tissue, foods, or similar materials.  A unit of SRM 1566b contains approximately 25 g of freeze-dried oyster 
tissue. 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values of Constituent Elements:  Certified values for elements and for methylmercury are 
provided in Table 1.  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in 
that all known or suspected sources of bias have been fully investigated or taken into account [1]. 
 
Reference Mass Fraction Values:  Reference values for elemental mass fractions are provided in Table 2.  Reference 
values  for  selected  proximates,  nitrogen,  and  total  dietary  fiber  are  provided  in  Table 3.    Reference  values  are 
noncertified values that are the best estimates of the true values; however, the values do not meet NIST criteria for 
certification [1].  Such values are provided with associated uncertainties that may reflect only measurement precision, 
may not include all sources of uncertainty, or may reflect a lack of sufficient statistical agreement among multiple 
analytical methods. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 1566b is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until 01 June 2030, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with instructions given in this certificate 
(see  “Instructions  for  Storage  and  Use”).    The  certification  is  nullified  if  the  SRM  is  damaged,  contaminated,  or 
otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Coordination  of  the  technical  measurements  was  performed  by  R.R. Greenberg,  D.J. O’Kelly,  S.A. Rabb 
K.E. Sharpless and S.A. Wise of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division. 
 
Preparation of the oyster tissue material was performed by B.J. Porter of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division and 
M.P. Cronise, C.N. Fales, and D.G. Friend of the NIST Office of Reference Materials. 
 
Statistical analysis of the data was performed by N.A. Heckert, H.-K. Liu, J.H. Yen, L.M. Gill, and M.S. Levenson of 
the NIST Statistical Engineering Division. 
 
The NIST analysts and collaborating laboratories that participated in the characterization of this SRM are listed 
in Appendix A. 
 
Support  aspects  involved  with  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Office  of  Reference 
Materials.

NOTICE AND WARNINGS TO USERS 
 
SRM 1566B IS INTENDED FOR RESEARCH USE; NOT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE AND USE 
 
Storage:  The material should be kept in its original bottle, tightly closed, and stored in a desiccator over magnesium 
perchlorate, Mg(ClO4)2, at temperatures between 10 °C to 30 °C.  It should NOT be exposed to intense sources of 
radiation, including ultraviolet light or sunlight. 
 
Use:  A minimum sample mass of 250 mg of material is necessary for values in this certificate to be valid within stated 
uncertainties.  This amount of material should be on a dry-mass basis (see “Instructions for Drying”).  The contents 
of the bottle should be shaken well before each use, and the bottle should be closed tightly immediately after use and 
stored as described above. 
 
Instructions for Drying:  Prior to removal of test portions for elemental analysis, the contents of the bottle should be 
thoroughly mixed.  Before the mass determination, samples of SRM 1566b must be dried to constant mass by one of 
the following procedures: 
 

1.  Drying at room temperature for at least 5 d over Mg(ClO4)2 in a desiccator. 
2.  Vacuum  drying  at  room  temperature  for  at  least  24 h  at  a  pressure  of  approximately  30 Pa 
at  least 

(0.2 mm Hg) using a cold trap. 

3.  Freeze drying for at least 5 d at a pressure of approximately 30 Pa (0.2 mm Hg). 

 
The analyst should ascertain that the material has indeed reached constant mass.  Although the above procedures have 
been generally sufficient, in a few instances the time needed to reach constant mass was longer than listed above.  If 
the constituents of interest are volatile, a separate test portion of the oyster tissue should be removed from the bottle 
at the time of analysis and dried to determine the mass fraction values on a dry-mass basis. 
 
SOURCE, PREPARATION, AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Source and Preparation of Material:  The oysters (Crassostrea virginica, an American Eastern oyster) used for the 
preparation  of SRM 1566b were purchased from  Bon Secour Fisheries, Inc. (Bon Secour, AL).   The  oysters were 
collected  from  the  Gulf  of  Mexico,  shucked,  rinsed  twice  to  remove  sediment  and  shells,  packed  and  sealed  in 
polyethylene bags, and frozen.  The frozen oysters and fluids were shipped in coolers containing dry ice to NIST.  At 
NIST, the oysters and fluids were ground in a Robot-Coupe Vertical Cutter Mixer that was equipped with a stainless 
steel bowl and titanium blades.  The oyster tissue was blended for 100 s into a slurry; approximately 5 kg of slurry 
was poured into each of 40 specially cleaned aluminum trays outfitted with temperature probes, and frozen at –20 °C.  
The  trays  were  taken  to  a  large  freeze-drying  facility  at  the  Frederick  Cancer  Research  and  Development  Center, 
Natural Products Group in Frederick, MD.  The freeze-dryer’s initial temperature was –45 °C and gradually increased 
to a temperature of 10 °C over a period of five days.  The freeze-dried material was stored at –20 °C, then broken into 
smaller pieces, blended in the Robot-Coupe Mixer, jet milled, and homogenized in a V-blender for 30 min to 40 min.  
The material was radiation sterilized (60Co) at Neutron Products, Inc. (Dickerson, MD), for approximately 5 h to an 
absorbed dose of 30 kGy and then aliquoted into amber bottles. 
 
Description of Calculations Used in Certified Value Assignment 
 
Sulfur:    The  certified  mass  fraction  value  of  sulfur  is  the  result  of  a  single  NIST  method,  thermal  ionization  mass 
spectrometry (TIMS), with confirmation by a second NIST method, prompt gamma activation analysis (PGAA).  Its 
uncertainty is expressed as an expanded uncertainty, U, and is calculated as U = kuc.  The quantity uc is the combined 
standard uncertainty,  calculated  according  to  the JCGM Guide [2],  that  accounts for  the  combined  components of 
uncertainty  for  the  method  at  one  standard  deviation.    The  coverage  factor,  k,  is  determined  from  the  Student’s 
t-distribution  corresponding  to  five  degrees  of  freedom  and  a  95 %  confidence.    Because  of  heterogeneity,  the 
uncertainty associated with sulfur takes the form of a prediction interval. 
 
Methylmercury:  The results for methylmercury are expressed as milligrams per kilogram as mercury.  The certified 
value  is  the  mean  of  results  from  four  different  laboratory  analyses  of  SRM 1566b  using  four  different  analytical 
methods.    The  expanded  uncertainty  in  the  certified  value  is  equal  to  U = kuc where  uc is  the  combined  standard 
uncertainty calculated according to the JCGM Guide [2] and k is the coverage factor.  The value uc is intended to 
represent, at the level of one standard deviation, the combined effect of all the uncertainties in the certified value.  
                                                           

certificate  to  adequately  specify  the  experimental
(1)Certain commercial equipment, instruments or materials are identified in this certificate to adequately specify the experimental 
procedure.    Such  identification  does  not  imply  recommendation  or  endorsement  by  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and 
Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the purpose.

verage  factor,  k 

Here, uc is given by the standard error of the mean of the four analyses.  The coverage factor, k, is determined from 
the Student’s t-distribution corresponding to three degrees of freedom and 95 % confidence. 
 
All Other Elements:  All other certified mass fraction values are weighted means of results from two or more analytical 
methods.  For these certified values, the uncertainty is calculated as U = kuc + B.  The quantity uc is the combined standard 
uncertainty calculated according to the JCGM Guide [2], which accounts for the combined effect of the within variance 
for  all  methods  at  one  standard  deviation.    The  coverage  factor,  k,  is  determined  from  the  Student’s  t-distribution 
corresponding to the appropriate associated degrees of freedom and 95 % confidence for each element.  The term B is a 
bias adjustment for the difference between methods, which is the maximum difference between the certified value and 
the method means [3].  Because of heterogeneity, the uncertainty associated with calcium and thorium takes the form of 
a prediction interval.

Reference Mass Fraction Values of Selected Proximates, Nitrogen, and Total Dietary Fiber:  Each reference value, 
expressed as a mass fraction of the material on an as-received or dry-mass basis, for a stated measurand is an equally 
weighted mean of results from the collaborating laboratories listed in Appendix A.  Each of four laboratories analyzed 
one portion from each of three bottles of SRM 1566b using their routine methods.  Determinations were performed on 
the material “as-received,” with conversion of results to a dry-mass basis using moisture values determined by the four 
laboratories on separate subsamples  taken from each of the three bottles.   The uncertainty in  the reference values  is 
expressed as an expanded uncertainty, U, at the 95 % level of confidence, and is calculated according to the method 
described in the JCGM Guide [2].  The expanded uncertainty is calculated as U = kuc, where uc is intended to represent, 
at the level of one standard deviation, the combined effect of between-laboratory and within-laboratory components of 
uncertainty.  The coverage factor, k, is determined from the Student’s t-distribution corresponding to the appropriate 
associated degrees of freedom and 95 % confidence for each analyte.  Analytical methodology information is provided 
in Table 4.  The measurands are the constituents listed in Table 3 as determined by the methods used by the laboratories.  
Metrological traceability is to the SI derived unit for mass fraction (expressed as-received and dry-mass basis as percent), 
as realized by the method used.
