Standard  Reference  Material  1587 

Nitrated  Polycyclic  Aromatic  Hydrocarbons  in  Methanol 

This  Standard  Reference  Material  (SRM)  consists  of  four  vials,  each  containing  approximately  1  mL-of  a  methanol 
solution  of  seven  nitrated  polycyclic  aromatic  hydrocarbons  (N-PAH).  SRM  1587  is  intended  primarily  for  use  in  cali- 
brating  chromatographic  instrumentation  used  for  the  determination  of  N-PAH  but  can  also  be  used  to  add  known 
amounts  of  these  compounds  to  methylene  chloride  extracts. 

Certified  Concentrations  of  N-PAH 
Certified  concentrations  of  the  seven  N-PAH  in  SRM  1587  are  given  in  Table  1.  The  concentration  values  are  certified 
in  4g/g  units  but  are  also  reported  in  ng/mL  units  for  user  convenience.  The  certified  values  in  Table  |  are  derived  from 
the  concordant  results  obtained  from  high-performance  liquid  chromatography  (HPLC)  and  gas  chromatography  (GC). 
These  data  are  given  in  Table  2,  The  N-PAH  used  in  the  preparation  of this  SRM  were  obtained  from  Midwest  Research 
Institute,  Kansas  City,  MO,  where  they  were  synthesized  under  contract  from  the  Coordinating  Research  Council,  Inc., 
Atlanta,  GA.  Compound  purities  were  determined  at  Midwest  Research  Institute. 
Each  compound  was  at  least 
99  percent  pure  and,  therefore,  no  correction  was  made  for  purity. 

NOTICE  AND  WARNINGS  TO  USERS 
Expiration  of  Certification:  This  certification  is  valid,  within  the  limits  certified,  for  one  year  from  the  date  of  purchase. 
In  the  event  that  the  certification  should  become  invalid  before  then,  purchasers  will  be  notified  by  NBS. 

Storage:  Sealed  ampoules,  as  received,  must  be  stored  in  the  dark  at  temperatures  between  —25  and'0  °C. 

Use:  Prior  to  use,  samples  for  analysis  should  be  brought  to  room  temperature,  equilibrated  for  one  hour  and  ultra- 
sonically  vibrated  for  about  30  seconds,  to  ensure  complete  solubility  of  the  compounds.  Certified  values  are  not 
applicabie  for  ampoules  stored  after  opening,  even  if  resealed. 
Aliquots  should  be  withdrawn  from  the  ampoules 
immediately  after  opening  and  processed  without  delay  for  the  certified  values  in  Table  1  to  be  valid  within  the  stated 
uncertainty. 
However,  if  this  is  impossible  or  impractical,  we  recommend  that  after  aliquots  are  removed  from  the 
ampoules,  they  should  be  transferred  to  amber  containers  and  not  be  stored  at  room  temperature  for  more  than  12  hours 
before  use.  The  toxicity  or  carcinogenicity 
/  mutagenicity  of  the  N-PAH  in  this  SRM  has  not  been  precisely  defined; 
however,  this  material  should  be  treated  as  a  potential  health  hazard. 
Preparation  and  analytical  determinations  for  this  standard  were  performed  in  the  Organic  Analytical  Research 
Division,  Center  for  Analytical  Chemistry,  by  W.F.  Kline,  R.M.  Parris,  R.E.  Rebbert,  and  L.T.  Sniegoski. 
Consultation  on  the  statistical  design  of  the  experimental  work  was  provided  by  R.C.  Paule  of  the  National  Measure- 
ment  Laboratory. 
The  coordination  of  the  technical  measurements  leading  to  certification  were  performed  under  the  direction  of 
W.F.  Kline,  S.A.  Wise,  and  W.E.  May. 
The  technical  and  support  aspects  involved  in  the  preparation,  certification,  and  issuance  of  this  Standard  Reference 
material  were  coordinated  through  the  Office  of  Standard  Reference  Materials  by  R.  Alvarez.

Preparation  and  Analysis 

The  methanol  solution  of  seven  N-PAH  was  prepared  and  ampouled in  the  NBS  Toxic  Chemicals  Handling  Facility. 
Approximately  6.3  L  of  methanol in  a  7-L  glass  Erlenmeyer  flask  were  purged  with  argon  at  a  flow  rate  of  approximately 
400  mL/min  for  1.5  hours.  The  mass  of  the  methanol  was  then  determined  using  a  top-loading  balance.  The  flask  was 
sealed  with  a  *Teflon-covered  stopper  and  covered  with  black  plastic.  An  electrobalance  was  used  to  determine  the  mass 
of  each  N-PAH  component  added.  The  gold  foil  weighing  boat  containing  the  N-PAH  sample  was  transferred  to  the 
flask  containing  the  methanol.  After  all  seven  of  the  nitro-PAH  had  been  transferred,  the  headspace  in  the  flask  was 
again  filled  with  argon  and  the  stopper  was  secured  onto  the  flask.  The  solution  was  magnetically  stirred  for  20  hours in 
the  dark  at  room  temperature.  Each  2-mL  amber  ampoule  was  purged  with  argon  at  a  flow  rate  of  approximately 
600  mL/min  just  prior  to  the  addition  of  approximately  one  mL  of  solution  to  the  ampoule  which  was  then  flame  sealed. 
The  solution  was  not  stirred  during  the  ampouling  process.  An  argon-filled  Teflon  gas  bag  was  used  as  a  reservoir  of 
argon  to  fill  the  headspace  of  the  flask  created  as  the  solution  was  removed  during  the  ampouling  process. 

Six  randomly  selected  ampoules  were  analyzed  in  duplicate  by  GC  on  a  DB-5  (30  m  x  0.25  mm  I.D.  x  0.25  um  film) 
column  using  helium  as  a  carrier  gas  together  with  flame  ionization  (FID)  detection.  The  column  was  temperature 
programmed  from  60  to  240  °C  at  a  rate  of  30  °C/min  and  from  240  to  270°C  at  a  rate  of  10°C/min.  Quantification 
was  accomplished  using  benz{a]anthracene  as  an  internal  standard.  Two  independently  prepared  calibration  solutions 
were  used  to  establish  detector  response  factors. 
A  representative  chromatogram  from  the  GC  analyses  is  shown  in 
Figure  1. 

Sixteen  randomly  selected  ampoules  were  analyzed  in  duplicate  by  HPLC  on  a  Cig  column  *(Zorbax  ODS)  using  a 
methanol/water  mobile  phase  with  UV  detection  at  254  nm.  Separation  of  the  N-PAH  was  accomplished  using  an 
isocratic  mobile  phase  at  70  percent  methanol  in  water  for  10  minutes,  followed  by  a  linear  gradient  to  100  percent 
methanol  in  20  minutes.  Column  temperature  was  maintained  at  30°C. 
Quantification  was  accomplished  using 
fluorene  as  an  internal  standard.  Three  independently  prepared  calibration  solutions  were  used  to  establish  detector 
response  factors. 
A  representative  chromatogram  from  the  HPLC  analyses is  shown in  figure  2. 

In  addition  to  the  chromatograms  provided  in  figures  1  and  2,  GC  and  HPLC  retention  index  data  are  provided  to  assist 
the  user  in  identifying  the  individual  N-PAH  compounds  in  this  SRM.  These  data  are  not  certified  and  are  provided  for 
information  only.  GC  retention  index  data  are  listed  in  Table  3.  HPLC  retention  indices  for  the  N-PAH  on  both  a 
monomeric  and  a  polymeric  C-18  column  and  using  methanol/water  and  acetonitrile  /  water  mobile  phase  are  provided 
in  Table  4.

Bureau  of  Standards.

The  uncertainties 

“The  certified  values  and  associated  uncertainties  were  derived  from  the  weighted  combination  of  liquid 
and  gas  chromatographic  data  as  described  by  Paule  and  Mandel  in  “Consensus  Values  and  Weighting 
Factors,”  Journal  of  Research  of  the  National  Bureau  of  Standards,  Vol.  87,  No.  5,  Sept-Oct  (1982), 
pp  377-385. 
“These  values  are  provided  for  user  convenience  and  were  obtained  from  the  certified  concentration  in 
ug/g. 
apply  only  at  23  °C.  This  SRM  may  be  used  between  19  and  27  °C,  but  a 
concentration  change  of  up  to  1%  will  occur  because  of  the  change  of  the  density  of  methanol  with 
temperature. 
*The  listed  uncertaintes  are  two  standard  deviations  of  the  values  and  include  both  within-  and  between- 
analytical  method  differences  and,  where  observed,  vial-to-vial  variability. 
‘Concentration  data  for  6-nitrobenzo{a]pyrene  is  provided  for  information  only.  The  analytical  data  for 
6-nitrobenzo{a}pyrene  exhibited  the  largest  uncertainty  and  largest  between-bottle  variability.  Also,  the 
solubility  of  this  compound  in  the  SRM  solution  appears  to  be  borderline.
