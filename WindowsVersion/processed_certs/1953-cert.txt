This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended for use in evaluating analytical methods for the determination of 
selected polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners, chlorinated pesticides, polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) 
congeners,  and  elements  in  human  milk  and  similar  matrices.    Reference  concentration  values  are  provided  for 
polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), as well as some inorganic 
constituents.    An  information  concentration  value  is  provided  for  the  PCB  mixture  Aroclor 1260.    All  of  the 
constituents  for  which  certified,  reference,  and  information  concentration  values  are  provided  in  SRM 1953  are 
naturally  present  in  the  milk.    A  unit  of  SRM 1953  consists  of  five  bottles  of  approximately  5 mL  of  frozen 
non-fortified human milk. 
 
The  development  of  SRM 1953  was  a  collaboration  between  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and 
Technology (NIST) and the Division of Laboratory Sciences, Organic Analytical Toxicology Branch, U.S. Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 
 
PCB 
Certified  Concentration  Values:    Certified  values  for  concentrations,  expressed  as  mass  fractions,  for  PCB 
congeners, chlorinated pesticides, and PBDE congeners along with a polybrominated biphenyl congener are provided 
in Tables 1, 2, and 3, respectively.  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its 
accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [1].  The certified 
values  for the PCB congeners, chlorinated pesticides, and PBDE congeners are based on the agreement of results 
obtained  at  NIST  using  one  or  more  analytical  techniques  and  additional  results  from  the  CDC  and  from  an 
interlaboratory study using different analytical techniques. 
 
Reference Concentration Values:  Reference concentration values, expressed as mass fractions, are provided in 
Table 4  for  additional  PCB  congeners  (some  in  combination),  chlorinated  pesticides,  and  PBDE  congeners;  in 
Table 5 for elements; and in Table 6 for PCDD and PCDF congeners.  Reference values are noncertified values that 
are estimates of the true value; however, the values do not meet the NIST criteria for certification and are provided 
with associated uncertainties that may reflect only measurement precision, may not include all sources of uncertainty, 
or may reflect a lack of sufficient statistical agreement among multiple analytical methods [1]. 
 
Information Concentration Value:  An information concentration value for Aroclor 1260 is provided in Table 7.  
An information value is considered to be a value that will be of use to the SRM user, but insufficient information is 
available to assess the uncertainty associated with the value or only a limited number of analyses were performed [1].  
Information values cannot be used to establish metrological traceability. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 1953 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
instructions  given  in  this  certificate 
until 31 August 2025, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with instructions given in this certificate 
(see  “Instructions  for  Storage  and  Use”).    The  certification  is  nullified  if  the  SRM  is  damaged,  contaminated,  or 
RM  is  damaged,  contaminated,  or 
otherwise modified.  
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Overall direction and coordination of technical measurements leading to certification were performed by J.L. Reiner, 
L.C. Sander, S.A. Wise, and M.M. Schantz of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division.

NOTICE AND WARNING TO USERS 
 
SRM 1953  IS  INTENDED  FOR  RESEARCH  USE.    THIS  IS  A  HUMAN  SOURCE  MATERIAL.    HANDLE 
PRODUCT  AS  A  BIOHAZARDOUS  MATERIAL  CAPABLE  OF  TRANSMITTING  INFECTIOUS  DISEASE.  
The milk was pasteurized prior to preparation of SRM 1953.  However, no known test method can offer complete 
assurance that infectious agents are absent from this material.  Accordingly, this human milk-based product should be 
handled  at  the  Biosafety  Level  2  or  higher  as  recommended  for  any  POTENTIALLY  INFECTIOUS  HUMAN 
SPECIMEN in the CDC/National Institutes of Health (NIH) Manual [2]. 
 
STORAGE  AND  USE 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE AND USE 
 
exposed  to  sunlight 
Storage:  The milk is frozen and should be stored in a freezer at –20 °C until use.  It should not be exposed to sunlight 
or ultraviolet radiation.  After thawing, the contents should be used immediately. 
 
Use:  Bring the vial to room temperature.  Once the milk is thawed, mix contents by gently swirling.  Do not shake 
vigorously because this will cause frothing.  The recommended minimum sample size is 0.25 g.  
 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Source  of  Material:    Milk  was  acquired  from  six  milk  banks  located  around  the  U.S:    Florida  (4 %), 
North Carolina (6 %), Iowa (6 %), Delaware (7 %), California (12 %), and Texas (65 %). 
 
Preparation of Material:  The milk was pooled (approximately 100 L total) and was stored at 4 °C.  The pool was 
split into two for production of SRM 1953 and SRM 1954 Organic Contaminants in Fortified Human Milk.  Using a 
calibrated automatic pipetter, 5 mL aliquots of milk were dispensed into 10 mL amber glass vials. 
 
Analytical Methods Used at NIST:  For NIST Method 1, the frozen  milk in each of ten bottles  was thawed.    A 
known  amount  of  internal  standard  solution  (containing  selected  13C-labeled  PCB  congeners,  selected 
13C-labeled pesticides,  13C-labeled PBDE 209, fluorinated PBDE 47, PCB 103, and PCB 198) was added to 
each  bottle,  sonicated  for  15  min,  and  allowed  to  equilibrate  overnight  under  refrigeration.    After  samples  were 
removed  from  refrigeration  and  allowed  to  reach  ambient  temperature,  10 mL  of  formic  acid  was  added,  as  a 
denaturation agent, followed immediately by 10 mL of a 1+1 (volume fraction) mixture of n-hexane:methyl-tert-butyl 
ether  for  extraction.    The  samples  were  vortexed  and  left  to  stand  for  0.5 h  with  occasional  stirring.    After 
centrifugation to obtain a sharp phase boundary, the upper organic phase was transferred to a concentration vessel.  
The extraction was repeated two more times with 10 mL of n-hexane each time.  The combined organic layers were 
concentrated to approximately 4 mL using an automated evaporation system.  Approximately 2 mL of concentrated 
sulfuric acid was added to the concentration vessel with swirling.  Following phase separation, the organic phase was 
removed,  and  the  sulfuric  acid  phase  was  washed  twice  using  4 mL  portions  of  n-hexane.   The  combined  hexane 
phases were concentrated to approximately 0.5 mL for silica solid-phase extraction (SPE) clean-up.  The fraction of 
interest was eluted with 15 mL of 10 % (volume fraction) dichloromethane in hexane.  The concentrated samples were 
analyzed  using  gas  chromatography/mass  spectrometry (GC-MS)  operated  in  both  the  electron  impact (EI)  and

negative  ion  chemical  ionization (NICI)  mode.    A 0.25 mm × 60 m  fused  silica  capillary  column  containing  a 
non-polar proprietary phase (DB-XLB, Agilent Technologies, Wilmington, DE), 0.25 µm film thickness, was used 
for the EI analysis (NIST Method 1a) while a 0.25 mm × 60 m fused silica capillary column containing a 50 % (mole 
fraction) phenyl-substituted methylpolysiloxane phase (DB-17MS, Agilent Technologies), 0.25 µm  film thickness, 
was used for the NICI analysis (NIST Method 1b).  All injections were 1 µL using an on-column inlet. 
  
For NIST Method 2, the frozen  milk in each of  six bottles  was thawed.    A  known  amount  of  internal  standard 
solution  (containing  selected  13C-labeled  PCB  congeners,  selected  13C-labeled  pesticides,  13C-labeled 
PBDE 209, and  selected  fluorinated PBDE  congeners) was  added  to a 2.5 g milk subsample from each bottle, 
vortexed, and allowed to equilibrate overnight under refrigeration.  After samples were removed from refrigeration 
and allowed to reach ambient temperature, 2 2 mL of formic acid was added followed by 3 mL 20 % (volume fraction) 
dichloromethane in hexane.  Samples were extracted using a focused microwave extraction.  Following extraction, 
samples  were  centrifuged,  the  organic  phase  was  removed,  and  another  3 mL  of  20 %  (volume  fraction) 
dichloromethane  in  hexane  was  added.    The  extraction  was  repeated,  and  the  organic  phases  were  combined.  
Following concentration with a solvent exchange to isooctane, sulfuric acid-silica column clean-up was used, followed 
by alumina column (5 % deactivated) clean-up.  The eluant from the clean-up columns was concentrated to 0.2 mL 
with a solvent change to iso-octane for analysis.  The concentrated samples were analyzed using GC/MS in the EI 
mode  (NIST  Method  2a)  with  a  0.18 mm  ×  30 m  fused  silica  capillary  column  containing  a  5 %  (mole  fraction) 
phenyl-substituted  methylpolysiloxane  phase  (DB-5MS,  Agilent  Technologies),  0.18 µm  film  thickness.    All 
injections were 20 µL using a programmable temperature vaporization (PTV) inlet.  For NIST Method 2b, the same 
extracts were analyzed by GC/MS in the NICI mode using on-column injection into a 0.18 mm × 10 m fused silica 
capillary column containing a 5 % (mole fraction) phenyl-substituted methylpolysiloxane phase (DB-5MS, Agilent 
Technologies), 0.18 µm film thickness. 
 
For all of the NIST methods, multi-point calibration response curves  for the compounds of interest relative to the 
internal  standards  were  determined  by  processing  gravimetrically  diluted  solutions  of  SRM 2261,  SRM 2262, 
SRM 2274,  and  SRM 2275  plus  gravimetrically  prepared  solutions  of  the  additional  analytes  of  interest  with  the 
internal standards added. 
 
Analytical Methods Used at CDC:  Details of the analytical methods used at CDC can be found in Patterson and 
Turner [3]  and  Sjödin  et  al. [4].    In  summary,  the  frozen  milk  was  thawed  and  mixed.    Sample  extraction  was 
performed using a C18 SPE method.  After addition of the internal standard solution and formic acid, the sample was 
eluted through an SPE column using appropriate solvents.  The eluant was then cleaned up using a Universal Prep 
system  (Fluid  Management  Systems,  Waltham,  MA)  containing  an  acid/neutral/base  silica  column,  an  alumina 
column, and a carbon column.  Corresponding 13C-labeled compounds were used as internal standards for the majority 
of the analytes. 
 
Gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC/HRMS) with mass resolution of 10 000 was used for the 
determination  of  the  PCBs,  chlorinated  pesticides,  PBDEs,  PCDDs,  and  PCDFs.    The  GC  column  was  a 
0.25 mm × 30 m fused silica capillary column containing a 5 % (mole fraction) phenyl-substituted methylpolysiloxane 
phase (DB-5MS, J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA), 0.25 µm film thickness.  All injections were splitless with helium as 
the carrier gas. 
 
Interlaboratory Study:  The three laboratories participating in the interlaboratory study used their usual methods for 
these analyses.  Not every laboratory reported data for every analyte.  When more than one laboratory did report data 
for a particular analyte, the mean of the concentrations was used for combination with other data to assign the certified 
and reference concentration values.  
 
Non-Volatile Extractable Mass Determination:  The percent of non-volatile extractable material (or total extractable 
organics, TEO) was determined gravimetrically for the data sets described above.  Non-volatile extractable material is 
3.25 %  ±  0.29 % (95 % confidence interval for the mean). 
 
inductively  coupled  plasma  mass
Total  Iodine:    The  concentration  value  for  iodine  was  measured  using  inductively  coupled  plasma  mass 
spectrometry (ICP-MS).  Test portions (1 g) were either (1) microwave digested or (2) diluted with water.  To correct 
for matrix effects caused by differences between samples and calibrants, the method of standard additions was used 
for each test portion. 
 
Total Mercury:  The concentration value for mercury is derived from isotope dilution cold vapor inductively coupled 
plasma mass spectrometry measurements performed at NIST [5–7]. 
 
Other Elements: The concentration values for calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, potassium, 
sodium, and zinc were measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES).  Test

portions (10 g) were digested in nitric acid.  To correct for matrix effects caused by differences between samples and 
calibrants, the method of standard additions was used.  Results from the ICP-OES measurement were corrected for 
spike recoveries. 
 
Homogeneity Assessment:    The  homogeneity  of  PCBs,  pesticides,  and  PBDEs  was  assessed  at  NIST  by  using 
Method 1.  An analysis of variance did not show inhomogeneity for a 5 g sample.  Other analytes were treated as 
though they were homogeneously distributed in the material although homogeneity was not assessed.

Malisch [9] to conform with IUPAC rules.  For the specific congeners mentioned in this table, the Ballschmiter-Zell numbers 
correspond to those of Schulte and Malisch.  When two or more congeners are known to coelute under the GC analysis conditions 
used, the PCB congener listed first is the major component and the additional congeners may be present as minor components.  
The quantitative results are based on the response of the congener listed first.

(a) PCB congeners are numbered according to the scheme proposed by Ballschmiter and Zell [8] and later revised by Schulte and 
Malisch [9] to conform with IUPAC rules.  When two or more congeners are known to coelute under the GC analysis conditions 
used, the PCB congener listed first is the major component and the additional congeners may be present as minor components.  
The  quantitative  results  are  based on  the  response of  the  congener  listed  first.   PBDE  congeners are  numbered  according  to 
IUPAC rules.  

(b) CDC method using GC/HRMS. 
(c) Reference values are the means of results using one analytical technique.  The expanded uncertainty, U, is calculated as U = kuc, 
where uc is one standard deviation of the analyte mean, and the coverage factor, k, is determined from the Student’s t-distribution 
corresponding to the associated degrees of freedom and 95 % confidence level for each analyte.  The measurand is the mass fraction 
as determined by the indicated method.  The reference values are metrologically traceable to the SI unit for mass, expressed as 
nanograms per kilogram. 

(d) Results from interlaboratory study. 
(e) Reference values are unweighted means of the results from two or three analytical methods.  The uncertainty listed with the 
value is an expanded uncertainty about the mean, with coverage factor 2, calculated by combining a between-method variance 
[10] with a pooled, within-method variance following the ISO/JCGM Guide [11]. 

(f) NIST Method 1b using liquid-liquid extraction followed by GC/MS in the NICI mode (same extracts as NIST Method 1a). 
(g) NIST Method 2a using using focused microwave extraction followed by GC/MS in the EI mode. 
(h) Reference values are weighted means of the results from four analytical methods [12].  The uncertainty listed with each value is 
an expanded uncertainty about the mean, with coverage factor 2 (approximately 95 % confidence) calculated by combining a 
between-method  variance  incorporating  inter-method  bias  with  a  pooled  within-source  variance  following  the  ISO/JCGM 
Guide [11].  The measurand is the mass fraction as determined by the indicated method.  The reference values are metrologically 
traceable to the SI unit for mass, expressed as nanograms per kilogram.

(a) The reference value is the unweighted mean of the results from two analytical methods except for octachlorodibenzofuran.  The 
uncertainty listed with the value is an expanded uncertainty about the mean, with coverage factor 2, calculated by combining a 
between-method variance [10] with a pooled, within-method variance following the ISO/JCGM Guide [11].  The reference value 
for octachlorodibenzofuran is the mean of results using one analytical technique.  The expanded uncertainty, U, is calculated as 
U =  kuc,  where  uc  is  one  standard  deviation  of  the  analyte  mean,  and  the  coverage  factor,  k,  is  determined  from  the  Student’s 
t-distribution corresponding to the associated degrees of freedom and 95 % confidence level for each analyte.  The measurand is the 
mass fraction as determined by the indicated method.  The reference values are metrologically traceable to the SI unit for mass, 
expressed as picograms per kilogram.
