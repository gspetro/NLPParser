Certificate of Analysis 
 
Standard Reference Material® 1575a 
 
Trace Elements in Pine Needles (Pinus taeda) 

Needles 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended primarily for use in the evaluation of techniques employed in 
the analysis of pine needles and materials of a similar matrix.  A unit of SRM 1575a consists of approximately 50 g 
of dried, jet-milled, radiation sterilized, and blended pine needles. 
 
Certified  Values:    The  certified  values  for  twelve  elements,  expressed  as  mass  fractions [1]  on  a  dry-mass,  are 
provided in Table 1.  The certified value for mercury is based on results from a single NIST primary method, cold 
vapor isotope dilution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and was confirmed by radiochemical neutron 
activation  analysis  at  NIST.    Certified  values  for  other  elements  are  based  on  results  from  two  or  more  critically 
evaluated  independent  analytical  techniques.    Analyses  were  performed  at  NIST  and  at  United  States  Geological 
Survey (USGS), Denver, CO.  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its 
accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [2]. 
 
Reference Values:  The reference values for eleven constituents, expressed as mass fractions on a dry-mass basis, are 
provided  in  Table 2.    The  reference  values  are  based  on  results  obtained  from  a  single  NIST  analytical  method.  
Reference values are noncertified values that are estimates of the true value.  However, the values do not meet the 
NIST  criteria  for  certification  and  are  provided  with  associated  uncertainties  that  may  not  include  all  sources  of 
uncertainty [2]. 
 
Information Values:  Information values for two elements are provided in Table 3.  An information value is a value 
that may be of interest to the SRM user, but insufficient information is available to assess the uncertainty associated 
with the value [2].  Information values cannot be used to establish metrological traceability.  
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 1575a is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until  01 August 2022  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  given  in  this 
certificate (see “Instructions for Use”).  This certification is nullified if the SRM is contaminated, contaminated or 
otherwise modified.

Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
Coordination  of  the  technical  measurements  leading  to  certification  was  performed  by  E.A. Mackey  of  the  NIST 
Chemical Sciences Division.  A complete list of analysts is given in Table 5.   
 
Statistical analyses were provided by H-k. Liu and J. Lu of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division.

The  protocol  used  for  obtaining  the  pine  needles  was  developed  by  D.A. Becker  of  the  NIST  Chemical  Sciences 
Division.    The  needles  were  collected  by  members  of  the  Forest  Nutrition  Cooperative  of  North  Carolina  State 
University.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 
 
Sampling:  The SRM should be thoroughly mixed by repeatedly inverting and rotating the bottle horizontally before 
sampling.  A minimum sample mass of 250 mg should be used for analytical determinations to be related to elemental 
concentration values provided.  The SRM should be stored in its original, tightly sealed bottle away from sunlight and 
intense sources of radiation. 
 
Drying:  In order to relate measurements to the certified and reference values that are expressed on a dry mass basis, 
users should determine a drying correction at the time of each analysis by desiccator drying for five days over fresh 
magnesium perchlorate or equivalent.  Freeze-drying for six days at 1 Pa with a condenser temperature of 50 °C, 
initial shelf temperature of –10 °C and final shelf temperature of 5 °C provided equivalent results.  The average mass 
loss measured at NIST using these two methods for SRM 1575a was 2.9 % (1 s = 0.2 %, n = 14).  No significant 
difference between these two methods was observed.  The amount of moisture in this material may vary depending 
on storage and environmental conditions. 
 
SOURCE, PREPARATION, AND ANALYSIS 
 
rom  freshly 
The pine needles for this SRM were collected from loblolly pine trees (Pinus taeda) in North Carolina from freshly 
felled trees of approximately the same age and origin.  The needles were dried at 70 °C for 48 h, coarse ground to pass 
through a 2 mm sieve and shipped to NIST where the material was jet-milled to pass a 100 µm sieve, blended, radiation 
sterilized, and bottled.  Measurements confirmed that the jet-milling process resulted in a powder with particle sizes 
equivalent to spheres ranging in diameter from approximately 1 µm to 100 µm. 
 
Chromium was found to be inhomogenously distributed in this material (for a sample size of 250 mg).  Analysis of a 
total of 58 portions yielded chromium mass fraction values ranging from approximately 0.3 mg/kg to 0.5 mg/kg.  
 
Analyses of this material used for certification were performed at NIST and at USGS.  The analytical techniques used 
for each element are listed in Table 4 and the analysts are listed in Table 5.

(a) The certified values are the average values from two or more analytical methods and the uncertainty values represent expanded 
uncertainties,  which  include  components  of  uncertainty  from  each  method  with  a  Type B  distribution  for  between  method 
uncertainty, combined according to the method described in reference 3 in compliance with the JCGM Guide [4].  The certified 
values are the measurands and are metrologically traceable to the SI derived unit of mass fraction expressed as percent (%) or as 
milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg).

(a) Reference  values  are  based  on  results  of  one  analytical  method  at  NIST  and  the  uncertainty  values  represent  the  expanded 
uncertainties,  which  include  the  combined  Type A,  and  Type B  with  a  coverage  factor,  combined  according  to  the  method 
described in the JCGM Guide [4].  The measurands are the concentrations of the elements listed in Table 2 as determined by the 
methods in Table 4.  Metrological traceability is the SI derived units for mass fraction, expressed as percent or milligrams per 
kilogram.
