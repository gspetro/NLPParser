Standard Reference Material® 1582 

 

 
Petroleum Crude Oil 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended for use in evaluating analytical methods for the determination of 
selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), hopanes, and steranes in a crude oil matrix.  All of the constituents 
for which certified and reference values are provided are naturally present in the oil.  A unit of SRM 1582 consists of five 
ampoules, each containing approximately 1.2 mL of crude oil. 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values:  Certified values for 20 PAHs are provided in Table 1.  A NIST certified value is a 
value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been 
investigated or taken into account [1].  The certified values are based on the agreement of results obtained at NIST using 
multiple analytical techniques. 
 
Reference Mass Fraction Values:  Reference values are provided in Table 2 for 18 additional PAHs, in Table 3 for 
35 groups of alkylated PAHs, and in Table 4 for 15 hopanes and steranes.  Reference values are noncertified values that 
are the best estimate  of the true value; however, the values do not meet the NIST criteria for certification and are 
provided with associated uncertainties that may reflect only measurement precision, may not include all sources of 
uncertainty, or may reflect a lack of sufficient statistical agreement among multiple analytical methods [1]. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 1582 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until 30 September 2020, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given in this 
certificate (see “Instructions for Handling, Storage, and Use”).  This certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, 
contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
The overall direction and coordination of technical measurements leading to the update of the certification of SRM 1582 
were performed by M.M. Schantz and L.C. Sander of the NIST Analytical Chemistry Division. 
 
Analytical  measurements  at  NIST  to  update  SRM 1582  were  performed  by  B.A. Benner, Jr.,  J.R. Kucklick,  and 
M.M. Schantz of the NIST Analytical Chemistry Division.  Additional results for PAHs, hopanes, and steranes were used 
from 24 laboratories (see Appendix A) that participated in an interlaboratory study coordinated by M.M. Schantz of the 
NIST Analytical Chemistry Division. 
 
Evaluation of the data was provided by N.A. Heckert, S.D. Leigh, and A.L. Pintar of the NIST Statistical Engineering 
Division.  
 
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Measurement  Services 
Division.

INSTRUCATIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
Handling:  This material is naturally occurring crude oil and may contain constituents of unknown toxicities; therefore, 
caution and care should be exercised during its handling and use.  Consult the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS), 
enclosed with the SRM shipment, for details.   
 
Storage:  Sealed ampoules, as received, should be stored in the dark at temperatures between 10 °C and 30 °C. 
 
Use:  Samples for analysis should be withdrawn immediately after opening ampoules and should be processed without 
delay for the certified values in Table 1 to be valid within the stated uncertainties.  Certified values are not applicable to 
material stored in ampoules that have been opened, even if they are resealed. 
 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Sample  Collection  and  Preparation:    The  petroleum  crude  oil  for  this  SRM  came  from  the  U.S.  Environmental 
Protection Agency’s repository at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN.  The oil was homogenized by 
stirring for 18 h in a 6 L glass flask before transferring into 5 mL amber glass ampoules which had been flushed with 
argon. 
 
PAHs, Hopanes, and Steranes:  The general approach used for the value assignment of the PAHs, hopanes, and 
steranes  in  SRM 1582  consisted  of  combining  results  from  analyses  using  various  combinations  of  different 
cleanup/isolation procedures and chromatographic separation and detection techniques [2]. 
 
Three sets of gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) results, designated as GC/MS (I) through GC/MS (III), were 
obtained  at  NIST.    For  GC/MS (I)  analyses,  duplicate  test  portions  of  400 mg  from  three  ampoules  of  SRM 1582  were 
transferred to individual vials, spiked with a known amount of an internal standard solution (see below), and diluted with hexane. 
A portion of the diluted oil (0.5 mL) was fractionated using an aminopropyl solid-phase extraction (SPE) column to isolate the 
fraction of interest.  Following a concentration step, the processed extract was then fractionated using liquid chromatography on a 
semi-preparative scale aminopropyl silane column.  Three fractions were collected:  (1) aliphatics, hopanes, and steranes; 
(2) naphthalene through the dimethylphenanthrenes and anthracenes; and (3) the remainder of the PAHs through molecular 
mass 302 Da.  Each fraction was then analyzed by GC/MS using a 0.25 mm i.d. × 60 m fused silica capillary column with a 50 % 
(mole fraction) phenyl methylpolysiloxane phase (0.25 μm film thickness; DB-17MS, Agilent Technologies, Wilmington, DE).  
Fractions 2 and 3 were also analyzed using a 0.25 mm i.d. × 15 m fused silica capillary column with a 50 % (mole fraction) 
liquid crystal polysiloxane phase (0.15 μm film thickness; LC-50, J&K Scientific, Milton, Ontario, Canada).  The results from 
the DB-17MS column are denoted as GC/MS Ia and those from the LC-50 column as GC/MS Ib. 
 
For the GC/MS (II) determination of the PAHs, one test portion (90 mg to 100 mg) from each of six ampoules was transferred to 
a vial, spiked with a known amount of internal standard solution (see below), and diluted with 2 % dichloromethane in hexane 
(volume fractions).  A portion of the diluted oil (0.1 mL) was fractionated using an aminopropyl solid-phase extraction (SPE) 
column to isolate the fraction of interest.  Following a concentration step, the isolated fraction was analyzed by GC/MS using a 
0.25 mm i.d. × 60 m fused silica capillary column with a 50 % phenyl methylpolysiloxane phase (0.25 μm film thickness; ZB-50 
column, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). 
 
For the GC/MS (III) determination of the PAHs, hopanes, and steranes, one test portion (1 mL, exact mass known) from each of 
three ampoules was transferred to a bottle and diluted with 25 mL of hexane (exact mass known) prior to adding the internal 
standards (see below).  The extracts were fractionated into two fractions using a silica/alumina column with the majority of the 
aliphatics, hopanes, and steranes in fraction 1 and the majority of the PAHs in fraction 2.  The analytes of interest were quantified 
using GC/MS on a 0.25 mm i.d. × 60 m fused silica capillary column with a 50 % (mole fraction) phenyl methylpolysiloxane 
phase (0.25 μm film thickness; Rxi-17sil MS, Restek, Bellefonte, PA). 
 
For the methods described above, selected perdeuterated PAHs and perdeuterated aliphatics were added to the crude oil as 
described above for use as internal standards for quantification purposes.   
 
In  addition  to  the  analyses  performed  at  NIST,  SRM 1582  was  used  in  an  interlaboratory  comparison  exercise  in 
2011 [3].    Results  from  24 laboratories  that  participated  in  this  exercise  were  used  as  the  fourth  data  set  in  the 
                     

(1)  Certain  commercial  equipment,  instruments  or  materials  are  identified  in  this  certificate  to  adequately  specify  the 
experimental procedure.  Such identification does not imply recommendation or endorsement by the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the purpose.

determination of the values for PAHs, hopanes, and steranes in SRM 1582.  Note that not all laboratories returned data 
for each analyte.  The laboratories participating in this exercise used the analytical procedures routinely used in their 
laboratories to measure the analytes of interest.  For the alkylated PAHs, the majority of the laboratories (>90 %) used the 
parent PAH for determination of the response factor for the corresponding alkylated group. 
 
Homogeneity Assessment for PAHs:  The homogeneity of SRM 1582 was assessed during the original certification study.  No 
differences among ampoules were observed for the PAHs at the 100 mg sample size.
