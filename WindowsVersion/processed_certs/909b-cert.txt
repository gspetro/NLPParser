Standard Reference Material® 909b 
Human Serum 

 

 

 

 
This  Standard  Reference  Material  (SRM)  is  a  lyophilized  human  serum  material  primarily  intended  for  use  in 
evaluating  the  accuracy  of  higher-order  clinical  methods  for  the  determination  of  specified  constituents  in  human 
serum.    It  can  also  be  used  to  validate  working  or  secondary  reference  materials.    Because  of  matrix  effects 
associated with serum that has been lyophilized, some routine clinical methods may exhibit a bias in results between 
fresh  (or  fresh-frozen)  serum  and  lyophilized  serum.    A  unit  of  SRM  909b  consists  of  six  bottles  of  lyophilized 
human  serum  (three  bottles  each  of  two  different  analyte  concentration  levels)  and  six  bottles  of  deionized, 
autoclaved water (11.5 mL each).  Before use, the serum in each bottle is to be reconstituted with 10.00 mL of the 
water provided.  
 
Certified Concentration Values:  Certified concentrations and their uncertainties for the two concentration levels 
(SRM 909b-I  and  SRM 909b-II) are provided in Tables 1, 1a, and 2.  A NIST certified value is a value for which 
NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated 
or taken into account [1].  The certified concentrations were determined using higher-order reference measurement 
procedures [2-13] calibrated with NIST high-purity SRMs.  This calibration provides direct traceability to the mole 
for  the  certified  analytes  in  this  SRM.    The  certified  concentrations  apply  only  to  reconstituted  serum  at  room 
temperature (20 C to 25 C).  See “Instructions for Use”. 
 
Reference Concentration Values:  Reference concentration values for total bilirubin are provided in Table 3.  The 
reference  concentrations  were  derived  from  results  reported  by  two  collaborating  laboratories  and  NIST.    The 
reference  values  are  noncertified  values  that  do  not  meet  NIST  criteria  for  certification  and  are  provided  with 
associated uncertainties that may reflect only measurement precision, may not include all sources of uncertainty, or 
may reflect a lack of sufficient statistical agreement among multiple methods [1]. 
 
Information  Values:    Information  values  for  the  activity  of  selected  enzymes  and  pH  are  provided  in  Table 4.  
Information values for uric acid are provided in Tables 5, 5a, and 6.  A NIST information value is a value that may 
be of interest to the SRM user, but insufficient information is available to assess the uncertainty associated with the 
value, therefore no uncertainty is provided [1]. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of this SRM lot is valid, within the measurement uncertainties, until 
the  date  stamped  on  the  outer  box  label  (DO  NOT  DISCARD),  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in 
accordance  with  the  instructions  given  in  this  certificate.    However,  the  certification  is  invalid  if  the  SRM  is 
damaged, contaminated, or modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
The  overall  direction  and  coordination  of  the  analyses  were  performed  by  M.J.  Welch  of  the  NIST  Analytical 
Chemistry Division.

NOTICE AND WARNINGS TO USERS  
WARNING:    SRM 909b  IS  INTENDED  FOR  IN-VITRO  DIAGNOSTIC  USE  ONLY.    THIS  IS  A  HUMAN-
SOURCE  MATERIAL. 
  HANDLE  PRODUCT  AS  A  BIOHAZARDOUS  MATERIAL  CAPABLE  OF 
TRANSMITTING INFECTIOUS DISEASE.  The supplier of this serum has reported that each donor unit of serum 
or  plasma  used  in  the  preparation  of  this  product  had  been  tested  by  an  FDA-approved  method  and  found  non-
reactive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 antibody.  However, 
no known test method can offer complete assurance that hepatitis B virus, HIV, or other infectious agents are absent 
from  this  material.    Accordingly,  this  human  blood-based  product  should  be  handled  at  the  Biosafety  Level  2  or 
higher  as  recommended  for  any  potentially  infectious  human  serum  or  blood  specimen  in  Biosafety  in 
Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories [14]. 
 
Stability and Storage:  The serum comprising SRM 909b is lyophilized (freeze-dried) material and should be stored 
in a refrigerator at a temperature between 2 C and 8 C until ready for use.  It should NOT be frozen or exposed to 
sunlight or ultraviolet radiation. 
 
Reconstituted Material:  After reconstitution, the contents should be used immediately or stored between 2 C and 
8 C until ready for use, preferably within 4 h.  Freezing of the reconstituted material is not recommended. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE  
 
Remove a bottle from the refrigerator and equilibrate at room temperature before reconstitution.  Tap the bottom of 
the  bottle  to  dislodge  any  serum  particles  from  the  stopper.    Carefully  remove  the  metal  seal.    Take  extra  care  in 
removing  the  stopper,  as  the  lyophilized  serum  may  adhere  to  the  stopper.    Using  a  Type  I  Class  A  calibrated 
volumetric  transfer  pipet  or  other  dispenser  of  known  accuracy,  add  10.00 mL  0.02 mL  of  the  diluent  water 
(provided with the SRM).  Replace the stopper, swirl the bottle two or three times, and let stand for 10 min.  Mix the 
contents by gently swirling, let stand for approximately 30 min, swirl again, let stand for 10 min, and finally invert 
the  bottle  several  times.    Repeat  this  process  as  necessary  until  all  material  has  gone  into  solution.    DO  NOT 
SHAKE.  Vigorous shaking or mechanical swirling should be avoided as it may cause the formation of foam that 
may  lead  to  inhomogeneous  distribution  of  the  analytes  within  the  bottle.    Allow  2 h  for  reconstitution.    After 
reconstitution,  the  contents  should  be  used  immediately  or  stored  between  2 C  and  8 C  until  ready  for  use, 
preferably within 4 h. 
 
Fill Mass Correction:  There is a small variability in the fill masses of dry serum.  This variability contributes to the 
uncertainties reported in Tables 1 and 1a.  To determine the concentration corrected for variations in fill mass (as was 
done  for  the  certified  values  in  Table 2),  the  mass  of  dry  serum  in  the  bottle  must  be  determined.    The  following 
procedure is recommended:  prior to opening the bottle, completely remove the bottle label and adhesive by scraping 
and  then  wiping  the  bottle  with  a  tissue  moistened  with  a  solvent  such  as  acetone  or  ethanol.    Scratch  an 

                                                           

1Certain commercial equipment, instruments, or materials are identified in this report to specify adequately the experimental 
procedure.    Such  identification  does  not  imply  recommendation  or  endorsement  by  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and 
Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the purpose.

identification  on  the  bottle,  then  remove  the  metal  closure  and  lightly  tap  the  bottom  of  the  bottle  to  dislodge  any 
serum particles adhering to the stopper.  Carefully dislodge the stopper to equalize air pressure, then replace it.  Wipe 
the  surface  of  the  bottle,  and  weigh  to  the  nearest  0.1 mg;  use  a  clean  empty  bottle  of  the  same  size  as  a  tare.  
Reconstitute  the  serum  as  described  in  the  “Instructions  for  Use”  section.    After  the  reconstituted  serum  has  been 
removed, clean and dry the bottle and its stopper.  Replace the stopper in the bottle and reweigh.  Also, reweigh the 
tare at the same time to compensate for changes in temperature and humidity.  The mass of dry serum is obtained by 
the difference between the original and final weighings.  To compare results with those in Table 2, divide the values 
in Tables 1 or 1a by the grams of dry serum in the bottle.  The mean mass densities at 22.0 C were determined by 
pycnometer to be 1.0221 g/mL  0.0002 g/mL and 1.0370 g/mL  0.0003 g/mL for Levels I and II, respectively, and 
are provided to allow conversions between results in mass fraction and mass concentration units. 
 
Value  Assignment:    For  each  analyte,  a  stratified  sampling  plan  was  devised  to  test  for  homogeneity  across  the 
manufacturing process.  Methods considered to be definitive [2] for clinical analytes by the National Committee for 
Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) were used for the determinations [3–13].  All of the organic analytes were 
determined  using  isotope  dilution  gas  chromatographic  mass  spectrometric  (ID-GC/MS)  methods.    The  inorganic 
analytes were determined using only isotope dilution thermal ionization mass spectrometric (ID-TIMS) methods with 
the  following  exceptions:  sodium  was  determined  using  a  gravimetric  procedure  and  for  chloride,  a  coulometric 
method  was  used  in  addition  to  ID-TIMS.    References  to  the  specific  methods  used  for  each  analyte  are  given  in 
Table 1.

Each  certified  value  in  Tables  1  and  1a  is  the  mean  of  measurements  made  using  a  definitive  method,  except  for 
chloride,  for  which  two  methods  considered  to  be  definitive  were  used.    Each  expanded  uncertainty  [16]  is 
approximately  a  95 %/95 %  statistical  tolerance  interval  which  reflects  the  combined  effects  of  measurement 
imprecision and the variability of the mass of dry serum among bottles [17].  Each interval is constructed so that, at a 
confidence  level  of  95 %,  it  will  include  the  concentration  for  95 %  of  all  of  the  bottles  of  SRM 909b,  when 
reconstituted according to the procedure described in “Instructions for Use” on page 2 of 5 (without determining the 
dry mass of the serum).

that is, each certified value and expanded uncertainty define a range of values within which the true concentration is expected 
to lie with approximately 99 % confidence.

(a) The reference values are the overall means of the measurements made by NIST and two collaborating laboratories, all using the 
same  reference  method  [18].    The  expanded  uncertainty, U,  is  a  95 %  prediction  uncertainty  for a future measurement.  The 
expanded uncertainty is calculated as U = kuc, where uc is at the level of one standard deviation and represents the combined 
effects of between-laboratory components of uncertainty and measurement errors.  The coverage factor k is determined from 
the Student’s t-distribution corresponding to the appropriate degrees of freedom at the 95 % confidence level.
