Standard Reference Material 2870



	Relative Permittivity and Loss Tangent

	1422 Cross-Linked Polystyrene

	

	Specimen No. SAMPLE



This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended for the evaluation of measurement systems used to characterize the relative permittivity and loss tangent of dielectric materials.  A unit of SRM 2870 consists of a cross-linked polystyrene cylindrical disk, nominally 60 mm in diameter and 10 mm thick.  This specimen can be machined to the necessary geometry required by various measurement systems.



Measurements for certifying SRM 2870 were obtained using the cylindrical cavity method described in reference 1.  The particular cavity used was a mode-filtered, circular-cylindrical cavity, nominally 60 mm in diameter and 450 mm in length.  Additional details concerning the resonator theory, measurement procedure, and uncertainty analysis can be found in reference 1.



Certified Values:  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or accounted [2].  Certified relative permittivity and loss tangent values for SRM 2870, measured at 10 GHz, are listed in Table 1.  The measurements were performed at 23 C  1 C and 40 %  5 % relative humidity.  The certified values are valid under these environmental conditions.  Relative permittivity and loss tangent measurements performed on crosslinked polystyrene that are outside of this temperature range can be found in reference 3.



Information Values:  Supplemental values of relative permittivity and loss tangent are given in Table 2.  Although these values are not certified, they provide additional information about the behavior of the relative permittivity and loss tangent of SRM 2870 over a frequency range of 2 GHz to 25 GHz.  All supplemental measurements were performed at 23 C  2 C and 40 %  5 % relative humidity.



Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 2870 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, until 01 January 2024, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given in this certificate (see “Instructions for Storage and Use”).  However, the certification is invalid if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, or otherwise modified.

		

		Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive technical changes occur that affect the certification before the expiration of this certificate, NIST will notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification.

		

		The coordination of the technical measurements leading to the certification of SRM 2870 was under the leadership of M.D. Janezic of the NIST Electromagnetics Division.

		

		Statistical consultation was provided by J.D. Splett and K.J. Coakley of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division.

		

																	Support aspects involved in the issuance of this SRM were coordinated through the Office of Reference Materials.

																	INSTRUCTION FOR STORAGE AND USE

																	Storage:  When not in use, SRM 2870 should be stored at room temperature, below 50 % relative humidity, in the provided container.

																	

																	Instruction for Use and Handling:  Contaminants on the surfaces of the specimen can be a source of measurement error; therefore, prior to measurement, contaminants on the surfaces should be removed.  To remove the contaminants, clean each sample with 99 % pure isopropyl alcohol and a lint-free cloth, making sure that the alcohol has completely evaporated.  In addition, use lint-free gloves to avoid contact with the specimen.

																	

																	PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS()

																	Source and Fabrication of Material:  The cross-linked polystyrene (Rexolite 1422) sheet was manufactured by CLee Plastics (Philadelphia, PA) and fabricated into individual samples by Colorado Precision Optics (Longmount, CO).

	(a)	Certified values of relative permittivity and loss tangent are based on equally weighted means of three repeat measurements completed on different days.  The uncertainty in each certified value is an expanded uncertainty, U = kuc, calculated in accordance with the GUM and NIST Guides [4].  The quantity uc, represents the combined standard uncertainty [4] and k is the coverage factor used to obtain an expanded uncertainty with an approximate confidence level of 95 %.  The coverage factors for permittivity (k = 2) and loss tangent (k = 2.093) are derived from the Student’s tdistribution with > 30 degrees and 19 degrees of freedom, respectively.
