Standard Reference Material® 2393 
 
CAG Repeat Length Mutation in Huntington’s Disease 

 
ignment  of  the  number  of 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended primarily for use in the value assignment of the number of 
Huntington’s  disease  [CAG]  trinucleotide  repeats  contained  in  a  human  genomic  material  [1–3].    The  six 
component  genomic  DNA  materials,  labeled  A  to  F,  are  from  DNA  extracted  from  cell  lines  derived  from 
Huntington’s  disease  samples.    A  unit  of  SRM  2393  consists  of  six  sterile  0.5  mL  perfluoroalkoxy  (PFA) 
fluoropolymer vials, each vial containing approximately 50 µL of DNA solution of each individual component. 
 
Certified Values of the Number of Huntington’s Disease [CAG] Repeats:  Table 1 lists the certified number of 
[CAG]  repeats  for  each  component.    These  certified  values  were  determined  by  counting  the  number  of 
[CAG]  repeat  units  in  the  component  alleles  by  Sanger  sequencing  technology  and  confirmed  by  fragment 
analysis (genotyping).  The complete agreement among results from independent forward and the reverse direction 
sequencing and fragment analysis provides the highest confidence in the assigned integer counts.  Other techniques 
were explored and there is no reason to doubt these results.  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has 
the highest confidence in its accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated.  The 
certified value of the number of CAG repeats is traceable to the SI unit of count (1). 
 
Information Values of Conventional DNA Mass Concentration:  Table 2 lists information values for the DNA 
mass concentration of the SRM 2393 components.  These values are the average of results from five quantitative 
polymerase  chain  reaction  (PCR)  methods  calibrated  with  Component  A  from  SRM  2372  Human  DNA 
Quantitation Standard.  Relatively high results from a commercial quantitative PCR method that amplifies at the 
hTERT locus were excluded from the average as this locus is sometimes over-expressed in cell line DNA [4,5].  
An information value is considered to be a value that will be of use to the SRM user, but insufficient information 
is  available  to  assess  the  uncertainty  associated  with  the  value.    Information  values  cannot  be  used  to  establish 
metrological traceability.  
 
Expiration  of  Certification:    The  certification  of  SRM  2393  is  valid,  within  the  measurement  uncertainty 
specified, until 31 January 2021, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given 
in this certificate (see “Warning and Instructions for Handling, Storage, and Use”).  The certification is nullified if 
and  Use”).  The  certification  is  nullified  if 
the SRM is damaged, contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
If 
Maintenance  of  SRM  Certification:    NIST  will  monitor  this  SRM  over  the  period  of  its  certification.    If 
ate,  NIST  will 
substantive technical changes occur that affect the certification before the expiration of this certificate, NIST will 
notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Coordination of the technical measurements leading to the certification was under the direction of M.C. Kline and 
J.M.  Butler  of  the  NIST  Biomolecular  Measurement  Division.    Evaluation  of  the  data  was  performed  by 
D.L. Duewer of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division and reviewed by J.H. Yen of the NIST Statistical Engineering 
Division.  M.C. Kline prepared the materials and performed the homogeneity and certification measurements with 
the  assistance  of  staff  from  the  divisions  formerly  known  as  the  NIST  Biochemical  Science  and  Analytical 
Chemistry Divisions. 
 
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Office  of  Reference 
Materials.

SRM 2393 

WARNING AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
Handling:    SRM  2393  IS  A  HUMAN-SOURCE  MATERIAL.    SINCE  THERE  IS  NO  CONSENSUS  ON  THE 
INFECTIOUS STATUS OF  EXTRACTED DNA, HANDLE THE SRM 2393 COMPONENTS AS BIOSAFETY 
LEVEL 1 MATERIALS CAPABLE OF TRANSMITTING INFECTIOUS DISEASE [6].  SRM 2393 components 
and derived solutions should be disposed of in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations. 
 
IZE. 
Storage:  All vials of SRM 2393 should be stored in the dark between 2 °C to 8 °C.  DO NOT FREEZE. 
 
Use:    Component  vials  should  be  mixed  briefly  and  centrifuged  (without  opening  the  vial  cap)  prior  to  removing 
sample  aliquots  for  analysis.    For  the  certified  and  informational  values  to  be  applicable,  materials  should  be 
withdrawn  immediately after  opening  the  vials and processed  without delay.  Dilutions  of these  materials  may be 
made as appropriate, but they must be used immediately.  Certified and information values do not apply to any material 
remaining in recapped vials.  DO NOT EXPOSE ANY DNA SOLUTION TO DIRECT SUNLIGHT.

Sample  Preparation:    DNA  extracts  from  the  National  Institute  of  General  Medical  Sciences  (NIGMS)  
Human  Genetic  Cell  Repository,  Inherited  Disorders  subcollection  [7]  were  purchased  from  Coriell 
Institute 
in 
deionized  water  with  10  mmol/L  2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol  hydrochloride  (Tris  HCl)  and 
to 
0.1  mmol/L 
pH 8.0 (TE-4, pH 8.0 buffer).  After concentration adjustment the materials were allowed to equilibrate at 4 °C in PFA 
containers until vialing.  Just prior to vialing, each material was brought to room temperature in its PFA container 
inside a laminar flow hood and gently mixed.  In separate sessions, each solution was transferred with a manual pipette 
to sterile PFA vials, which were then capped and labeled. After the production run for that component was complete, 
all vials were placed into storage at 4 °C. 
 
Material Qualification:  Figure 1 displays electropherograms of the PCR amplification products at the Huntington’s 
Disease locus for components A to F.  Peaks for stutter products for one or more [CAG] repeat units less than the 
certified value (“reverse stutter”) and one repeat more than the certified value (“forward stutter”) are visible for alleles 
15, 17, 29, 35, 36, 39, 40, and 45.  There are two forward stutter peaks visible  for the 50 allele and three for the 
75 allele.  Since genomic DNA rather than PCR products are supplied the stutter amounts may differ depending on 
user PCR conditions.  PCR amplifications of the Huntington’s Disease locus with more severe stutter than shown here 
can produce reverse stutter peaks that have greater height and area than the parent allele.  The extent of both reverse 
and forward stutter increases with increasing number of [CAG] repeats.

Figure  1.    Example  electropherograms  of  SRM  2393  components.    The  y-axis  represents  relative 
fluorescence units (RFUs).  The RFU scale for the 75 repeat allele of Component F has been expanded to 
facilitate  visualization of the “stutter” pattern and is not shown.    The  x-axis  represents  base  pair  size  as 
estimated from an internal size standard.  Values below the x-axis line are the number of [CAG] repeats 
for  PCR  products  having  peak  heights  of  50  RFU  or  more.    The  parent  allele  in  each  set  of  PCR 
amplification products is marked with a “”. 

 
Measurement of [CAG] Repeat Number:  Both alleles for each component were sequenced in both forward and 
reverse directions or in multiple forward directions using Big Dye v 3.1 Sanger sequencing chemistry and capillary 
electrophoresis [8].  The number of [CAG] repeat units were counted.  The counts were confirmed by genotyping 
the components and evaluating the relationships between the count and the apparent electrophoretic size of the PCR 
products and between the count and the peak area fraction of stutter products relative to the peak area of the parent 
allele. 
 
f  relative  peak  areas  of  the  PCR
Homogeneity Assessment:  Material homogeneity was evaluated by comparison of relative peak areas of the PCR 
products at the Huntington’s Disease locus.  Five vials of each component were randomly selected and analyzed in 
duplicate. 

 
Commutability  of  the  Huntington’s  Disease  CAG  repeat  Certified  Values:    The  commutability  of  the 
SRM 2393 components was evaluated by two independent European HD Registry reference laboratories [9].
