Certificate of Analysis
Standard Reference Material® 2214

Isooctane
(2, 2, 4-Trimethylpentane)
Liquid Density

This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended for use as a calibration material for densimeters.  SRM 2214 is
a high purity liquid isooctane characterized for density, ρ(T), in the temperature range of 15.000 °C to 25.000 °C.  A
unit  consists  of  four  flame-sealed  glass  ampoules  each,  containing  approximately  5  mL  of  isooctane.    Certified
values and uncertainties are given in Table 1 for the liquid density at three sample temperatures.

where T is in the sample temperature in °C.

Certified  Values  and  Uncertainties:    The  certified  values  are  based  on  instrumental  measurements  directly
traceable  to  a  definitive  method  for  density  determination.    The  uncertainties  are  approximate  95  %  prediction
intervals for isooctane density that incorporate standard uncertainties for random measurement variability, day-to-
day  measurement  variability,  variability  in  isooctane  density  from  ampoule-to-ampoule,  and  uncertainties  in
instrument calibration.  The true density of each ampoule of this material will lie within the associated prediction
interval with high probability at the certified temperatures.  The end points of the prediction interval are based on an
expanded uncertainty for isooctane density with a coverage factor of  k  =  2.13.    The  coverage  factor  was  obtained
from the Student’s t-distribution with 15.2 effective degrees of freedom [1].

Expiration  of  Certification:    The  certification  of  this  SRM  is  valid  indefinitely  within  the  measurement
uncertainties specified, provided that the SRM is used in accordance with the instructions given in  this certificate.
However, the certification will be nullified if the SRM is modified or contaminated.

Characterization of this SRM was performed by J.F. Houser and V.E. Bean of the NIST Process Measurements
Division.

Statistical analysis was provided by W.F. Guthrie of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division.

The support aspects involved in the preparation, certification, and issuance of this SRM were coordinated through
the NIST Standard Reference Materials Program by J.C. Colbert.

The overall direction and coordination of the technical measurements leading to certification were provided by
V.E. Bean of the NIST Process Measurements Division.

Source and Preparation of Material:  The isooctane used to produce this SRM was obtained from a commercial
source.  It was flame-sealed in glass ampoules, each containing approximately 5 mL of the liquid.

Storage  and  Handling:    The  unopened  ampoules  comprising  the  SRM  must  be  stored  at  normal  ambient
temperature.

Instructions  for  Use:    The  sample  tube  of  the  densimeter  should  be  cleaned  according  to  the  manufacturer’s
instructions.  When an ampoule is to be opened, that area of the stem where the prescored band is located (~5 mm
below the encircling metallic band) should be carefully wiped with a clean, damp cloth and the body of the ampoule
wrapped in absorbent material.  Then, holding the ampoule steady and with thumb and forefinger grasping the stem
at the metallic band,  minimal thumb pressure should be applied to the stem to snap it.  (Correctly done, the stem
should break easily where prescored.  Use of a metal file to break the stem is  NOT recommended.)  After opening
the  ampoule,  the  entire  contents  should  be  transferred  immediately  to  another  container  and  dilutions  made  in
accordance with the following subsections.  The isooctane should be injected into the sample tube according to the
densimeter  manufacturer’s  instructions.    A  plastic  syringe  should  NOT  be  used  as  the  plastic  may  be  soluble  in
isooctane.

The uncertainty in results from  the interpolation equation will depend upon the uncertainty in the user’s temperature
measurements.  The standard uncertainty, uc, for the interpolation equation can be approximately expressed as

where:
sρ20 is the expanded uncertainty for the density at 20 °C from Table 1, divided by its coverage factor of k = 2.13.
ρ20 is the density at 20 °C from Table 1.
T is the sample temperature measured by the user, in °C.
s β is the standard uncertainty for the first order coefficient in the interpolation equation obtained from the regression
calculation and is equal to 1.06 x 10-7 with 6 degrees of freedom.
s γ  is  the  standard  uncertainty  for  the  second  order  coefficient  in  the  interpolation  equation  obtained  from  the
regression calculation and is equal to 3.66  x 10-8 with 6 degrees of freedom.
β is the first order coefficient in the interpolation equation.
s T is the uncertainty for the user’s sample temperature measurements, in °C.

The expanded uncertainty  U,  for  the  interpolation  equation  can  be  approximately  expressed  as  U  =  2uc,  using  a
coverage factor of k = 2 (see note after equation 3).

Using the fact that the uncertainty from the linear regression will be greatest for T = 15 °C and T = 25 °C, with the
substitution of values, the expanded uncertainty, U, becomes

NOTE:  If the uncertainty of the user’s sample temperature measurement is not based on a large number of effective
degrees  of  freedom  (>30),  then  the  user  should  replace  the  coverage  factor,  k  =  2,  in  equations  2  and  3  with  a
coverage factor obtained from the Student’s t-distribution using the methods in the ISO Guide [1].
