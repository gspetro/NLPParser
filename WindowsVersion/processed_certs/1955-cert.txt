Standard Reference Material® 1955 
 
Homocysteine and Folate in Frozen Human Serum 

liquid 

chromatography/mass 

spectrometry (GC/MS), 

 
This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  use  in  evaluating  the  accuracy  of  clinical 
procedures for the determination of homocysteine and folate (in various forms) in human serum.  It is also intended 
for use in validating working or secondary reference materials.  A unit of SRM 1955 consists of three bottles of frozen 
human serum, each of a different analyte concentration level.  Each bottle contains 1 mL of human serum. 
 
Certified  Concentration  Values:    The  certified  concentrations  and  their  expanded  uncertainties  for  total 
homocysteine (tHCY) and 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid (5MT) are listed in Table 1.  The certified concentrations of 
tHCY were determined at NIST using a combination of higher-order reference measurement procedures based upon 
chromatography/mass 
isotope  dilution  with  gas 
spectrometry (LC/MS),  and  liquid  chromatography/tandem  mass  spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) [1–3].    The  certified 
concentrations for 5MT were determined by a combination of reference measurement procedures based upon isotope 
dilution LC/MS/MS performed at NIST [3,4] and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [5].  The 
methods  performed  at  NIST  for  tHCY  and  5MT  are  recognized  as  approved  higher  order  reference  measurement 
procedures by the Joint Committee on Traceability in Laboratory Medicine (JCTLM) [6].  The certified concentrations 
apply only to serum thawed to room temperature, 20 C to 25 C (see “Instructions for Storage, Stability, and Use”). 
 
Reference  Concentration  Values:    The  reference  concentrations  for  folic  acid (FA)  and  their  expanded 
uncertainties  are  listed  in  Table 2.    The  reference  concentrations  were  determined  using  LC/MS/MS-based 
methods at NIST and CDC.  Because agreement among the methods for this low-level analyte does not meet 
NIST criteria for a certified value, the results are listed as reference values [7]. 
 
Information  Values:    CDC  provided  additional  results  for  total  folate,  5-formyltetrahydrofolic  acid (5FT), 
tHCY,  and  vitamin  B12 (cobalamin).    The  values  are  listed  as  method-specific  results  in  Table 3.    For  those 
analytes for which multiple methods were used, individual results  are provided because the different methods 
may not be measuring the same entities.  Information values cannot be used to establish metrological traceability. 
 
Expiration  of  Certification:    The  certification  of  SRM 1955  is  valid,  within  the  measurement  uncertainty 
specified, until 31 December 2018, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions 
given in the certificate (see “Instructions for Storage, Stability, and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is 
damaged, contaminated, or otherwise modified.  
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification.

SOURCE, PREPARATION, AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Source of Material:  SRM 1955 Homocysteine and Folate in Frozen Human Serum was prepared by Aalto Scientific 
Ltd. (Carlsbad, CA). 
 
Preparation of Material:  The material was prepared from a human serum master pool.  The analyte concentrations 
in the level 1 and level 2 materials were unfortified.  The analyte concentrations in the level 3 material were fortified.  
The level 2 material is equivalent to the human serum master pool.  The level 1 material was prepared by diluting the 
level 2  material  with  phosphate-buffered  saline  solution,  pH 7.04.    The  level 3  material  was  prepared  by  adding 
appropriate quantities of homocysteine and 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid to the level 2 material. 
 
ANALYTICAL METHODS 
 
Homocysteine Measurements at NIST:  Homocysteine was measured using three isotope dilution mass spectrometry 
approaches [13,9].  For the LC/MS and most of the LC/MS/MS measurements, three independent sets were analyzed.  
A set consisted of two test portions per bottle from two bottles of each of the three levels.  Each test portion was spiked 
with  a  known  amount  of  the  internal  standard,  homocysteine-d4.    After  reduction  of  the  sample  by  addition  of 
dithiothreitol (DTT), sample clean-up was performed using anion exchange solid-phase extraction.  The solvent from 
the extraction was evaporated to <50 µL and the residue was dissolved in 1.5 % (mass concentration) DTT in water.  
A commercial LC/MS/MS instrument with an electrospray ionization source and a triple quadrupole mass analyzer 
was  used  for  the  analysis.    The  LC  separations  were  carried  out  using  a  commercial  pentafluorophenyl 
column (25 cm × 4.6 mm, 5 µm particle diameter)  with  an  isocratic  mobile  phase  at  a  flow  rate  of  0.5 mL/min.  
Electrospray ionization in the positive mode was used with selected ion monitoring to measure the [M + H]+ ions at 
m/z 136  and  m/z 140  for  homocysteine  and  homocysteine-d4,  respectively.    Selected  reaction  monitoring  of  two 
transitions were carried out at m/z 136 → m/z 90 and m/z 136 → m/z 118 for homocysteine and m/z 140 → m/z 94 and 
m/z 140 → m/z 122  for  homocysteine-d4  on  the  same  samples.    Analyte  concentrations  were  calculated  by  linear 
interpolation from calibration curves constructed independently for each set of samples.  Three additional sets, each 

                                                           

(1)Certain  commercial  equipment,  instruments  or  materials  are  identified  in  this  certificate  to  adequately  specify  the 
experimental procedure.  Such identification does not imply recommendation or endorsement by the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the purpose.

consisting of two aliquots from one vial of each level, were prepared for LC/MS/MS measurements following NIST 
5MT Method 3 [3] described below with measurements using the MS/MS conditions described above. 
 
For measurements using GC/MS, three independent sets were analyzed.  A set consisted of two test portions per bottle 
from two bottles of each of the three levels.  Each test portion was spiked with a known amount of the internal standard, 
homocystine-d8.  DTT in sodium hydroxide solution was used to break disulfide bonds and release homocysteine and 
homocysteine-d4, which were then isolated by absorption on anion exchange resin, followed by elution, concentration, 
derivatization with N-methyl-N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide (MTBSTFA), and GC/MS with selective 
ion  monitoring.    The  GC/MS  measurements were  performed  using  a  mass  selective  detector  with  two  different 
30-meter capillary columns (one with a 5 % (mole fraction) phenylmethylpolysiloxane stationary phase, the other with 
50 % phenylmethylpolysiloxane).  Two different pairs of ions (m/z 420/424 and m/z 318/322) were monitored. 
 
Homocysteine Measurements at CDC:  CDC used two methods to measure homocysteine.  These data  were not 
used to calculate  the certified values, but  are presented to demonstrate  the commutability of this SRM  for routine 
methods for the determination of homocysteine.  For the first method [10], total homocysteine (tHCY) was measured 
by isocratic liquid chromatography with fluorometric detection (LC-FD) at 385 nm excitation and 515 nm emission 
after  reduction  of  protein-bound  and  oxidized  thiols (disulfides  and  mixed  disulfides)  to  free  thiol  with 
tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP),  protein  precipitation  with  trichloroacetic  acid,  and  fluorescent 
derivatization with ammonium 7-fluorobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-4-sulfonate (SBD-F).  The separation of the 
obtained  thiolderivatives  was  performed  isocratically  within  7 min,  with  the  use  of  an  acetate  mobile  phase  at 
pH 5.5.  Cystamine was used as an internal standard.  Quantitation was by peak area ratio (analyte to internal standard) 
and is based on a three-point standard curve in a serum matrix.  For the second method [11], tHCY was measured by 
using an automated fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA) from Abbott Diagnostics.  In brief, DTT reduces 
homocysteine  bound  to  albumin  and  to  other  small  molecules,  homocysteine,  and  mixed  disulfides,  to  free  thiol.  
S-adenosyl-homocysteine (SAH) hydrolase catalyzes conversion of homocysteine to SAH in the presence of added 
adenosine.  In the subsequent steps, a specific monoclonal antibody and a fluoresceinated SAH analog tracer constitute 
the FPIA detection system.  Serum tHCY concentrations were calculated by the Abbott AxSym using a machine-stored 
calibration curve. 
 
Folate  Measurements  at  NIST:    For  measurements  of  5MT  at  NIST,  three  variations  of  LC/MS/MS-based 
methodology were used [3,4,9]. 
 
Method 1:  For each sample, a 500 L aliquot of SRM 1955 was spiked with [13C5]-5MT stock standard, immediately 
diluted  with  an  equal  volume  of  an  aqueous  solution  containing (mass  concentrations)  10 %  ascorbic  acid  and 
1 % ethylenediaminetetracetic acid (EDTA) and allowed to equilibrate on ice for ≥15 min.  5MT was extracted from 
samples  using  C18 SPE  cartridges:  methanol,  water,  and  1 % ascorbic  acid/1 % EDTA  solution  were  used  for 
conditioning,  95+5  water+methanol  solution  was  used  for  washing  and  1 %  ascorbic  acid/1 % formic  acid  in 
50+50 water+methanol  was  used  for  analyte  elution.    A  commercial  LC/MS/MS instrument  with  an  electrospray 
ionization source and a triple quadrupole mass analyzer was used for extract analysis.  LC separations were carried 
out  using  a  gradient  of  formic  acid  in  water  and  methanol  on  a  phenylpropyl  LC column  (3.9 mm × 150 mm, 
4 μm particle diameter).  LC/MS/MS detection and quantification of 5MT and [13C5]-5MT were conducted in multiple 
reaction  monitoring (MRM)  mode.    MRM  transitions  for  each  analyte  were  individually  optimized  for  protonated 
analyte  molecules  [M + H]+  and  stable,  protonated  fragments.    The  relevant  MRM  mass  transitions  were 
m/z 460 → m/z 313 for 5MT and m/z 465 →m/z 313 for [13C5]-5MT.  Analyte concentrations were calculated by linear 
interpolation from calibration curves constructed independently for each set of samples. 
 
Method 2:    Test  portions  were  spiked  and  equilibrated  as  with  Method 1.    Proteins  were  precipitated  with 
metaphosphoric  acid  and  the  remaining  supernatant  was  neutralized  by  the  addition  of  a  solution  containing 
0.4 mol/L K2HPO4  and  0.5 mol/L NaOH. 
  5MT  was  extracted  from  samples  using  solid-phase  affinity 
extraction (SPAE) columns:  a 1 % ascorbic acid (mass concentration) and 0.1 mol/L glycine-HCl solution (pH 3.0), 
water, and 50 mmol/L potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) were used for conditioning, water was used for washing, 
and the ascorbic acid/glycine-HCl solution was used for analyte elution.  LC/MS/MS was performed as in Method 1.

Method 3:  For the analysis of 5MT and FA, sample preparation and instrumentation were as described for Method 1.  
LC  separations  were  carried  out  using  a  gradient  of  formic  acid  in  water  and  methanol  on  a  C18 LC column 
(4.6 mm × 150 mm,  5 μm particle  diameter).    LC/MS/MS  detection  and  quantification  of  5MT/[13C5]-5MT  and 
FA/[13C5]-FA was conducted in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode.  MRM transitions for each analyte were 
individually  optimized  for  protonated  analyte  molecules  [M + H]+  and  stable,  protonated  fragments.    MRM  mass 
transitions:    m/z 460 → m/z 313  for  5MT,  m/z 465 → m/z 313  for  [13C5]-5MT,  m/z 442 → m/z 295  for  FA  and 
m/z 445 → m/z 295 for [13C5]-FA.  Analyte concentrations  were calculated by linear interpolation from calibration 
curves constructed independently for each set of samples. 
 
Folate and Vitamin B12 Measurements at CDC:  For the measurements of folates (5MT, FA, and 5FT) at CDC 
using LC/MS/MS [5], the target analytes were quantitatively isolated from 275 μL of the SRM 1955 serum using a 
phenyl  solid-phase  extraction  cartridge,  then  detected  and  quantified  in  stabilized  serum  extracts  by  positive-ion 
electrospray ionization LC/MS/MS using an isocratic mobile phase of acetic acid in organic solvent on a C8 analytical 
column.  13C-labeled folates were used as internal standards.  For the CDC microbiological assay for total folates [12], 
using a 96-well plate microtiter method, diluted SRM test portions were added to an assay medium containing all of 
the nutrients except folic acid necessary for growth of Lactobacillus casei (L. casei, NCIB 10463).  The assay medium 
was then inoculated with L. casei, and the microtiter plate was incubated for 42 h at 37 ºC.  Because the growth of 
L. casei  is  proportional  to  the  amount  of  total  folate  present  in  the  serum  sample,  the  folate  concentration  was 
quantified by measuring the turbidity of the inoculated assay medium at 590 nm in a micro plate reader.  For the CDC 
radioassay for total folates and vitamin B12, a radio-protein binding assay was used.  Test portions of the SRM were 
combined  with  the  tracers  125I-folate  and  57Co-vitamin B12.    The  mixture  was  boiled  to  inactivate  endogenous 
folate-binding proteins and to convert the various forms of vitamin B12 to cyanocobalamin.  After cooling, the mixture 
was combined with immobilized affinity-purified porcine intrinsic factor and folate-binding proteins, incubated for 
1 h at room temperature, and finally centrifuged and decanted.  The endogenous and labeled folate and B12 compete 
for the limited number of binding sites on the basis of their relative concentrations and were concentrated in the bottom 
of  the  tube  in  the  form  of  a  pellet.    The  unbound  folate  and  vitamin  B12  in  the  supernatant  were  discarded.    The 
radioactivity  associated  with  the  pellet  was  counted.    Standard  curves  were  prepared  by  using  the  pre-calibrated 
folate/vitamin B12 standards in a human serum albumin base.  The concentration of the folate and vitamin B12 in the 
SRM was calculated from the standard curve.
