Standard Cigarette for Ignition Resistance Testing 

 
This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  intended  for  use  by  test  laboratories  to  test  mattresses,  upholstered 
furniture  and  its  components,  and  thermal  insulation  for  resistance  to  cigarette  ignition  in  accordance  with 
16 CFR 1632 [1], 16 CFR 1634 (proposed) [2], and 16 CFR 1209 [3].  A unit of SRM 1196 consists of two cartons 
of cigarettes each containing 10 packs of 20 cigarettes. 
 
Certified  Ignition  Strength  Value:    The  certified  ignition  strength  value  is  given  in  Table 1.    A  NIST  certified 
value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy, in that all known or suspected sources of 
bias  have  been  investigated  or  taken  into  account. [4].    The  certified  value  and  its  uncertainty  were  obtained  by 
fitting  a  Bayesian  hierarchical  model [5]  to  the  data  using  a  binomial  likelihood  function  and  a  flat,  relatively 
non-informative prior distribution for the ignition strength of the cigarette.  Tests for cigarette uniformity carried out 
by fitting a Bayesian hierarchical model to the data did not show evidence of any significant variation in ignition 
strength day-to-day or between cases, cartons, or packs [6]. 
 
The  expanded  uncertainty  given  in  Table 1  is  reported  at  the  95 %  probability  level.    Although  the  expanded 
uncertainty of the certified value was not computed using the methods outlined in the ISO Guide [7], the results of 
the  Bayesian  analysis  can  be  interpreted  in  essentially  the  same  way  as  results  from  the  ISO  approach.    The 
expanded uncertainty, U, can be expressed as U = kuc, where uc = 1.05 % is the combined standard uncertainty, and 
the coverage factor, k = 2, is determined from the Student’s t-distribution corresponding to 60 degrees of freedom.  
Alternatively,  a  Beta (722,80)  posterior  distribution  for  the  certified  ignition  strength  also  may  be  used  for 
subsequent Bayesian uncertainty calculations.

Modification of ASTM E2187 for Measuring the Ignition Propensity of Conventional Cigarettes, June 2009. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 1196 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until  31 August 2020,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  given  in  this 
certificate  (see  “Warning  and  Instructions  for  Handling,  Storage,  and  Use”).    The  certification  is  nullified  if  the 
SRM is damaged, contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance  of  SRM  Certification:    NIST  will  monitor  this  SRM  over  the  period  of  its  certification.    If 
substantive  technical  changes  occur  that affect  the  certification before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST will 
notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
The coordination of the technical measurements leading to certification was performed by R.G. Gann of the NIST 
Fire  Research  Division.    Ignition  strength  measurements  at  NIST  were  made  by  A-M. Callsen  of  the  NIST  Fire 
Research Division.

WARNING AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE AND USE 
 
Warning to Users:  THERE ARE SUBSTANTIAL SAFETY HAZARDS ASSOCIATED WITH EXPOSURE TO 
BOTH  PRIMARY  AND  SECOND-HAND  SMOKE  FROM  CIGARETTES.    THESE  CIGARETTES  ARE  FOR 
LABORATORY USE ONLY. 
 
Handling  and  Storage:    In  general,  cigarette  test  specimens  are  to  be  protected  from  physical  or  environmental 
damage while in handling and storage.  It is important that the specimens not be crushed or deformed in any manner.  
Careful  handling  is  needed  to  ensure  that  the  specimens  are  not  contaminated  while  in  storage  and  that  they  are 
protected from degradation by insects.  Test cigarettes are to be stored in a freezer at approximately 0 C (32 F).  
The test cigarettes removed from storage prior to testing should be used within one week. 
 
Use:    The  cigarettes  are  intended  for  use  in  testing  prescribed  in  Federal  regulations  (16 CFR Part 1632, 
16 CFR Part 1209, and the proposed 16 CFR Part 1634) and in California Technical Bulletin 117 [10].  Additional 
Standards  for  which  the  cigarettes  are  intended  are  NFPA 260 [11]  and  261 [12]  and  ASTM E1352 [13]  and 
ASTM E1353 [14].  These methods describe the procedures for proper handling of the cigarettes and conduct of the 
testing.    For  use  in  a  test  method,  cigarettes  should  be  conditioned  as  specified  in  that  test  method.    If  there  is 
insufficient information on conditioning, the cigarettes should be conditioned as specified in ASTM E2187-09. 
 
Material Selection and Packaging(1):  Federal regulations for smoldering ignition of mattresses and mattress pads 
(16 CFR 1632),  cellulosic  insulation  (16 CFR 1209),  and  a  draft  proposed  rule  for  upholstered  furniture 
16 CFR 1634,  proposed)  specify  a  standard  cigarette  ignition  source.    These  regulations  are  promulgated  by  the 
Consumer  Product  Safety  Commission (CPSC).    In  the  past,  the  test  cigarette  specification  was  met  by  a 
conventional, unfiltered commercial cigarette.  These cigarettes had been characterized by their physical properties.  
Their ignition propensity was determined to be the strongest of the contemporaneous brands, but was not quantified.  
In  February 2008,  that  cigarette's  manufacturer  ceased  production  of  the  conventional  version  in  order  to  comply 
with “fire-safe" cigarette legislation in various markets across the country. 
 
The  fire  safety  of  upholstered  furniture  and  mattresses  had  improved  markedly  since  the  initiation  of  cigarette 
ignition resistance testing in the 1970s.  Thus, a replacement ignition source was needed.  Under CPSC sponsorship, 
NIST modified ASTM E 2187 to enable measurement of the ignition propensity of the current test cigarettes (CTC) 
and made such measurements.  NIST then solicited proposals from manufacturers to develop SRM 1196 cigarettes 
as  a  close  approximation  to  the  CTC  in  physical  properties  and  test  results.    The  contract  was  awarded  to  Altria 
Client Services (ACS) of Richmond, VA.  ACS manufactured several prototypes, which were evaluated by NIST.  
This  process  led  to  a  design  that  was  a  satisfactory  replica  of  the  CTC.    ACS  then  manufactured  the  candidate 
standard cigarettes and submitted them to NIST.  The packs and cartons were printed to NIST specifications at the 
factory. 
 

 

                                                           

(1)Certain  commercial  equipment,  instruments  or  materials  are  identified  in  this  certificate  to  adequately  specify  the

Standards and Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the
