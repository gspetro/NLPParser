distributed by NIST on behalf of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Vienna, Austria.   Each RM unit 
consists of 20 mL water in a sealed glass ampoule.  Sinc e only very limited quantities of  these materials exist, the 
distribution is limited to one unit of each per three-year period of time.  
 
The use of VSMOW and SLAP in different laboratories a
oxygen isotope ratio data which are comparable worldwide  [1,2].  GISP, with its isotopic composition intermediate 
to VSMOW and SLAP, is considered to be a secondary reference material.  For the effects of the normalized δ-scale 
on GISP values, see the relevant IAEA interlaboratory comparison program reports [3,4]. 
 
Sample Preparation: 
Oceanography, La Jolla, CA.  Distilled ocean water was mi xed with small amounts of other water collected in the 
Pacific Ocean in July 1967 at latitude 0 ° and longitude 180 ° in order to adjust its isotopic composition as closely as 
possible to that of Standard Mean Ocean Water (SMOW) [1,2 ].  SLAP was obtained from a South Pole firn sample 
collected by E. Picciotto, Univ ersité Libre de Bruxelles, at Plateau Stat
prepared by W. Dansgaard, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark from a sample of Greenland firn [6]. 
 
Expiration of Reference Values:   The reference values for the isotopic composition of RM 8535, RM 8536, and 
RM 8537 are valid indefinitely, provided they are handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given in 
this report, (see “Instructions for Us e”).  This certification is nullified if 
the SRM is contaminated, or the glass 
ampoule container is damaged.    
 
Maintenance of Reference Values:   The isotopic compositions of these RM s are monitored on a yearly basis.  If 
substantive changes occur to the values, NIST will notify the purchaser.  Return of the attached registration card will 
facilitate notification.  
 
Technical coordination for these RMs was provided by R.D. Vocke, Jr., of the NIST Analytical Chemistry Division.   
 
The support aspects involved  in the issuance of these RMs was coordinated through the NIST Standard Reference 
Materials Program by B.S. MacDonald of the NIST Measurement Services Division.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 
 
Storage:   It is recommended that each of these RMs be stor
position inside the original container supplied by NIST. 
 
Handling:  Each RM ampoule should be used immediately after opening to avoid evaporation and isotopic 
exchange with atmospheric water vapor.  Users are strongly advised to prepare their own internal standard s for daily 
use and calibrate those standards against these RMs.  In case not all the RM material is used up completely for the 
calibration after opening the glass ampoule, the remaining quantity of original RM can be transferred immediately to 
small, dry, glass vials with conical plastic insert caps to prevent evaporation.  Each vial should be weighed 
immediately after closure for monitoring long-term evaporation losses by water vapor diffusion thro ugh the plastic 
stopper and thus to prove functionality of the material.  Any quantity of a RM already used for isotopic 
measurements should NOT be used again for this purpose since the isotopic signature will have been altered during 
the measurement. 
 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS 
 
Homogeneity:  The two standards, VSMOW and SLAP, were prepared following a recommendation of an Advisory 
Group Meeting convened by the IAEA in 1966 [5].  VSMOW was obtained by mixing distilled ocean water with 
small amounts of other water and has been distributed by the IAEA since 1968.  According to control analyses made 
by Craig, VSMOW has the same  18O/16O-ratio as the defined SMOW, but a slightly lower  2H/1H-ratio (0.2 ‰) that 
lies within the analytical measurement uncertainty of most laboratories.  About 30 L of VSMOW were stored in 
10 L storage flasks in the IAEA Laboratory, Vienna, Austria; an additional 20 L were stored at NIST (forme
NBS), Gaithersburg, MD.  RM 8535 VSMOW, RM 8536 GISP, and RM 8537 SLAP are distributed in 20 mL 
ampoules.  The isotopic homogeneity of  the different charges and of the filli ng procedure have been cross-checked 
before distribution.  These checks revealed identical values within the experimental uncertainty .  In some ampoules 
and in one 10 L primary storage flask of the U.S. (NIST) supply of VSMOW, bright orange matte r (possibly algae) 
had been observed.  However, NIST measurements showed that, within the experimental uncertainty, th e algae does 
not affect the isotopic composition [7]. 
 
Normalization:  The δ-values are stated, and should always be reported, in parts per thousand difference [‰] from 
the VSMOW isotope-ratio calibration standard. 
 The adoption of VSMOW as zero of the  δ scale and of prefixed 
values for SLAP corresponds with the definition of the δ value normalized on the VSMOW-SLAP scale [3]:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
where  R 
 
 
This  δ-definition of Equation (1) coincides with the classical one [1] only if 
measured ratio RSLAP, corresponds exactly to recommended value δSLAP. 
 
Recommended Reference Material Values:   Table 1 shows the recommended  δ 2HVSMOW and  δ 18OVSMOW values 
for RM 8535 VSMOW, RM 8536 SLAP, and RM 8537 GISP.  The GISP value is based on the VSMOW/SLAP 
scale.  It is the statistically evaluated result of data

Isotope Abundance of VSMOW:  VSMOW is the isotopic standard to which GISP, SLAP, and most other oxygen-
bearing substances are compared [8 ].  Due to the definition of the 
δ scale, the  δ value of VSMOW equals zero.  
Table 2 lists the absolute hydrogen  and oxygen isotope abundance of VSMO W and the calculated atom percent of 
1H or 16O, respectively.  The quoted uncertainties include one of the measurements and that of the absolute values of 
the calibration mixtures.  Values in parentheses are calculated.   NOTE:  “mass spec.” stands for mass spectrometric  
measurement; “FT-NMR” stands for Fourier-Transform Nuclear Magnetic Resonance.

Isotope Abundance of SLAP:  The oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratio scales are defined in terms of VSMOW and 
SLAP such that the hydrogen and oxygen composition of SLAP relative to VSMOW is -428 ‰ and -55.5 ‰, 
respectively.  These  δ values for SLAP were conventionally fixed at the IAEA Consultants Meeting on Stable 
Isotope Standards in 1976, Vienna, Austria, on the basis of a data set achieved in an interlaboratory comparison [5]. 
Participating scientists and laboratories included in the measurement of SLAP and the reported  δ values are given in 
reference 14.  Table 3 gives values for the absolute hydrogen and oxygen isotope abundance of SLAP, the calculated 
atom percent of  1H or  18O, and the calculated  δ values, respectively.  The quoted  uncertainties in clude one of the 
measurements and that of the absolute values of the calibration mixtures.  Values in parentheses are calculated.

Isotope Abundance of GISP:   The isotopic composition of GISP has been determined in two interlaboratory 
comparison exercises [3,16].  The re ported final consensus values relative to VSMOW and normalized on the 
VSMOW/SLAP scale are given in Table 4.   Intercalibration average values of  the accepted data, standard deviation 
(1σ) and standard uncertainty (1σ/√ n) of GISP were reported to the IAEA in 1984 and 1995.  Data in first row:  data 
within the 2 σ-range of all reported values have been accepted [5];  data in second row:  va lues are the results of a 
two step statistical treatment [16]; data in third row:  statistical re-evaluation of both data sets [5] and [16],

Information Values:   The absolute maximum density of VSMOW is 999.975 kg/m 3 [18].  The tritium activity 
± 3.6 TU  on  16 September 
concentration of VSMOW, determined at the IAEA by direct gas counting, was 18.5 
1976.  The tritium activity concentration of SLAP was 374  ± 9 TU on 16 September 1976.  Both values are reported 
with their standard deviation (1 σ).  The  17O/16O ratios of GISP and SLAP have been determined in six individual 
measurements each [19].  The reported  δ17O values [‰] on the VSMOW/SLAP scale are -12.71 ‰  
0.05) ‰ for GISP and -28.86 ‰  ± (0.03 to 0.12) ‰ for SLAP.  The numbers in parentheses give the range of the 
standard deviation of the individual measurements.  The extended uncertainty is reported to be ± 0.1 ‰.
