validation  of 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended primarily for validation of methods for determining vitamins, 
vitamins, 
elements, proximates, fatty acids, and amino acids in soy milk and similar materials.  This SRM can also be used for 
quality  assurance  when  assigning  values  to  in-house  reference  materials.    The  SRM  is  a  soy  milk  prepared  by  a 
commercial manufacturer.  A unit of SRM 3235 consists of 10 ampoules, each containing approximately 10 mL of 
material. 
 
The  development  of  SRM 3235  was  a  collaboration  between  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology 
(NIST) and the National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements (NIH-ODS). 
 
Certified  Mass  Fraction  Values:    The  certified  mass  fraction  values  for  elements  and  vitamins  in  SRM 3235, 
reported on an as-received basis, are provided in Tables 1 and 2.  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST 
has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or 
taken  into  account [1].    Analyses  for  value  assignment  were  performed  by  NIST  and  collaborating  laboratories.  
Certified values were calculated as the mean of the mean values from NIST methods and the median or mean of the 
means of results provided by collaborating laboratories, where appropriate.  The associated uncertainties are expressed 
at an approximately 95 % level of confidence [2–4]. 
 
Reference  Mass  Fraction  Values:  Reference  mass  fraction  values  for  iron,  additional  vitamins,  proximates  and 
calories,  fatty  acids,  and  amino  acids  in  SRM 3235,  reported  on  an  as-received  basis,  are  provided  in  Tables 3 
through 7.  A NIST reference value is a noncertified value that is the best estimate of the true value based on available 
data;  however,  the  value  does  not  meet  the  NIST  criteria  for  certification [1]  and  is  provided  with  associated 
uncertainties that may reflect only measurement reproducibility, may not include all sources of uncertainty, or may 
reflect a lack of sufficient statistical agreement among multiple analytical methods.  The reference mass fraction values 
were derived from results reported by NIST and/or collaborating laboratories. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 3235 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until  01 October 2026, provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  given  in  this 
certificate (see “Instructions for Storage and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, 
or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Support for the development of SRM 3235 was provided in part by NIH-ODS.  Technical consultation was provided by 
J.M. Betz of NIH-ODS.  
 
Overall direction and coordination of the technical measurements leading to the certification of this SRM were performed 
by M.M. Phillips and L.J. Wood of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division and K.E. Sharpless of the NIST Special Programs 
Office. 
 
Analytical  measurements  at  NIST  were  performed  by  J.F. Browning,  C.Q. Burdette,  K.D. Chieh,  B.E. Lang,

NOTICE AND WARNING TO USERS 
 
SRM 3235 IS INTENDED FOR RESEARCH USE, NOT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE AND USE 
 
5 
Storage:    The  original  unopened  ampoules  of  SRM 3235  should  be  stored  under  refrigeration  (4 °C).    Once  the 
only 
ampoule is opened, the long-term stability of all analytes in SRM 3235 is unknown.  Therefore, the certification only 
days 
applies to the initial use and the same results are not guaranteed if the remaining liquid is used longer than two days 
after opening. 
 
Use:  Prior to removal of a test portion for analysis, the contents of an ampoule of material should be mixed thoroughly.  
For certified values to be valid, a 4 g to 5 g test portion should be used for analysis.  Results obtained in analyses 
should  include  their  own  estimates  of  uncertainty  and  can  be  compared  to  the  certified  values  using  procedures 
described in reference 5. 
 
SOURCE, PREPARATION, AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Source  and  Preparation:    The  SRM  is  a  soy  milk  prepared  by  a  commercial  manufacturer.    The  product  was 
as 
packaged into single-use, 10-mL glass ampoules, each containing 10 mL of liquid. 
 
Analytical Approach for Determination of Elements:  Value assignment of the mass fractions of the elements in 
SRM 3235  was based on the  combination of results  from  NIST and collaborating laboratories,  where appropriate.  
NIST provided measurements by using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). 
 
NIST Analyses for Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, P, and Zn Using ICP-OES:  Mass fractions of calcium, copper, iron, 
magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, and zinc were measured by ICP-OES.  Duplicate 5 g test 
portions were taken from each of 10 ampoules of SRM 3235 and were digested in a microwave sample preparation 
system using nitric acid.  Quantitation was based on the method of standard additions using SRM 3100 series single 
element standard solutions. 
 
Analytical Approach for Determination of Vitamins:  Value assignment of the mass fractions of the vitamins in 
SRM 3235  was based on the  combination of results  from  NIST and collaborating laboratories,  where appropriate.  
NIST  provided  measurements  by  using  isotope  dilution (ID)  with  liquid  chromatography (LC)  and  tandem  mass 
spectrometry (MS/MS) or LC with absorbance or fluorescence detection. 
 
riboflavin,
NIST Analyses for Riboflavin, Pantothenic Acid, and Pyridoxine Using ID-LC-MS/MS:  Mass fractions of riboflavin, 
pantothenic acid, and pyridoxine were measured by ID-LC-MS/MS in duplicate 4.5 g test portions taken from each 
of ten ampoules of SRM 3235.  The analytes and internal standards were extracted into ammonium acetate at pH 2.6 
for analysis by positive ion mode ID-LC-MS/MS.  A gradient method with an ammonium formate buffer/methanol 

                                                           

(1) Certain  commercial  equipment,  instruments  or  materials  are  identified  in  this  certificate  to  adequately  specify  the 
experimental procedure.  Such identification does not imply recommendation or endorsement by the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the purpose.

mobile phase and a C18 column were used for ID-LC-MS/MS determination of the vitamins.  Calibrants were prepared 
gravimetrically at levels intended to approximate the levels of the vitamins in the SRM following extraction.  The 
purity  of  neat  calibrant  materials  was  determined  at  NIST  using  LC-absorbance,  Karl  Fischer  titration, 
thermogravimetric analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry.  A single internal standard solution was used for 
the calibrants and samples.  The analyte and internal standard transitions monitored for ID-LC-MS/MS are listed in 
Table 8. 
 
measured 
NIST Analyses for Vitamin D2 Using ID-LC-MS/MS:  The mass fraction of vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) was measured 
in duplicate 5 g test portions taken from each of ten ampoules of SRM 3235.  Vitamin D3-13C5 was added as an internal 
standard.  Prior to extraction, the samples of SRM 3235 were sonicated with 1 % ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid 
(mass fraction) for 1 h.  Dipotassium oxalate solution (35 %, mass fraction) was added to each sample, and the analyte 
and internal standard were extracted into 5:7 tert-butylmethylether:petroleum ether (volume fraction) by rotational 
agitation for 1 h.  The samples were centrifuged, the supernatants were decanted, and an additional aliquot of 5:7 tert-
butylmethylether:petroleum ether (volume fraction) was added.  Samples were extracted further by a combination of 
sonication and rotary mixing, then centrifuged, and the supernatants combined with those from the previous extraction.  
Two additional cycles of sonication and rotary mixing were conducted, for a total of four extractions.  The pooled 
organic layers were dried using magnesium sulfate, and following centrifugation evaporated to dryness under nitrogen.  
The  analytes  were  derivatized  with  4-phenyl-1,2,4-triazoline-3,5-dione  (PTAD)  and  reconstituted  in  ethanol 
containing butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) for analysis by positive-ion mode LC-MS/MS.  A gradient method with 
a  water/methanol  mobile  phase  and  a  pentafluorophenyl  column  were  used  for  LC-MS/MS  determination.  
Vitamin D2+PTAD  and  vitamin  D3-13C5+PTAD  were  measured  at 
transitions  m/z 572  m/z 298  and 
m/z 565  m/z 298,  respectively.    Calibrants  were  prepared  gravimetrically  at  levels  intended  to  approximate  the 
levels of the vitamins in the  SRM  following extraction.  The purity of the  neat  vitamin  D2 calibrant  material  was 
determined at NIST using spectrophotometry at 265 nm (molar extinction coefficient of 19,400 L mol-1cm-1).  A single 
internal standard solution was used for the calibrants and samples. 
 
NIST Analyses for Tocopherols Using Liquid Chromatography with Fluorescence Detection:  Mass fractions of δ-
tocopherol and γ-tocopherol were measured in duplicate 3 g to 5 g test portions taken from each of ten ampoules of 
SRM 3235.  Ethanolic tocol was added as an internal standard.  Prior to extraction, the sample was suspended in water 
and dipotassium oxalate solution (35 %, mass fraction) was added.  The analytes and internal standard were extracted 
from the sample into 10:5:7 ethanol:tert-butylmethylether:petroleum ether (volume fraction) by rotational agitation 
for 15 min.  The samples were centrifuged, the supernatants were decanted, and an additional aliquot of ethanol:tert-
butylmethylether:petroleum ether  was added.  Samples  were extracted further by 15 min of mixing/rotation.  Two 
additional cycles of sonication were conducted, for a total of four extractions.  The pooled organic layers were washed 
twice with water, evaporated to dryness under nitrogen, and resuspended in a mixture of ethanol and ethyl acetate for 
analysis by LC-fluorescence.  An isocratic method with a water/methanol mobile phase and a C30 column were used 
for  LC-fluorescence  determination.    The  separation  was  monitored  using  a  fluorescence  detector  at  an  excitation 
wavelength of 295 nm and an emission wavelength of 330 nm.  Calibrants were prepared gravimetrically at levels 
intended to approximate the levels of the tocopherols in the SRM following extraction.  The purity of the δ-tocopherol 
calibrant material was determined at NIST using spectrophotometry at 297 nm (molar extinction coefficient of 3,762 L 
mol-1cm-1)  in  combination  with  LC-absorbance  at  297  nm.    The  purity  of  the  γ-tocopherol  calibrant  material  was 
determined  at  NIST  using  spectrophotometry  at  298  nm  (molar  extinction  coefficient  of  3,808  L  mol-1cm-1)  in 
combination  with  LC-absorbance  at  297  nm.    A  single  internal  standard  solution  was  used  for  the  calibrants  and 
samples. 
 
of
NIST  Analyses  for  Tocopherols  Using  Liquid  Chromatography  with  Absorbance  Detection:    Mass  fractions  of 
δ-tocopherol  and  γ-tocopherol  were  measured  in  duplicate  5 g  test  portions  taken  from  each  of  six ampoules  of 
SRM 3235.  Ethanolic tocol was added as an internal standard.  The analytes and internal standard were extracted 
from  the  sample  into  hexane  by  sonication  for  1 h  followed  by  overnight  rotational  agitation.    The  samples  were 
centrifuged, the supernatants were decanted, and an additional aliquot of hexane was added.  Samples were extracted 
further by 2 h of sonication.  One additional cycle of sonication was conducted, for a total of three extractions.  The 
pooled  organic  layers  were  evaporated  to  dryness  under  nitrogen  and  resuspended  in  ethanol  containing  BHT  for 
analysis by LC-absorbance.  An isocratic method with a water/methanol mobile phase and a C30 column were used 
for LC-absorbance determination.  The separation was monitored using an absorbance detector at 298 nm.  Calibrants 
were prepared gravimetrically at levels intended to approximate the levels of the tocopherols in the SRM following 
extraction.  The purity of the calibrant materials was determined at NIST using LC-absorbance at 297 nm.  A single 
internal standard solution was used for the calibrants and samples. 
 
Collaborating Laboratories’ Analyses:  The GMA FIACSG laboratories were asked to use their usual methods to 
make single measurements of fatty acids, proximates, calories, elements, vitamins, and amino acids on test portions 
taken  from  each  of  two  ampoules  of  SRM 3235.    Because  of  variability  among  data  provided  by  laboratories 

SRM 3235 

Page 3 of 8 

participating  in  this  interlaboratory  comparison  exercise,  the  median  of  laboratory  means  was  used,  with  the 
uncertainty estimated using the median absolute deviation (MAD) [6]. 
 
Homogeneity Assessment:  The homogeneity of elements and vitamins in the SRM was assessed at NIST using the 
methods and test portion sizes described above.  Analysis of the variance showed statistically significant heterogeneity 
for iron, riboflavin, ergocalciferol, γ-tocopherol, and δ-tocopherol, and the uncertainties for these values incorporate 
an additional component for possible heterogeneity.  Homogeneity of constituents measured solely by collaborating 
laboratories (e.g., proximates, amino acids) was not assessed, although the data were treated as though these analytes 
were homogeneously distributed. 
 
Value Assignment:  For calculation of assigned values for analytes that were measured only by NIST, the mean of 
the mean values from NIST results was used.  The collaborating laboratories reported the individual results for each 
of their analyses for a given analyte.  The mean of each laboratory’s results was then determined.  For calculation of 
assigned values for analytes that were measured only by the GMA FIACSG laboratories, the median of the laboratory 
means was used.  For analytes that were also measured by NIST, the mean of the individual sets of NIST data were 
averaged with the median of the individual GMA FIACSG laboratory means, as appropriate. 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values for Elements:  Each certified mass fraction value is the combined mean from the 
mean of results from analyses by NIST and the median of the means of results provided by collaborating laboratories.  
The uncertainty provided with each value is an expanded uncertainty about the mean to cover the measurand with 
approximately  95 %  confidence.    The  expanded  uncertainty  is  calculated  as  U = kuc,  where  uc  incorporates  the 
observed difference between the results from the methods and their respective uncertainties consistent with the JCGM 
Guide and with its Supplement 1, and k is a coverage factor corresponding to approximately 95 % confidence [2–4].  
The measurand is the total  mass fraction for each element  listed in Table 1.  Metrological traceability is to the SI 
derived unit for mass fraction (expressed as milligrams per kilogram) on an as-received basis.

corresponding to approximately 95 % confidence [2,3].  The measurand is the mass fraction for each fatty acid listed 
in Table 6 as determined by the methods indicated.  Metrological traceability is to the SI derived unit for mass fraction 
(expressed as grams per 100 grams) on an as-received basis.

Reference Mass Fraction Values for Amino Acids:  Each reference mass fraction value is the median of the means 
of results provided by collaborating laboratories using hydrolysis followed by derivatization and LC.  The uncertainty 
provided is an expanded uncertainty about the mean to cover the measurand with approximately 95 % confidence.  
The expanded uncertainty is calculated as U = kuc, where uc represents the combined uncertainty consistent with the 
JCGM  Guide  and  with  its  Supplement 1,  and  k  is  a  coverage  factor  corresponding  to  approximately  95 % 
confidence [2,3].  The measurand is the mass fraction of each amino acid listed in Table 7 as determined by the method 
indicated.  Metrological traceability is to the SI derived unit for mass fraction (expressed as grams per 100 grams) on 
an as-received basis.
