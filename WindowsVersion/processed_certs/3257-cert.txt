	Catechin Calibration Solutions

	

	This Standard Reference Material (SRM) consists of three separate solutions containing catechins.  
Solution 1 contains (+)catechin, (–)gallocatechin, and (–)gallocatechin 3gallate; Solution 2 contains 
(–)epicatechin, (–)epigallocatechin, and (–)epicatechin 3-gallate; Solution 3 contains (–)epigallocatechin 3gallate.  The solutions were prepared in a mixture of 30 % methanol, 70 % water, and 0.05 % formic acid (volume fractions).  Formic acid was added to stabilize the catechins.  SRM 3257 is intended primarily for use in calibration of instruments and techniques used for the determination of these analytes.  A unit of SRM 3257 consists of twelve 2 mL ampoules, four vials each of Solution 1, Solution 2, and Solution 3.  Each ampoule contains approximately 1.2 mL of solution.

	

			The development of SRM 3257 was a collaboration between the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS).

	

	Certified Values:  The certified values for the catechins in Table 1 are based on the results from the gravimetric preparation of the solutions and from the analytical results determined using liquid chromatography with ultraviolet absorbance detection (LCUV).  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [1].  Values are provided in mass fraction units and, for user convenience, mass concentrations [2].  The mass concentration was calculated from the mass fraction values using the density of the solvent, which was determined at NIST using the LangLevy pipette method [3].  An allowance for the change in density over the range 20 °C to 25 °C is included in the uncertainty.  The measurand is the value for each catechin listed in Table 1.  Metrological traceability is to the SI derived units of mass fraction (expressed as micrograms per gram) and mass concentration (expressed as micrograms per milliliter).

	

	Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 3257 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, until 15 April 2021, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given in this certificate (see “Handling, Storage, and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, or otherwise modified.

	

Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive technical changes occur that affect the certification before the expiration of this certificate, NIST will notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification.

	

	Coordination of the technical measurements leading to certification was under the direction of K.E. Sharpless and L.C. Sander of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division.

	

	Preparation and analytical measurements were performed by M. Bedner of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division.  

	

	Statistical consultation was provided by J.H. Yen of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division.

	

	Support aspects involved in the issuance of this SRM were coordinated through the NIST Office of Reference Materials.

	INTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE

	

Handling:  These solutions contain methanol and a small amount of formic acid, which are hazardous substances; therefore, care should be exercised during handling and use.  Use proper methods for disposal of waste.  The solutions are contained in tipsealed borosilicate glass ampoules with prescored stems.  Therefore, all appropriate safety precautions, including use of gloves during handling, should be taken.



	Storage:  Sealed ampoules, as received, should be stored in the dark at temperatures at or below –20 °C.  The certified values do not apply to contents of previously opened and stored ampoules, as the stability of analytes has not been investigated.

	

	Use:  The contents of the ampoule should be mixed thoroughly prior to opening.  Test portions for use should be withdrawn immediately after opening the ampoules and should be processed without delay for the certified concentrations to be valid within the stated uncertainty.  Depending on the sensitivity of the analytical method being used, SRM 3257 may be used asis or diluted.  The certified concentration values listed in Table 1 apply only to aliquots removed at 20 °C to 25 °C.  The stability of catechins in opened ampoules has not been investigated, but catechins are known to be less stable at pH values above 4 [4].



	PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS()

	

	The solutions were prepared gravimetrically at NIST from a solution of 30 % methanol, 70 % water, and 0.05 % formic acid (volume fractions) and primary standards for the catechins obtained from Blaze Science Industries (Lawndale, CA).  After preparation, the solutions were mixed for 60 min to 120 min and then stored at –20 °C overnight.  The following morning the solutions were removed from the freezer, stirred for an additional 20 min to 70 min, chilled on ice, and aliquoted into 2 mL amber glass ampoules that had been purged with argon prior to addition of the solution.  The ampoules were then flamesealed.  The masses of the standards and the total masses of the solutions were used to calculate the gravimetric concentrations.  The concentrations were adjusted for the purity estimates of the primary standards, which were determined using LCUV and Karl Fischer titration.

	

	Aliquots from 10 ampoules, selected using a stratified random sampling scheme, were analyzed using LCUV and a C18 column.  Three independent calibration solutions were gravimetrically prepared with catechin concentrations that represent the levels in each of the three SRM 3257 solutions and were used as external standards for quantitation.  Representative chromatograms and the separation conditions are presented in Figure 1.



	Certified Value Assignment:  Certified values are unweighted means of concentrations determined by gravimetric preparation and chromatographic measurements.  The uncertainty provided with each value is an expanded uncertainty about the mean to cover the measurand with approximately 95 % confidence; it incorporates Type B uncertainty components related to purity determination, components related to density (for concentration results), and expresses both the observed difference between the results from the methods and their respective uncertainties, consistent with the ISO/JCGM Guide and its Supplement 1 [5–7].  The expanded uncertainty is calculated as U = kuc, where uc is the combined uncertainty, and k is a coverage factor corresponding to approximately 95 % confidence for each analyte [5].  For all measurands, k = 2.  The mass concentrations (micrograms per milliliter) were obtained by multiplying the certified values in mass fraction units by the density of the solvent at 22 °C (0.9596 g/mL).  These concentrations are for use in the temperature range of 20 °C to 25 °C.
