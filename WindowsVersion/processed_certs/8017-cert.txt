Polyvinylpyrrolidone Coated Silver Nanoparticles 
 
(Nominal Diameter 75 nm) 

 
‘or  the  evaluation 
This Reference Material (RM) is intended primarily for use as a benchmark and investigative tool for the evaluation 
of potential environmental, health, and safety risks that may be associated with manufactured nanomaterials during 
  A  unit  of  RM  8017  consists  of  five  serum  vials  containing  a  lyophilized 
their  product  life-cycle. 
polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-coated silver (Ag) nanoparticle cake.  Each vacuum sealed vial contains nominally 2 mg 
Ag and 20 mg of PVP (molar mass approximately 40 kDa).  The RM must be reconstituted with 2 mL of deionized 
water before use; the reconstituted Ag concentration is nominally 1 mg/mL. 
 
Reference Values:  Reference values are noncertified values that are the best estimates of the true values; however, 
the values do not meet NIST criteria for certification and are provided with associated uncertainties that may reflect 
only measurement precision, may not include all sources of uncertainty, or may reflect a lack of sufficient statistical 
agreement among multiple analytical methods [1].  Dimensional values are reported in Table 1 based on the analyte 
form and method listed.  The mass of Ag in a vial is reported in Table 2.  Values for cumulative size distributions are 
provided in Table 3.  A synopsis for the methods used is provided in this report (see “Methods for Reference Value 
Measurements”). 
 
Information Values:  An information value is considered to be a value that will be of interest and use to the RM user, 
but insufficient information is available to assess adequately the uncertainty associated with the value or only a limited 
number of analyses  were performed [1].  Information values cannot be used to establish metrological traceability.  
Values and figures of interest to the RM user are provided in the “Information Values” section of this report. 
 
Expiration of Value Assignment:  The reference values for RM 8017 are valid indefinitely, within the measurement 
uncertainty specified, provided the RM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given in this report 
(see “Instructions for Handling, Storage, and Use”).  This report is nullified if the RM is damaged, contaminated, or 
otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of RM:  NIST will monitor this RM over the period of its validity.  If substantive technical changes 
ttached  sheet  or  register 
occur that affect the reference values, NIST  will notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register 
online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Coordination for the material procurement, processing, and technical measurements leading to the value assignments 
was conducted initially by R.I. MacCuspie and subsequently by J.M. Gorham and V.A. Hackley of the NIST Materials 
Measurement Science Division. 
 
Processing of the reference material was conducted at NIST by T.J. Cho, J.M. Gorham, J. Liu, and R.I. MacCuspie of

NOTICE AND WARNING TO USERS 
 
FOR LABORATORY USE ONLY; NOT FOR CLINICAL USE. 
 
HANDLING, 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
Handling and Storage:  Until required for use, the RM should be stored in the dark at room temperature in its original 
sealed vial.  The reference values reported are only valid for samples analyzed within 24 h of reconstitution.  Based 
on studies conducted at NIST, reconstituted material should be physically and chemically stable for at least 5 d (if 
stored  as  stated  below  and  not  diluted);  data  suggests  that  stability  may  extend  to  1  month  or  longer  under  these 
conditions.  Periodic monitoring of particle size by dynamic light scattering (DLS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), 
and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is recommended. 
 
Reconstituted material should be stored in the dark at temperatures from 4 °C to 25 °C and should not be subjected to 
freezing or near freezing temperatures. 
 
Use:  Remove the aluminum tear-away crimp seal, and carefully open the rubber septum capping the vial.  A small 
rush of air into the vial may be audible.  Add two milliliters of filtered deionized high purity water to reconstitute the 
suspension.  If intended for biological testing, biological grade (i.e., sterile and endotoxin free) deionized water should 
iter  should
be used.  Replace the rubber septum, and shake gently by hand for 20 s to 60 s.  Visible clumps should dissolve in less 
than 1 minute.  DO NOT SONICATE.  The lyophilized cake will self-disperse with gentle shaking and without the 
need for sonication or vortexing [2] which may cause adverse effects on the RM.  Let stand for 1 h prior to use. 
 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Material  Source  and  Processing:    RM  8017  was  prepared  from  material  obtained  from  a  commercial  producer 
(Nanocomposix Inc., San Diego, CA) in suspension form, having been formulated to NIST specifications.  Prior to 
material processing, 10 mL borosilicate serum vials that conform to USP Type I requirements were baked at >200 °C 
for >20 h, then stored under sterile conditions.  During processing, the material was aliquotted into the sterilized vials 
using an electronic pipette and sterile, pyrogen-free pipette tips, and then loosely covered using a butyl rubber stopper.  
The material was then lyophilized in the vials, back-filled with ultra-high purity argon gas, and vacuum sealed.  An 
aluminum cap was then crimped onto the vials to protect the integrity of the vacuum seal between the glass and the 
butyl stopper. 
 
Heterogeneity  Assessment:    Five  factors  were  identified  that  could  introduce  systematic  heterogeneity  during 
lyophilization  of  the  reference  material.    They  were  the  drying  process  run,  tray  number,  tray  position,  vial  row 
location, and vial column location.  Vials of the material were selected according to a sampling design that balanced 
these factors in a way that permitted a statistical test to determine whether these factors had any systematic effect on 
the material.  A total of 84 vials were sampled and 545 individual measurements were conducted using the dynamic 
light scattering method.  Each individual measurement was a mean particle size in nanometers of the particular sample.  
ANOVA tests of the five factors and their two-way interactions did not identify any significant effect at the 95 % level 
of confidence, showing that the production process did not introduce any systematic differences in the material.  A 
simple one  way  ANOVA test of differences among the 84 vials did show  heterogeneity at the 95 % significance, 
indicating that a between vial random heterogeneity is present and therefore a between vial uncertainty term is included 
in the combined uncertainty of the reference values.  For isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) measurements, 
the relative variability in the mass of Ag observed between vials is ± 0.85 % (relative standard deviation, n = 12), 
which is no greater than the variability expected for the measurement method, indicating no detectable heterogeneity 
in the mass of Ag beyond 0.9 %. 
 

 

                                                           

(1) Certain  commercial  instruments,  materials,  or  processes  are  identified  in  this  report  to  adequately  specify  the 
experimental procedure.  Such identification does not imply recommendation or endorsement by the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology, nor does it imply that the instruments, materials, or processes identified are necessarily the best available for the 
purpose.

REFERENCE VALUES 
 
Reference Values For Mean Silver Particle Size:  Analyses to assign reference values were conducted using best 
practices as determined independently  for each  method listed in Table 1.  The DLS and Ultra-Small-Angle X-ray 
Scattering  (USAXS)  measurements  yield  the  ensemble  mean  equivalent  spherical  diameter  for  a  population  of 
particles, obtained for replicate measurements on a sample or subsample for each tested vial.  The reference values 
are maximum likelihood estimations of the mean particle size based on a random effects model [3] which accounts 
for both within and between vial heterogeneity.  The expanded uncertainty, U = kuc, is calculated for the sample mean 
particle size of a randomly selected vial, where uc is intended to represent, at the level of one standard deviation, the 
combined  standard  uncertainty  calculated  according  to  the  ISO/JCGM  Guides  [4,5].    The  coverage  factor,  k  =  2, 
represents a 95 % uncertainty interval for DLS, AFM and TEM.  The coverage factor, k = 2.1, represents a 95 % 
uncertainty interval for USAXS. 
 
For AFM and TEM, a Type B component representing the uncertainty arising from the calibration artifact is included 
in this calculation.  For DLS a Type B component is derived from ISO 22412:2008, which stipulates an expectation 
of ± 2 % uncertainty relative to a monodisperse qualification standard.  For USAXS, identifiable Type B components 
were determined to be insignificant relative to Type A.  The TEM and AFM measurements yield individual sizes for 
large numbers of particles per sample (each sample representative of one vial), with each sample subsampled once 
(i.e., a subsample is a single deposition onto a substrate).  Replication was achieved by sampling multiple vials.  The 
reference  values  were  obtained  as  sample  means  and  percentiles  of  ordinary  non-parametric  two-stage  bootstrap 
samples [6] where the first stage was a random selection of one of the vials and the second stage was a subsample, 
drawn with replacement, of the measurements of the vial.

Reference Mass Value for Silver (Ag):  The measurand is the mass of Ag in a vial as determined by IDMS.  The 
reference value is metrologically traceable to the SI unit of mass, expressed as milligrams.  The uncertainty estimates 
evaluated  by  Type  A  and  Type  B  methods,  for  each  component  of  the  ID  equation,  were  combined  in  a  Kragten 
spreadsheet  [7]  using  the  law  of  propagation  of  uncertainty,  according  to  the  ISO/JCGM  Guide  [4],  to  obtain  the 
combined  standard  uncertainty.    The  expanded  uncertainty,  U,  is  calculated  as  U  =  kuc,  where  uc  is  intended  to 
represent,  at  the  level  of  one  standard  deviation,  the  combined  standard  uncertainty  calculated  according  to  the 
ISO/JCGM Guide [4].  The coverage factor, k = 1.98, used to obtain an approximate level of confidence of 95 %, is 
determined from the Student’s t-distribution with νeff effective degrees of freedom.

consideration and added to the uncertainty listed above.

indicated as determined by AFM and TEM.  The reference values are metrologically traceable to the SI unit of length, 
expressed as nanometers.  The expanded uncertainties, U, are calculated as U = kuc where uc is intended to represent, 
at  the  level  of  one  standard  deviation,  the  combined  standard  uncertainty  calculated  according  to  the  ISO/JCGM 
Guides [4,5].  A Type B component representing the uncertainty arising from the calibration artifact is included in this 
calculation.  The coverage factor, k = 2, represents a 95 % uncertainty interval.

METHODS FOR REFERENCE VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
 
Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM):  Reconstituted samples from 19 randomly selected vials  were immobilized on 
3-aminopropyldimethylethoxysilane functionalized silicon/silicon oxide substrates using a procedure consistent with 
ASTM E2859-11 [8].  Undiluted liquid samples (20 μL) were incubated on the substrate for 10 min, after which the 
solution was rinsed away using filtered deionized water and subsequently dried in a clean bench using compressed air.  
Imaging in tapping mode was initiated within 6 h of deposition using a Dimension 3100 equipped with an automated 
stage and a Nanoscope V controller (Bruker AXS,  Santa Barbara, CA).    A MikroMasch calibration grating (Model 
TGZ01, Serial No. G030245, NanoAndMore, Lady’s  Island, SC)  with  a  mean  step  height  of  a  19.5 nm ± 0.8 nm 
was  used  to  verify  operation  and  calibration.    AFM  cantilevers had a nominal force constant of 42 N/m and an 
aluminum reflective coating on the detector side.    The tips were  fabricated  from single  crystal  silicon  with  a  radius 
of  seven nanometers or  smaller.    Tips were checked at specific intervals and replaced after 100 images.  Calibration 
was rechecked after 90 images for a given tip.  Gwyddion [9], a free software package, was used on the acquired images 
to correct for tip defects and to determine the average background.    Maximum particle heights were then exported and 
the background was subtracted from each image.  The low-end threshold was set to 20 nm to avoid undifferentiated 
substrate related artifacts.    A total of >22 000 individual particle measurements were included in the analysis.

Transmission  Electron  Microscopy  (TEM):    Measurements  were  conducted  using  a  JEM3010  (JEOL, 
Peabody,  MA)  equipped  with  an  Orius  CCD  camera  (Gatan,  Warrendale,  PA)  and  a  Titan  (FEI,  Hillsboro,  OR) 
equipped with a Gatan UltraScan 1000 CCD camera, both operated at 300 kV.  The pixel resolution was 1.4 nm/pixel 
and 2.8 nm/pixel for the JEM3010 and Titan, respectively.  The magnification was calibrated using a gold-shadowed 
cross grating with 463 nm line pitch (Product 607, Ted Pella, Inc., Redding, CA) following the vendor’s instructions.  
The magnification was not changed after calibration, and samples were focused using only stage height controls (fixed 
lens excitation).  After reconstitution, samples from nine randomly selected vials were prepared on three millimeter 
amine  functionalized  silicon  oxide  TEM  grids  (NG01-051B,  NanoPlus  SiO  Grid,  Dune  Scientific,  Eugene,  OR). 
Briefly, 5 μL of suspension previously diluted 1:10 in filtered deionized water was placed on the grid and incubated 
for 10 min.  The grid was covered to prevent evaporation.  Suspension was then wicked away by touching the grid 
edge using a laboratory wipe.  Then 5 μL of deionized water was placed on the grid and similarly wicked away.  The 
grid was dried with a gentle stream of compressed air and stored until needed.  Image frames were acquired within 
2 d of sample preparation from multiple, widely separated regions.  At least 15 individual locations were used within 
a selected site on each grid to acquire image frames.  Each site contained at least 1000 individual particles for analysis.  
Image frames were acquired at 2 s exposure times.  Of the nine vials, eight were analyzed using the JEOL TEM and 
one using the FEI.  ImageJ [10] was used to analyze images by thresholding, and measuring the contiguous area of 
pixels that fall within the threshold set for a particular micrograph.  The area was then used to determine the equivalent 
diameter assuming a perfectly spherical particle.  A particle size threshold of two nanometers was imposed to eliminate 
any counting of pixels arising from the speckled, amorphous background of the support grid.  Following the protocol 
recommended in Rice et al. [11], each image was visually inspected and any touching particles (i.e., agglomerates, 
overlapping  particles)  were  excluded  from  analysis,  while  particles  touching  the  edge  of  image  frames  were  also 
excluded.  Over 16 000 individual particles were included in the reference value assignment. 
 
Ultra-Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (USAXS):  Measurements were performed at ChemMatCARS sector 15-ID of 
the  Advanced  Photon  Source  (Argonne  National  Laboratory,  Argonne,  IL).(2)    This  USAXS  instrument  has  been 
described in detail elsewhere  [12].  Data were collected during two experimental runs separated by 7  months and 
generating 52 individual measurements from 19 randomly selected vials analyzed within 2 h of reconstitution.  In each 
case the sample suspension was pumped into a vertical 1.5 mm diameter quartz capillary tube and measurements were 
conducted at two separate positions on the capillary.  The beam size was 0.4 mm x 0.4 mm, and the mean sample 
thickness was 1.48 mm.  Thus, with an Ag volume fraction of ≈10–4 and a mean particle diameter of ≈70 nm, each 
USAXS measurement sampled ≈1.33 x 108 Ag nanoparticles in suspension.  The USAXS data were reduced, the blank 
(empty  capillary)  scattering  subtracted,  and  the  data  calibrated  to  give  absolute  scattering  intensity,  I(Q),  versus 
scattering vector, Q, where Q = (4π/λ) sin(Θ)/2, λ = the X-ray wavelength, and Θ = half the scattering angle.  These 
reduced and calibrated data were analyzed to provide the size distribution of the features giving rise to the measured 
scattering intensity profile in Q.  The size distribution entropy maximization algorithm, MaxEnt [13], was applied to 
extract the Ag nanoparticle volume fraction distribution and the mean equivalent spherical diameter. 
 
Dynamic  Light  Scattering  (DLS):    Backscatter  DLS  measurements  were  performed  using  a  Zetasizer-Nano  ZS 
(Malvern Instruments Inc., Westborough, MA), following the protocol previously described [14].  NIST RM 8013 
Gold Nanoparticles, Nominal 60 nm Diameter was used to evaluate and confirm proper performance of the instrument 
throughout  the  period  of  analysis.    Measurement  parameters  were  as  follows:  laser  wavelength,  633  nm  (He-Ne); 
scattering angle, 173º; number of sub-runs, 11 at 10 s each; 50 % of sub-runs with highest intensity were automatically 
rejected  as  a  dust  filter,  yielding  a  total  measurement  duration  for  analysis  of  55  s;  measurement  temperature, 
20 ºC ± 0.1 ºC; medium viscosity, 1.0031 mPa·s; medium refractive index, 1.330.  Following reconstitution according 
to the prescribed procedure, a 10 μL aliquot was extracted and diluted into 990 μL of filtered deionized water in a 
clean disposable semi-micro poly(methyl methacrylate) cuvette (1:100 dilution); this procedure was performed in a 
HEPA filtered clean bench.  Samples were allowed to equilibrate at the measurement temperature for 180 s prior to 
initiating measurement.  Using a combination of stratified random and targeted selection, 84 vials were analyzed for 
reference value assignment.  All  vials  used for TEM were  included in the DLS analysis.  For most  vials, a single 
subsample was prepared and analyzed; for a few select vials three subsamples were prepared and analyzed.  At least 
five  replicate  measurements  were  performed  on  each  subsample  and  averaged  to  obtain  the  sample  means.    The 
individual measured correlation functions were fit using the cumulants approach in compliance with ISO standards 
13321:1996 and 22412:2008, to yield the z-average mean equivalent spherical hydrodynamic diameter; the measured 
size includes the core and the PVP corona.

Isotope Dilution Mass Spectrometry (IDMS):  Silver mass was measured by IDMS using a X series II ICP-MS 
(ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) equipped with matrix tolerant (Xt) cones and operated at 1400 W.  A known 
amount of isotopically enriched 109Ag (in solution) was added to each of twelve randomly selected vials containing 
the entire reconstituted sample, and was followed by the addition of 3.5 g of concentrated, high-purity nitric acid.  The 
contents of each vial were gently swirled, taking care not to contact the rubber septum, at which point the reconstituted 
samples were observed to change from a cloudy suspension to a clear, pale yellow-colored solution.  The samples 
were  allowed  to  stand  for  at  least  1  h  prior  to  quantitatively  transferring  the  contents  of  each  vial  to  low  density 
polyethylene bottles.  Each sample was diluted to an analysis mass fraction of 3.5 ng/g 109Ag in 2 % volume fraction 
nitric acid.  The amount content of the added isotopically enriched 109Ag solution was calibrated against primary Ag 
standards  using  reverse  IDMS.    Solution  was  introduced  via  a  peristaltic  pump  into  a  low-flow  (100  µL/min) 
perfluoroalkoxy  micro-concentric  nebulizer.  The  nebulizer  was fitted to an impact-bead spray chamber cooled to 
2 °C.  Intensities for  107Ag and  109Ag  were  measured at dwell times of 10 ms each.  Measurements  were  made in 
continuous mode using peak jump data acquisition with one point per peak.  Five blocks of data, each one minute in 
duration, were acquired per sample.  Measured intensities were corrected for dead-time and the intensity ratios were 
corrected for mass bias and drift.  The mass of Ag was calculated via the isotope dilution measurement equation from 
the corrected 109Ag/107Ag intensity ratio [15].

Elemental  Impurities:    Semi-quantitative  determination  of  trace  elements  by  ICP-MS  was  intended  primarily  to 
assess the impurity content of Group IB elements copper (Cu) and gold (Au) in RM 8017 and are listed in Table 4.  
ICP-MS  was  calibrated  using  a  multi-element  calibration  solution  that  is  traceable  to  NIST  Spectrometric,  Single 
Element Standard Solutions.  SRM 1643e Trace Elements in Water was used for quality assurance.  Three replicate 
measurements were performed on a single vial of RM 8017. 
 
Endotoxin Determination:  The objective of these assays was to estimate the maximum endotoxin concentration 
present  in  RM  8017  in  its  undiluted  reconstituted  form.    For  this  purpose,  five  vials  were  randomly  selected,  and 
reconstituted  following  the  standard  procedure  outlined  in  the  “Instructions  for  Handling,  Storage,  and  Use.”  
Endotoxin  contamination  was  assessed  by  the  kinetic  turbidity  and  gel-clot  Limulus  Amoebocyte  Lysate  (LAL) 
assays.  The general protocols for these assays (STE-1.2 and STE-1.3, respectively) can be found in reference 16.  
Assays were conducted at a dilution factor of 1:1000, based on preliminary spike recovery results.  Results are listed 
in Table 4.

UV-Vis Absorbance:  Figure 2 provides a representative UV-Vis absorbance spectrum for a reconstituted RM 8017.  
The average surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peak for Ag was centered at 457 nm based on 24 measurements from 
eight vials.  Based on the Ag concentration in Table 2 and the mean SPR peak absorbance, an extinction coefficient 
ε = 79.8 mL/(mg·cm), is estimated where A = εCL, where C is the Ag concentration in milligrams per milliliter and L 
is the path length in centimeters.

labeled for Ag (457 nm) and PVP (212 nm).  

 
Single Particle ICP-MS (spICP-MS):  A quadrupole ICP-MS equipped with a micro-flow concentric nebulizer and 
an impact bead spray chamber cooled to 2 °C was utilized to quantify the  107Ag intensity in time-resolved analysis 
mode to obtain spICP-MS data on reconstituted RM 8017 diluted to Ag mass fractions of 35 ng/L to 60 ng/L on the 
order of 107 particles per liter [17].  Particle size was derived by the method described in Pace et. al. [18].  The transport 
efficiency was measured daily via the particle size method using NIST RM 8013.  Silver (Ag) standards prepared 
daily in water by gravimetric dilution of SRM 3151 Silver (Ag) Standard Solution were used to establish the intensity 
versus mass per event calibration curve.  Working suspensions were analyzed within 1 h of dilution to minimize Ag 
nanoparticle  oxidation.    Particle  pulses  were  differentiated  from  the  background  using  a  5σ  criterion.    Assuming 
spherical shape, individual pulse intensities were converted to mass via the calibration curve and then the diameter 
was calculated using the bulk density of Ag.  The dissolved Ag fraction was determined using an intensity vs. mass 
calibration curve established daily from dissolved Ag standards.  Analysis of the highly diluted working sample over 
a 24 h period indicated a non-linear increase in the dissolved fraction and a corresponding decrease in the particle size 
distribution.  The mean mass diameter of Ag particles obtained by averaging the means of four vials of RM 8017 was 
69.2 nm with a standard deviation of 0.9 nm.  A comparison of the dissolved fraction determined by spICP-MS (which 
includes ionic species plus particles smaller than 20 nm) and ID with spiked aqueous 109Ag in the reconstituted vial 
following  centrifugal  ultrafiltration  indicates  greater  variability  in  spICP-MS  results  from  vial  to  vial,  but  a  mean 
dissolved fraction (4.2 %) that is statistically in agreement with the ID results (3.0 %).  Size distributions obtained by 
spICP-MS are compared in Figure 4 with AFM, TEM and USAXS.  Data on the stability of reconstituted RM 8017 
stored at 4 °C shows minimal degradation of the Ag nanoparticles over a period of 90 d.

Asymmetric-Flow Field Flow Fractionation (A4F):  A single vial of RM 8017 was analyzed by A4F coupled to 
UV, static light scattering (LS), and dynamic light scattering detectors, with 107Ag detection by ICP-MS and the results 
are  shown  in  Figure  3.    Constancy  of  retention  time  and  peak  shape  over  1  month  suggest  excellent  stability  of 
RM 8017 following reconstitution; some variability between replicates at both time points (not shown) was observed 
and attributed to the high concentration of PVP present.  Represented as a superimposed scatter plot on the UV traces 
of Figure 3 (left panel) is the hydrodynamic diameter, Dh, measured by on-line DLS at the FWHM of the UV peaks; 
the mean Dh near the center of the peak is about 90 nm and the data are relatively constant (flat) across the peak.  
Scattering  intensity  is  highly  dependent  on  particle  size,  whereas  UV  is  weakly  dependent  on  size  and  primarily 
indicative of concentration.  The close overlap of UV and LS traces in the right panel of Figure 3 (with only a slight 
shift of the LS peak to longer retention) is suggestive of a well dispersed monomodal material.  ICP-MS traces for 
107Ag (not shown) indicate good alignment with UV and LS traces, but show that a very small quantity (on the order 
of 1 % by mass) of Ag is eluted with free PVP at very short retention times (tR ≈ 4.5 min) that increased slightly at 
1 month compared to the 1 h time point; this Ag was not quantified and the UV-Vis signature was not consistent with 
previously reported Ag species, suggesting it is ionic and/or very small reduced species, qualitatively in agreement 
with spICP-MS findings.

Figure 3.  A4F Fractograms for reconstituted RM 8017.  The left panel presents UV (400 nm) fractograms obtained 
at  1  h  (red,  solid  line)  and  1  month  (black,  dashed  line)  following  reconstitution.    The  left  panel  also  contains  a 
superimposed scatter plot of the hydrodynamic diameter, Dh, measured by on-line DLS at the FWHM of the UV peaks; 
the mean Dh near the center of the peak, at about 90 nm (right axis).  The fractograms were obtained using a 10 kDa 
polyethersulfone membrane with a 250 μm spacer in a flat channel.  The mobile phase was 0.5 mmol/L NH4NO3 in 
deionized water.  Both channel and cross flow rates were set to 0.5 mL/min, and 100 µL of undiluted reconstituted 
RM 8017 was injected during each analysis.  The reconstituted sample was stored at ambient laboratory conditions 
between analyses.  The right panel shows the UV (red, solid line) and LS (black, dashed line) traces taken 1 h after 
the reconstitution. 
 
Zeta  Potential  and  pH  of  Reconstituted  Suspension:    Within  3  h  of  reconstitution,  electrophoretic  mobility 
measurements  were  performed  on  RM  8017  diluted  1:100  (filtered  deionized  water)  using  phase  analysis  light 
scattering with a dip cell containing palladium-coated electrodes; two vials were analyzed.  Replicate measurements 
were  conducted  on  samples  from  both  vials,  and  the  mobility  was  converted  to  zeta  potential  (ZP)  using  the 
Smoluchowski equation (default setting on most instruments).  The mean ZP for the 1:100 dilution was –24 mV with 
a standard deviation of 1 mV.  A 1:10 dilution (filtered deionized water) of RM 8017 yielded a ZP of –20 mV.  The 
pH for the as-reconstituted RM 8017 in both vials was 4.3.

Figure 4.  The left side presents the complete set of particle size distributions (PSDs) obtained from 
four  techniques  (AFM,  TEM,  USAXS  and  spICP-MS).    On  the  right  side  is  the  mean  PSD 
determined by averaging all available data sets.  With the exception of USAXS, all PSDs have been 
normalized to the total counts in each data set, yielding frequency on the ordinate axis.  USAXS 
PSDs are presented as the volume fraction.  USAXS distributions are calculated using a maximum 
entropy fit and are plotted as the volume fraction of Ag per nanometer size increment rather than 
normalized frequency.
