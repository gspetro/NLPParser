This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended for use in evaluating analytical methods for the determination  
of  selected  polycyclic  aromatic  hydrocarbons (PAHs),  nitro-substituted  PAHs  (nitro-PAHs),  polybrominated 
diphenyl ether (PBDE) 
polychlorinated 
hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) 
sugars, 
dibenzo-p-dioxin (PCDD)  and  dibenzofuran (PCDF)  congeners, 
inorganic  constituents,  and  particle-size 
characteristics in atmospheric particulate material and similar matrices.  All of the constituents for which certified, 
reference, and information values are provided are naturally present in the particulate matter.  A unit of SRM 2786 
consists of one bottle containing between 100 mg and 140 mg of particulate matter. 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values:  Certified mass fraction values for PAHs, nitro-PAHs, and PBDE congeners are 
provided in Tables 1, 2, and 3, respectively.  The certified mass fraction values for selected inorganic constituents are 
provided in Table 4.  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in 
that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [1].  The certified values are 
based on the agreement of results obtained at NIST using multiple analytical techniques, or for cadmium, lead, and 
mercury, measurements performed at NIST using a single primary method.  The measurand is the total concentration 
of each analyte.  Metrological traceability is to the SI unit of mass expressed as derived unit of mass fraction. 
   
Reference Mass Fraction Values:  Reference mass fraction values are provided in Table 5 for additional PAHs, in 
Table 6  for  additional  nitro-PAHs,  in  Table 7  for  additional  PBDE  congeners,  in  Table 8  for  selected  inorganic 
constituents, in Table 9 for selected sugars, and in Table 10 for selected PCDD and PCDF congeners and the total 
tetra-, penta-, hexa-, and hepta-substituted congeners of PCDD and PCDF.  Reference values are noncertified values 
that are estimates of the true value; however, the values do not meet the NIST criteria for certification and are provided 
with associated uncertainties that may reflect only measurement precision, may not include all sources of uncertainty, 
or may reflect a lack of sufficient statistical agreement among multiple analytical methods [1].  The measurand is the 
concentration of each analyte, as determined by the methods indicated in the text.  Metrological traceability is to the 
SI unit of mass expressed as derived unit of mass fraction. 
 
Information  Values:    Information  mass  fraction  values  for  three  HBCD  isomers  are  provided  in  Table 11  and 
additional inorganic constituents in Table 12.  Information values for particle-size characteristics in Table 13.  An 
information value is considered to be a value that will be of interest to the SRM user, but insufficient information is 
available to assess the uncertainty associated with the value or only a limited number of analyses were performed [1].  
Information values cannot be used to establish metrological traceability. 
  
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 2786 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until 30 September 2026, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given in this 
certificate (see “Instructions for Handling, Storage, and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, 
contaminated, or otherwise modified.   
 
Overall  direction  and  coordination  of  technical  measurements  leading  to  certification  were  performed  by 
M.M. Schantz, R. Zeisler, S.E. Long, L.C. Sander, and S.A. Wise of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
y  aerosolized.  The  particle  size
Handling:  This material may contain constituents of unknown toxicity and is readily aerosolized.  The particle size 
of a significant portion of the material is in the range of inhalable airborne particulate matter.  Therefore, caution and 
care should be exercised during its handling and use. 
 
Storage:  SRM 2786 is provided in an amber glass bottle and should be stored away from direct sunlight at room 
temperature (25 °C) or below. 
 
Use:    Prior  to  removal  of  test  portions  for  analysis,  the  contents  of  the  bottle  should  be  mixed  thoroughly.    The 
recommended minimum sample size is 30 mg.  The concentrations of constituents in SRM 2786 are reported on a 
dry-mass basis.  The SRM, as received, contains a mass fraction of approximately 1.7 % moisture.  A separate test 
portion of the SRM should be removed from the bottle at the time of analysis and dried to determine the moisture 
content to convert the mass fraction to a dry-mass basis. 
 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Sample  Collection  and  Preparation:  This  SRM  was  prepared  from  atmospheric  particulate  material  collected 
in 2005 from an air intake filtration system of a major exhibition center in Prague, Czech Republic.  While the sample 
is not intended to be representative of the area from which it was collected, it should generally typify atmospheric 
particulate matter obtained from an urban area.  The particulate material was removed from the reusable surface filters 
and sent to NIST.  A particle suspension unit and ultra-high-volume sampler (UHVS) were used to resuspend the total 
suspended particulate matter, and the face velocity of the cyclone in the UHVS was adjusted to control the particle 
size collected on Teflon® membrane filters.  The size-fractionated particulate matter was then brushed from the filters 
and collected in a clean amber bottle with a Teflon®-lined cap.  The bottle containing the material was rolled and then 
the  material  was  aliquoted  into  clean  amber  4 mL  bottles  with  Teflon®-lined  caps.    Each  bottle  contains  between 
100 mg and 140 mg of material.    
 
 

 

                     

(1) Certain  commercial  equipment,  instruments,  or  materials  are  identified  in  this  certificate  to  specify  adequately  the 
experimental procedure.  Such identification does not imply recommendation or endorsement by the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the purpose.

Conversion to Dry-Mass Basis:  The results for the constituents in SRM 2786 are reported on a dry-mass basis; the 
material  “as  received”  contains  residual  moisture.    The  amount  of  moisture  in  SRM 2786  was  determined  by 
measuring the mass loss after freeze-drying test portions of 100 mg to 140 mg for 5 days at 1 Pa with a –20 °C shelf 
temperature  and  a  –50 °C  condenser  temperature.    The  mass  fraction  of  moisture  in  SRM 2786  at  the  time  of 
certification analyses was 1.7 % ± 0.5 % at the 95 % confidence level. 
 
PAHs, Nitro-PAHs, and PBDEs:  The general approach used for the value assignment of the PAHs, nitro-PAHs, 
and  PBDEs  in  SRM 2786  was  similar  to  that  reported  for the  recent  certification  of  several  environmental-matrix 
SRMs [2]  and  consisted  of  combining  results  from  analyses  using  various  combinations  of  different  extraction 
techniques, cleanup/isolation procedures, and chromatographic separation and detection techniques.   
 
Five sets of gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) results, designated as GC/MS (I) through GC/MS (V) were 
obtained  at  NIST.    For  GC/MS (I)  analyses,  duplicate  test  portions  of  between  10 mg  and  30 mg  from  six  bottles  of 
SRM 2786 were extracted using pressurized fluid extraction (PFE) at 150 °C with toluene.  The extract was fractionated 
using an aminopropyl solid-phase extraction (SPE) column to isolate the fraction of interest.  The processed extract was then 
analyzed  by  GC/MS  using  a  0.25 mm i.d. × 60 m  fused  silica  capillary  column  with  a  50 %  (mole  fraction)  phenyl 
thickness;  DB-17,  Agilent  Technologies,  Wilmington, DE)  and  a 
methylpolysiloxane  phase  (0.25 μm  film 
0.25 mm i.d. × 15 m fused silica capillary column with a 50 % (mole fraction) liquid crystal polysiloxane phase (0.15 μm 
film thickness; LC-50, J&K Scientific, Milton, Ontario, Canada).  The PAHs were determined on the DB-17 column using 
electron impact MS (EI-MS), method GC/MS (Ia).  The PAHs were also determined on the LC-50 column using EI-MS, 
method  GC/MS (Ib).    The  nitro-PAHs  and  PBDEs  were  determined  on  the  LC-50  column  using  negative  chemical 
ionization MS (NCI-MS), method GC/MS (Ic).     
 
For the GC/MS (II) determination of the PAHs, one test portion (100 mg) from each of six bottles was extracted using PFE 
at 100 °C with dichloromethane (DCM).  Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) on a divinylbenzene-polystyrene column 
(10 μm particle size, 10 nm [100 angstrom] pore size, 7.5 mm i.d. × 300 mm, PL-Gel, Polymer Labs, Inc., Amherst, MA) 
was used.  The fraction of interest was further isolated using an alumina (5 % deactivated) SPE column.  The isolated fraction 
was  then  analyzed  by  GC/MS  using  a  0.25 mm i.d. × 60 m  fused  silica  capillary  column  with  a  50 %  phenyl 
methylpolysiloxane phase (0.25 μm film thickness; DB-17MS, Agilent Technologies).   
 
The GC/MS (III) analyses focused on the PBDEs.  Six test portions (between 100 mg and 140 mg) were extracted using 
PFE at 100 °C with DCM.  The extracts were cleaned up using an alumina (5 % deactivated) SPE column.  SEC on a 
divinylbenzene-polystyrene column (10 μm particle size, 10 nm (100 angstrom) pore size, 7.5 mm i.d. × 300 mm, PL-Gel, 
Polymer Labs, Inc.) was then used.  This step was followed by an acidified silica SPE column step.  Two fractions were 
collected from the acidified silica column.  The PBDEs were quantified using GC/EI-MS on a 0.18 mm i.d. × 30 m fused 
silica capillary column with a 5 % (mole fraction) phenyl methylpolysiloxane phase (0.18 μm film thickness; DB-5MS, 
Agilent Technologies).  The PBDEs were also quantified using GC/NCI-MS on a 0.18 mm i.d. × 10 m fused silica capillary 
column  with  a  5 %  (mole  fraction)  phenyl  methylpolysiloxane  phase  (0.18 μm  film  thickness;  DB-5MS,  Agilent 
Technologies).     
 
For GC/MS (IV), duplicate test portions of between 10 mg and 30 mg from three bottles of SRM 2786 were extracted using 
PFE at 100 °C (for one of the test portions from each bottle; GC/MS IVa) or at 150 °C (for the other test portion from each 
bottle; GC/MS IVb) with toluene.  The extract was fractionated using an aminopropyl SPE column to isolate the fraction of 
interest.  The processed extract was then analyzed by GC/MS using a 0.25 mm i.d. × 60 m fused silica capillary column 
with a proprietary non-polar column (0.25 μm film thickness; DB-XLB, Agilent Technologies, Wilmington, DE) and a 
0.25 mm i.d. × 30 m fused silica capillary column with a 50 % (mole fraction) phenyl methylpolysiloxane phase (0.25 μm 
film thickness; DB-17MS, Agilent Technologies).  The PAHs were determined on the DB-XLB column using EI-MS.  The 
nitro-PAHs were determined on the DB-17MS column using NCI-MS.   
 
Duplicate  test  portions  of  50 mg  from  three  bottles  of  SRM 2786  were  extracted  using  PFE  at  100 °C  with  DCM  for 
GC/MS (V) determination of the PAHs.  The fraction of interest was further isolated using an alumina (5 % deactivated) 
SPE column.  The isolated fraction was then analyzed by GC/MS using a 0.25 mm i.d. × 60 m fused silica capillary column 
with a 50 % phenyl methylpolysiloxane phase (0.25 μm film thickness; DB-17MS, Agilent Technologies).   
 
For the methods described above, selected perdeuterated PAHs, perdeuterated nitro-PAHs, and fluorinated and 13C-labeled 
PBDEs  were  added  to  the  particulate  matter  prior  to  solvent  extraction  for  use  as  internal  standards  for  quantification 
purposes.  The reference mass fraction values for selected PAHs (biphenyl, dibenzothiophene, phenanthrene, anthracene, 
1-methylphenanthrene, 2-methylphenanthrene, 3-methylphenanthrene, 9-methylphenanthrene, 1,7-dimethylphenanthrene, 
and retene) were significantly higher in the extracts obtained using PFE at 150 °C compared to those obtained using PFE at 
100 °C.  The mass fraction values listed in Table 5 are those obtained using PFE at 100 °C, which is the typical temperature 
used for PFE, with the values obtained using PFE at 150 °C in footnote (h) of Table 5.

Homogeneity  Assessment  for  PAHs,  Nitro-PAHs,  and  PBDEs:    The  homogeneity  of  SRM 2786  was  assessed  by 
analyzing duplicate 10 mg to 30 mg test portions from six bottles selected by stratified random sampling.  No statistically 
significant differences among bottles were observed for the three classes of compounds at the 30 mg sample size.  
 
Value Assignment of PAHs and Nitro-PAHs:  Recent studies [3,4] on solvent extraction of other air particulate matter 
SRMs have shown that using PFE at 200 °C removes higher quantities than using PFE at 100 °C or 150 °C for some PAHs 
and nitro-PAHs.  As a result of these studies, SRM 2786 was reanalyzed for determination of PAHs using PFE at 200 °C, 
and the results were found to be equivalent to the previously assigned values.    
 
HBCDs:  The second fraction from the acidified silica SPE clean-up in Method GC/MS (III) above was analyzed by liquid 
chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) for the HBCDs using both electrospray ionization (ESI), 
Method LC/MS/MS IIId, and atmospheric pressurized photoionization (APPI), Method LC/MS/MS IIIe.  A C18 column 
(3.0 mm × 150 mm × 3.5 μm  column,  Eclipse  Plus,  Agilent  Technologies)  was  used  with  a  solvent  gradient  using 
2.5 mmol/L ammonium acetate in 12.5 % water in methanol (volume fraction) and acetonitrile at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min.  
13C-labeled HBCDs  were added to the air particulate  matter prior to solvent extraction for use as internal standards for 
quantification purposes. 
 
Inorganic Constituents Other Than Mercury:  Value assignment of the mass fractions of Cd and Pb were performed 
using isotope dilution-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ID-ICP-MS). Two 50 mg samples taken from 
each of four bottles of SRM 2786 were spiked with 111Cd and 206Pb and subjected to microwave digestion using 1 g 
of concentrated hydrofluoric acid and 9 g of concentrated nitric acid.  For Pb, a portion of the samples were heated to 
near-dryness and redissolved in 2 % (volume fraction) nitric acid prior to ICP-MS analysis. For Cd, the remaining 
sample portions were subjected to anion exchange chromatography to separate Cd from the matrix prior to analysis. 
 
Value assignment of the mass fractions of  additional inorganic constituents is based on instrumental neutron activation 
analysis (INAA) and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES).  For INAA, direct analysis of 
pellets formed from duplicate test portions (median sample size of 1.3 mg) from each of 12 randomly selected bottles of 
SRM 2786 was achieved by the comparator technique with established multielement standards.  Two sets of irradiations 
were carried out in the RT-1 pneumatic facility of the NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR).  The irradiations 
for  short-lived  nuclides  were  done  for  300 s.  The  long  irradiations  were  spaced  48 h  apart.    Irradiation  time  was 
(6+6) h  with  a  180 degree  inversion  of  the  irradiation  capsule  after  the  first  6 h  for  flux  homogeneity.  For  the 
gamma-ray assay of short-lived nuclides, measurements were done 10 min after 8 min decay.  Standards were counted 
either before or after the samples for 5 min or 10 min respectively.  For the long irradiations, the first count was 2 h 
after 3 d decay, the second count was 12 h after at least 25 d decay with counts of the standards following the sample 
counts. 
 
For ICP-OES, one 50 mg sample was taken from each of seven bottles of SRM 2786.  The samples were microwave-
digested using 1 mL of concentrated hydrofluoric acid and 9 mL of concentrated nitric acid.  Following dilution with 
water, the samples were analyzed by ICP-OES using optimized parameters for each element.     
 
Homogeneity Assessment for Inorganic Constituents:  The assessment of the homogeneity of SRM 2786 for inorganic 
constituents was based on the INAA results for the test portions from 12 bottles (median sample size of 1.3 mg).  Calculated 
elemental homogeneity factors He [5] range from 1.3 for aluminum to 10 for titanium, which indicates that SRM 2786 is 
suitable for milligram-size sampling for inorganic constituents.      
 
Mercury:  Value assignment of the mass fraction of mercury is based on isotope dilution cold-vapor ICP-MS [6-8].  Single 
subsamples (40 mg to 70 mg) were taken from each of four bottles and spiked with 201 Hg followed by microwave digestion. 
 
Sugars:    Value  assignment  of  the  mass  fractions  of  sugars  is  based  on  the  analysis  of  three  samples  (30 mg)  of 
SRM 2786  at  Texas A&M University [9]. 
  The  samples  were  extracted  using  PFE  at  100 °C  with 
dichloromethane:methanol  (9:1,  volume  fractions).    The  extracts  were  dried  and  redissolved  in  pyridine  and  then 
fraction) 
derivatized 
trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) at 75 °C for 1 h.  The sugars were quantified using GC/EI-MS on a 0.25 mm i.d. × 30 m 
fused silica capillary column with a 5 % (mole fraction) phenyl methylpolysiloxane phase (0.25 μm film thickness, DB-5, 
Agilent Technologies).  
 
Polychlorinated  Dibenzo-p-Dioxins  and  Dibenzofurans:    Value  assignment  of  the  mass  fractions  of  the  17 
2,3,7,8-substituted polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin and dibenzofuran congeners and the total tetra- through hepta-
substituted  polychlorinated  dibenzo-p-dioxins  and  dibenzofurans  is  based  on  the  analysis  of  four  test  portions 
(between 100 mg and 150 mg) of SRM 2786 by Environment Canada.  Samples were Soxhlet-extracted overnight with 
toluene.  Extracts were concentrated and solvent exchanged to hexane, then passed through a modified silica column 
followed by a basic alumina column.  The dioxin/furan fraction was analyzed by using GC with high-resolution mass

spectrometric detection (GC-HRMS) and a 0.25 mm i.d. × 60 m fused silica capillary column with a 5 % (mole fraction) 
phenyl-substituted  methylpolysiloxane  phase  (0.25 µm  film  thickness).    The  2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofuran  was 
quantified using a 50 % cyanopropylphenyl-substituted methylpolysiloxane (DB-225, Agilent Technologies) capillary 
column.  
 
Particle-Size Information:   Particle size distribution  measurements  for SRM 2786  were carried out using a laser 
diffraction instrument (Mastersizer 2000, Malvern Instruments, Southborough, MA) and the liquid suspension method 
with the instrument manufacturer’s small-volume sample dispersion unit (Hydro 2000 SM).  A suspension of 0.1 % 
(mass fraction) of SRM 2786 in distilled water with 0.001 % Triton (volume fraction), was prepared by ultrasonication 
for  1 h.    A  measurement  sequence  of  background  and  sample  measurement  was  used.    After  the  recording  of  the 
background, a portion of the suspension was added to the measurement cell to achieve an obscuration of 5 %.  Three 
passes of the sample solution were recorded and averaged.  A refractive index of 1.5 and absorption index of 0.1 were 
selected for the measurements.  Results were calculated using the General Purpose Model provided by the instrument 
manufacturer; the results obtained are shown in Figure 1.

d  uncertainty  accounts 
(a)  Reference values are based on the results from the INAA study unless otherwise noted.  The associated uncertainty accounts 
for  both  random  and  systematic  effects,  but  because  only  one  method  was  used,  unrecognized  biases  may  exist  for  some 
elements in this matrix.  The expanded uncertainty in the reference value is equal to U = kuc, where uc is the combined standard 
uncertainty and k is the coverage factor, both calculated according to the ISO/JCGM Guide [13,14].  The value of uc is intended 
to represent, at the level of one standard deviation, the uncertainty in the mass fraction value. Here uc accounts for within-
method variation and material inhomogeneity.  The coverage factor, k, is the Student's t-value for a 95 % confidence interval 
with the corresponding degrees of freedom (df = 23).
