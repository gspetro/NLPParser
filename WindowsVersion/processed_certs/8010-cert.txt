C 429 Standard Test Method for Sieve Analysis of Raw 

 
This Reference Material (RM) is intended to serve as a test ma terial in the sieve analysis of granular materials.  Each 
unit comprises a three-bottle set of sands covering three size distributions.  Each bo ttle contains approximately 130 g 
of sand, enough for the sample sizes designated in ASTM 
Materials for Glass Manufacture [1]. 
 
Six sands were obtained by ASTM Committee C-14 for use in a 1997 round robin study involving 15 participating 
laboratories to establish a precision statement for ASTM C  429.  Three of these six sands, Materials A, C, and D, 
were selected by NIST to be measured as RMs.  This
 selection was done with the objective of covering the size 
range of U.S.A. standard testing siev e numbers (No.), from No. 30 (600 µm) to No. 325 (45 µm).  Material A is a 
test material for the coarser sieves (No. 30 to No. 100),  Material C is for the midrange (No. 70 to No. 200), and 
Material D is for the finer sieves (No. 100 to No. 325). 
 
Sieve Analysis:   Fifteen laboratories provided sieve analysis of
mechanical sieving analysis was done following recommendati ons in ASTM STP 447B [2] and used a test stack of 
nine sieves:  No. 30 (600 µm), No. 40 (425 µm), No. 50 (300 µm), No. 70 (212 µm), No. 100 (150 µm), No. 140 
(106 µm), No. 200 (75 µm), No. 270 (53 µm), and No. 325 (45 µm).  The sieve testing was designed to provide 
reference values (average mass fractions)  for sieve analysis and estimates of the standard deviations for within-lab 
repeatability (s r) and between-lab reproducibility (s R).  The entire bottle of sand was poured onto the top sieve and 
the sieves were then shaken for 15 min in an automated un it.  After the shaking was completed, the stack of sieves 
was disassembled, and the sand removed from each sieve and weighed.  The mass of sand retained on each sieve 
was used to calculate the mass fraction retained on that siev e.  This is the ratio of the mass of sand retained on a 
sieve to the total sand mass.  Each laboratory reported the mass fractions to a precision of 0.1 %. 
 
Expiration:  This RM can be used indefinitely within the  measurement uncertainties specified, provided the RM is 
used in accordance with the instructions given in this report.   However, it is expected that some material will be lost 
with each use.  When the unit’s loss exceeds 2 % of the origin al mass, or if spillage or contamination occurs, use of 
the RM unit should be discontinued.

INSTRUCTION FOR USE 
 
To evaluate a set of standard 203 mm (8 in) or 305 mm (12 in)  diameter test sieves with this RM, the entire bottle of 
sand should be poured onto the top sieve screen.  The sieves
followed in routine analysis.  After the shaking has been completed, the stack of sieves is disassembled, and the sand 
is removed from each sieve and placed into a suitable weighi ng container.  To reduce loss of material during this 
step, the transfer operation should utilize a large funnel or be carried out over glazed paper to recover any spillage.  
A soft brush is useful in removing the sand from the sieve a nd funnel.  Each of the sieve fractions is weighed to a 
to the original RM bottle and kept for reuse.  The mass 
precision of 0.01 g.  After weighing, the sand is returned 
fraction retained on each sieve is compared to the reference value given in Table 1. 
 
The above procedure is for use in comparison of sieve resu lts and as a method to periodically monitor for changes in 
screens after service.  This procedure is 
complying with the calibration of wire cloth sieves

Uncertainty Analysis:  The reference values listed in Table 1 are the  average mass fraction, expressed in percent, of 
material retained on each sieve.  The uncertainties in 
according to the ISO/NIST guidelines [4], and represent  the 95 % level of confidence.  The expanded uncertainties 
are calculated as  U = ku c, where uc is the combined standard uncertainty and  k is a coverage factor. The value of  uc 
represents, at the level of one standard deviation, the co mbined effects of uncertainty due to (1) between-laboratory 
reproducibility of the sieve measurements, (2) within-laboratory repeatability of measurements, and (3) possible 
small bottle-to-bottle differences in the material.  The value of coverage factor  k ranges from 2.03 to 2.16 over the 
cases reported, depending on the calculate d effective degrees of freedom for 
operator sieving a bottle of this RM, using sieves ma

uc.  It is expected that a qualified 
nufactured in compliance with ASTM E 11-95 Standard 

Table 1 are expanded uncertainties, which are calculated

approximately 95 % of the time.  For example, it may be  expected that a No. 40 screen will retain between 16.4 % 
and 28.4 % of the original mass of Material A, at a confidence level of approximately 95 %.
