Peanut Butter 

 
determining 
This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  use  in  validating  methods  for  determining 
proximates, fatty acids, calories, vitamins, elements, amino acids, and aflatoxins in peanut butter and similar matrices.  
This SRM can also be used for quality assurance when assigning values to in-house reference materials.  The SRM is 
a creamy peanut butter prepared by a manufacturer of peanut butter products.  A unit of SRM 2387 consists of three 
jars of peanut butter containing 170 g each. 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values:  Certified mass fraction values for fat, elements, and tocopherols in SRM 2387 are 
provided in Tables 1 through 3.  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its 
accuracy  in  that  all  known  or  suspected  sources  of  bias  have  been  taken  into  account [1].   Analyses  for  value 
this  material 
assignment were performed by NIST and collaborating laboratories.  Certified mass fraction values in this material 
were calculated as the  mean  of the  mean values from NIST  methods and the  mean of the  measurements  made by 
collaborating laboratories, where appropriate.  The associated uncertainties are expressed at an approximately 95 % 
level of confidence [2-4].  Values are reported on an as-received (not dry-mass) basis in mass fraction units [5]. 
 
Reference Mass Fraction Values:  Reference mass fraction values for proximates, fatty acids, amino acids, calories, 
total dietary fiber, vitamins, and aflatoxins are provided in Tables 4 through 8.  A NIST reference value is a noncertified 
value that is the best estimate of the true value based on available data; however, the value does not meet the NIST 
criteria  for  certification [1]  and  is  provided  with  an  associated  uncertainty  that  may  reflect  only  measurement 
reproducibility,  may  not include all sources of uncertainty,  or may reflect a lack of sufficient statistical agreement 
among multiple analytical methods.  Reference mass fraction values were derived from results reported by NIST and 
collaborating laboratories.  Values are reported on an as-received (not dry-mass) basis in mass fraction units [5]. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 2387 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until 31 December 2029, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given in this 
fication  is  nullified  if  the  SRM  is  damaged, 
certificate  (see  “Instructions  for  Storage  and  Use”).    This  certification  is  nullified  if  the  SRM  is  damaged, 
contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Coordination of the technical measurements leading to the certification of this SRM was performed by M.M. Phillips, 
K.E. Sharpless, and L.J. Wood of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division and H.B. Chin, I-P. Ho, and D.W. Howell of 
the National Food Processors Association (NFPA, Dublin, CA, and Washington, DC). 
 
Analytical measurements at NIST were performed by C.Q. Burdette, C.S. Phinney, B.J. Porter, K.E. Sharpless, and 
L.J. Wood of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division. 
 
Statistical analysis was provided by J.H. Yen of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division.

NOTICE TO USERS 
 
SRM 2387 IS INTENDED FOR LABORATORY USE ONLY, NOT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE AND USE 
 
Storage:  Until required for use, the peanut butter should be frozen at –20 °C.  
 
Use:    Prior  to  removal  of  a  test  portion  for  analysis,  a  jar  of  peanut  butter  should  be  thawed  under  refrigeration 
overnight.  The contents of the jar should be  mixed thoroughly prior to removal of a test portion.  The following 
masses used for NIST analyses should be used as the minimum sample size to ensure valid results:  5 g to 7 g for 
tocopherols; 1 g for fat and fatty acids; 0.5 g for elements. 
 
SOURCE, PREPARATION, AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Source  and  Preparation:    SRM 2387  is  creamy  peanut  butter  containing  roasted  peanuts,  sugar,  partially 
hydrogenated vegetable oils (48 % rapeseed, 40 % cottonseed, and 12 % soybean oil), and salt, and was prepared for 
NIST  as  part  of  a  larger  production  run.    Raw,  shelled  Florunner  (primarily)  peanuts  were  received  from  several 
suppliers and were roasted.  The skins were removed from the roasted peanuts, and discolored peanuts were discarded.  
The roasted peanuts were then ground, and the remaining ingredients were added.  After mixing, the peanut butter 
was further ground to a fine particle size, air was removed, and the peanut butter was cooled and packed in colorless 
polyethyl tetraethylene (PETE) jars with white screw caps and foil liners. 
 
es  of  peanut 
NIST Analyses for Fat:  The mass fraction of gravimetric fat was measured from one set of three samples of peanut 
butter.  One-gram portions of peanut butter were mixed with diatomaceous earth.  The mixture was then briefly chilled 
at 4 °C to improve handling.  The fat was then extracted from the mixture by pressurized fluid extraction (PFE) using 
hexane:acetone (4:1 volume fraction).  Extracts were evaporated under nitrogen and dried at 100 °C to constant mass. 
 
NIST Analyses for Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, P, and Zn:  Mass fractions of calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, 
manganese, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, and zinc were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission 
spectrometry (ICP-OES) in eight jars of peanut butter.  Two 0.5 g portions were taken from each jar and digested in a 
nitric, perchloric, and hydrofluoric acid mixture.  Because of the high fat content, the samples were predigested on a 
hot  plate  before  digestion  in  a  microwave  oven.    Digests  were  transferred  to  plastic  bottles  and  diluted  with  the 
appropriate volume of 1.5 % (volume fraction) nitric acid.  To correct for matrix effects caused by differences between 
samples and calibrants, the method of standard additions was used; spikes were added to one aliquot prepared from 
each 0.5 g test portion.  Four measurements using ICP-OES were made and averaged for each sample and each spiked 
solution.  Results were corrected for spike recoveries.  Quantitation was based on the method of standard additions 
using SRM 3100 series single element standard solutions. 
 
with  flame 
NIST Analyses for Fatty Acids:  Mass fractions of fatty acids were measured by gas chromatography with flame 
ionization detection (GC-FID) in two sets of six samples of peanut butter prepared on two different days.  The fat was 
extracted from approximately 1 g samples of peanut butter by PFE using a mixture of hexane:acetone (4:1 volume 
fraction).  Methyl nonadecanoate (C19:0 fatty acid methyl ester [FAME]) was used as an internal standard.  A two-
step process employing methanolic sodium hydroxide and boron trifluoride was used to convert fatty acids to their

methyl esters.  FAMEs were extracted into hexane and samples were analyzed by GC-FID.  Calibrants were prepared 
gravimetrically from SRM 2377 Fatty Acid Methyl Esters in 2,2,4 Trimethylpentane at levels intended to approximate 
the levels of the fatty acids in the SRM following extraction.  A single internal standard solution was used for the 
calibrants and samples.  Calculations were based on average response factors for the calibrants. 
 
NIST Analyses  for  δ-Tocopherol  and  γ-  (plus β-)  Tocopherol:    Mass  fractions  of  δ-tocopherol  and  γ-  (plus  β-) 
tocopherol were measured using liquid chromatography with absorbance (LC-Abs) and fluorescence (FL) detection 
in  test  portions  taken  from  six  jars  of  peanut  butter  over  a  seven-day  period.    The  peanut  butter  may  contain 
β-tocopherol, but the chromatographic system described below is incapable of resolving β- and γ-tocopherol.  Samples 
of approximately 5 g to 7 g were homogenized and saponified using potassium hydroxide.  Analytes were extracted 
into a mixture of diethyl ether and hexane, which was subsequently evaporated, and the analytes were redissolved in 
a  mixture  of  ethanol  and  ethyl  acetate.    Samples  were  analyzed  by  LC  using  a  C18  column  using  a  gradient  of 
acetonitrile,  methanol,  and  ethyl  acetate [6]  and  with  absorbance  monitored  at  450 nm  for  measurement  of 
trans-β-apo-10'-carotenal oxime (the internal standard) and fluorescence excitation at 295 nm and  monitored at an 
emission wavelength of 335 nm for quantitation of the tocopherols.  Calibrants of δ- and γ-tocopherol were prepared 
gravimetrically, at levels intended to approximate the levels of the vitamins in the SRM following extraction, and the 
concentrations were assigned spectrophotmetrically.  A single internal standard solution was used for the calibrants 
and samples. 
 
NIST Analyses for α-Tocopherol:  Mass fractions of α-tocopherol were measured using LC-FL in test portions taken 
from six jars of peanut butter on a single day.  Samples of approximately 5 g were homogenized and saponified using 
potassium hydroxide.  Analytes were extracted into a mixture of ethyl acetate and hexane using rotary mixing and 
sonication, and the supernatants  from five sequential  extractions  were combined.  The solvent  from the combined 
supernatant was subsequently evaporated, and the analytes were redissolved in a mixture of ethanol and ethyl acetate.  
Samples  were  analyzed  by  LC  using  a  C18  column  using  an  isocratic  flow  of  99:1  methanol:water  and  with 
fluorescence  excitation  at  295 nm  and  monitored  at  an  emission  wavelength  of  330 nm  for  quantitation  of 
α-tocopherol,  using  tocol  as  an  internal  standard.    Calibrants  were  prepared  gravimetrically,  at  levels  intended  to 
approximate  the  levels  of  the  vitamins  in  the  SRM  following  extraction,  and  the  concentrations  were  assigned 
spectrophotmetrically.  A single internal standard solution was used for the calibrants and samples. 
 
Analyses by Collaborating Laboratories:  Data from additional sources were used for value assignment, including 
an  interlaboratory  comparison  exercise  organized  by  the  NFPA  FIACS  and  four  laboratories  participating  in  an 
exercise in which only aflatoxins were measured.  The NFPA FIACS laboratories were asked to use AOAC methods 
or their equivalent, to make single measurements from each of two jars, and to report the analytical method that was 
used.  The laboratories measuring aflatoxins were asked to use their usual methods to make single measurements in 
each of three jars. 
 
Homogeneity Assessment:  The homogeneity of elements, fatty acids, and tocopherols was assessed at NIST using 
the methods described above.  A small but statistically significant heterogeneity was found for some analytes, and an 
inhomogeneity component of approximately 5.6 % has been incorporated in the uncertainty for α-tocopherol and an 
inhomogeneity component of approximately 1 % has been incorporated in the uncertainty for all other analytes. 
 
Value Assignment:  The collaborating laboratories reported values for two to twelve analyses for a given analyte.  
The mean of each laboratory’s results was then determined.  For calculation of assigned values for analytes that were 
measured only by the collaborating laboratories, the mean of laboratory means was determined.  For analytes that 
at
were  also  measured  by  NIST,  this  mean  of  the  individual  collaborating  laboratory  means  and  the  means  of  the 
individual sets of NIST data were averaged.

Certified Mass Fraction Value for Fat:  The certified mass fraction value is the combined mean from the mean of 
results from analyses by NIST and the mean of results provided by collaborating laboratories.  The value is expressed 
as x ± U95%(x), where x is the certified value and U95%(x) is the expanded uncertainty of the certified value.  The true 
value  of  the  analyte  lies  within  the  interval  x ± U95%(x)  with  95 %  confidence.   To  propagate  this  uncertainty,  the 
certified  value  should  be  treated  as  a  normally  distributed  random  variable  with  mean  x  and  standard  deviation 
U95%(x)/2 [2-3].  The measurand is the total mass fraction of extractable fat in peanut butter as listed in Table 1 on an 
as-received  basis.    Metrological  traceability  is  to  the  measurement  processes  and  standards  used  by  NIST  and 
collaborating laboratories.

The true value of the analyte lies within the interval x ± U95%(x) with 95 % confidence.  To propagate this uncertainty, 
the certified value should be treated as a normally distributed random variable with mean x and standard deviation 
U95%(x)/2 [2-3].  The measurands are the total mass fractions of elements in peanut butter as listed in Table 2 on an 
as-received basis.  Metrological traceability is to the SI measurement unit for chemical mass fraction, expressed as

expanded uncertainty of the value.  The method-specific value of the analyte lies within the interval x ± U95%(x) with 
about a 95 % confidence [2-3].  For fatty acids values containing NIST data, the uncertainty incorporates a component 
for possible inhomogeneity based on the standard deviation.  The measurands are the total mass fractions of fatty acids 
in peanut butter as listed in Table 4, on an as-received basis, as determined by the method indicated.  Metrological 
traceability is to the measurement processes and standards used by NIST and collaborating laboratories.

Certificate Revision History:  15 January 2020 (Change of expiration date; removal of certified values for palmitic acid, lignoceric acid, and 
total  saturated  fatty  acids  based  on  observed  instability;  removal  of  reference  value  for  acrylamide  based  on  observed  instability;  removal  of 
reference values for thiamine, riboflavin, niacinamide, niacin, total vitamin B3, pantothenic acid, pyridoxamine, pyridoxal, pyridoxine, and total 
vitamin B6 based on NIST's decision to no longer support these measurement capabilities in this matrix; certified values for fatty acids and total 
fats as the sum of fatty acids downgraded to reference values to properly reflect traceability and moved from Table 1 to Table 4; editorial changes); 
21 July 2015 (Addition of water-soluble vitamin values; removal of certified value for α-tocopherol; addition of reference value for α-tocopherol; 
editorial changes); 23 September 2014 (Extension of certificate period; editorial changes); 30 September 2009 (Extension of certificate period); 
12 January 2007  (editorial  changes);  29 September 2004  (Addition  of a reference  value  for  acrylamide); 14 March 2003  (Original  certificate 
date).
