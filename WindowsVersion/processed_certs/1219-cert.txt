Standard  Reference  Material  1219 

Cr16  —  Ni2  (AISI  431) 

(In  Cooperation  with  the  American  Society  for  Testing  &  Materials) 

This  Standard  Reference  Material  (SRM)  is  in  the  form  of  a  disk,  approximately  34  mm  (1  5/16  in)  in  diameter  and 
19  mm  (3/4  in)  thick,  and  is  intended  for  use  in  calibrating  optical  emission  and  x-ray  spectrometric  methods  of  analysis. 
Material  from  the  same  lot  is  also  available  in  the  form  of  chips  as 
SRM  343a  and  is  intended  for  use  in  checking  chemical 
methods  of  analysis.

2-The  estimated  uncertainty  listed  for  a  constituent  is  based  on  judgment  and  represents  an  evaluation 
of  the  combined  effects  of  method  imprecision,  possible  systematic  errors  among  methods,  and 
material]  variability. 
(No  attempt  was  made  to  derive  exact  statistical  measures  of  imprecision 
because  several  methods  were  involved  in  the  determination  of  most  constituents.) 

NOTE:  Material  for  this  SRM  was  processed  from  the  same  ingot  as  SRM  343a.  Homogeneity  examination  and 
-  selected  analyses  indicated  no  significant  differences  hetween  the  chip  and  disk  material. 

The  overall  coordination  of  the  technical  measurements  leading  to  certification  was  performed  under  the  direction  of 
J.1.  Shultz,  Research  Associate,  ASTM-NBS  Research  Associate  Program. 

The  technical  and  support  aspects  involved  in  the  preparation,  certification,  and  issuance  of  this  Standard  Reference 
Material  were  coordinated  through  the  Office  of  Standard  Reference  Materials  by  W.P.  Reed.
