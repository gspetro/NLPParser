Certificate of Analysis 
Standard Reference Material 2396 

 

 
Oxidative DNA Damage Mass Spectrometry Standards 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended for use in the identification and quantification of oxidatively 
damaged DNA base components for analysis by isotope-dilution techniques using either gas chromatography/mass 
spectrometry (GC/MS) [1], or liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) [2].  A unit of SRM 2396 is a set 
of  10 components,  which  includes  eight  oxidatively-modified,  stable  isotope-labeled  DNA  bases  (Components 1 
through 8), one stable isotope-labeled normal DNA nucleoside (Component 9), and one oxidatively-modified, stable 
isotope-labeled nucleoside (Component 10).  Each vial of SRM 2396 contains 0.2 mL of the designated component 
described in further detail below.   
 
The certified optical density of Component 10 (see Table 1) is used in the quantification of the DNA.  Components 
1–8 are included for identification of oxidatively damaged DNA base components by GC/MS.  Components 9 and 
10 are  for  identification  of  nucleosides  by  LC/MS.    In  addition,  Components  9 and  10 may  be  used  as  GC/MS 
internal  standards  when  modified  by  acidic  hydrolysis.    The  components  are  labeled  with  the  stable  isotopes  13C, 
15N,  and/or  2H.    The  names,  abbreviations,  structures,  and  information  concentrations  of  the  components  are 
provided in Table 2. 
 
Certified  Value:    The  certified  value  for  the  optical  density  of  Component  10,  8-OH-dGuo-15N5,  at  294 nm  is 
provided in Table 1 and is based on UV/visible absorption spectroscopy (UV/vis) measurements.  A NIST certified 
value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of 
bias have been investigated or taken into account [3].  The expanded uncertainty of the optical density defines an 
interval  within  which  the  unknown  value  of  optical  density  can  be  asserted  to  lie  with  a  level  of  confidence  of 
approximately 95 % [4]. 
 
Information  Values:    Table 2  lists  information  values  for  the  amount-of-substance  concentrations  of  the 
SRM 2396  components.    An  information  value  is  considered  a  value  that  will  be  of  use  to  the  SRM  user,  but 
insufficient  information  is  available  to  assess  the  uncertainty  associated  with  the  value.    Values  are  provided  in 
amount-of-substance units (mmol/L) [5]. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 2396 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until  01 March 2021,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  given  in  this 
certificate  (see  “Instructions  for  Storage  and  Use”).    The  certification  is  nullified  if  the  SRM  is  damaged, 
contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance  of  SRM  Certification:    NIST  will  monitor  this  SRM  over  the  period  of  its  certification.    If 
substantive  technical  changes  occur  that affect  the  certification before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST will 
notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
The overall direction and coordination of the technical measurements leading to the certification were performed by 
M. Satterfield and M. Dizdar of the NIST Biochemical Science Division. 
 
The analytical determination, technical  measurements, and analysis of data for the certification of this SRM were 
performed by M. Satterfield, D. Leber, P. Jaruga, and M. Dizdar of the NIST Biochemical Science Division. 
 
Statistical consultation for the uncertainty associated with the optical density of Component 10 was performed by 
S. Leigh and D. Leber of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division.

Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Measurement  Services 
Division. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE AND USE 
 
Storage:    Store  frozen  at  a  temperature  of  –20 C.    DO  NOT  use  a  self-defrosting  freezer  because  the  periodic 
cycling of temperatures may shorten the shelf life of this SRM. 
 
Use:    For  the  certified  and  informational  values  to  be  applicable,  once  thawed  each  SRM  component  must  be 
processed  without  delay.    Dilutions  of  these  materials  maybe  made  as  appropriate,  but  they  must  be  used 
immediately.  Certified and informational values do not apply to any material that has been thawed and subsequently 
refrozen. 
 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Preparation:    Components 1  through 10  were  purchased  from  Cambridge  Isotope  Laboratories  (Andover, MA).  
Each  component  was  received  in  solid  state  and  stored  at  –20 C  prior  to  preparation.    Using  an  analytical 
microbalance,  an  appropriate  amount  of  each  compound  was  weighed  separately  and  dissolved  in  HPLC-grade 
water in a volumetric flask.  After filling to volume and mixing, the individual components were aliquoted (0.2 mL) 
into sterile microcentrifuge vials and stored at –20 C.  Table 2 lists the names of Components 1 through 10, which 
are used as internal standards for the measurement of the corresponding unlabeled analogs in DNA by GC/MS [1]. 
 
Certified Value:  The certified value for Component 10 provided in Table 1 is based on the measurement of optical 
density (absorbance) at 294 nm for 10 µL of Component 10 diluted with 90 µL of HPLC-grade water, vortex-mixed, 
and transferred to a cuvette (Micro Cell 8 mm high, path length 10 mm, with silica windows which transmit from 
190 nm to 2500 nm), which was placed in the spectrophotometer.  Standard baseline subtraction using the signal at 
340 nm was used.  Absorbance measurements for the certified value of Component 10, 8-OH-dGuo-15N5, by UV/vis 
were  performed  on  two  spectrophotometers.    Traceability  to  the  International  System  of  Units (SI)  is  asserted 
through  the  use  of  SRM 2031  Metal-on-Fused  Silica  Filters  and  independent  verification  using  a  transfer 
spectrophotometer. 
 
The uncertainty is expressed as an expanded uncertainty, U = kuc, calculated according to the methods in the ISO 
Guide [4].  The quantity uc represents, at the level of one standard deviation, the potential combined effects of the 
uncertainty due to UV/vis equipment, variability due to Type B uncertainties including components attributable to 
dilution,  purity,  and  factors  influencing  the  absorbance  measurement  (temperature  of  the  solution,  mass  and 
volumetric).    The  value  of  the  coverage  factor,  k = 2.02,  is  determined  from  the  Student’s  t-distribution  with 
41 degrees of freedom and a confidence level of 95 %.

Information values for the amount-of-substance concentrations for the components (mmol/L) are shown in Table 2.  
The values listed are from averaging the available values determined using the techniques listed in Table 3, which 
include gravimetric, UV/vis, GC/MS, and LC/MS, as applicable.  The wavelength and absorption coefficient used 
for  the  UV/vis  measurements  performed  in  2010  are  also  listed  in  Table 3  for  each  of  the  components,  when 
applicable. 
 
NIST  Analyses:    NIST  conducted  the  UV/vis  measurements  for  Compounds 1  through 6,  9,  and 10  in 
2003 and 2010.    Results  were  compared  to  assess  the  stability  and  homogeneity  of  the  compounds.    The  UV/vis 
results from the 2010 measurements were used in the calculation of the information value for the components and 
are described below.  GC/MS and LC/MS techniques were used to assess the concentration of the components in 
2003 and are described below.

fused  silica  capillary  column 

 
UV/vis:    For  each  measurement,  an  aliquot  of  10 µL  of  the  solution  was  taken  and  diluted  with  90 µL  of 
HPLC-grade water.  The tube was vortex-mixed and the solution was transferred into the cuvette (Micro Cell 8 mm 
high, path length 10 mm, with silica windows, which transmit from 190 nm to 2500 nm), which was placed in the 
spectrophotometer.    After  being  allowed  to  equilibrate  for  30 seconds  the  absorbance  was  recorded  at  the 
wavelength  maxima  shown  in  Table 3.    Measurements  were  made  over  three  successive  days,  with  four 
measurements  made  each  day  for  a  total  of  12 measurements  of  each  component.    Baseline  subtraction  using  the 
signal at 340 nm for each component was used. 
 
GC/MS:    The  concentrations  of  Components 1  through 8  were  measured  by  GC/MS  with  electron-impact (EI) 
ionization.  Non-labeled versions of the components were used as internal standards and were custom synthesized by 
Program  Resources  Inc.  of  Dyncorp,  contracted  by  National  Cancer  Institute  (Frederick, MD) [6],  except  for 
Component 1  and  Component 6,  which  were  purchased  from  Sigma  Chemical  Company  (St.  Louis, MO).   
The  column  was  a 
(12.5 m × 0.2 mm i.d.)  coated  with  cross-linked 
5 % phenylmethylsilicone  (gum  phase,  film  thickness  0.33 m).    Aliquots  of  labeled  and  non-labeled  compounds 
were  mixed  and  lyophilized  in  glass  vials  to  dryness  for  18 h.    For  derivatization,  60 L  of  a  mixture  of 
nitrogen-bubbled bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetic acid (BSTFA), containing 1 % trimethylchlorosilane and pyridine 
(1:1, volume fractions) were added to the dried samples.  The vials were purged individually with ultra high-purity 
nitrogen,  tightly  sealed  under  nitrogen  with  Teflon-coated  septa,  and  then  vortex-mixed.    The  derivatization  was 
carried out at 120 °C for 30 minutes.  Aliquots of 2 μL of the derivatized samples were injected onto the GC column 
by means of an automatic sampler (split mode) with a split ratio of 10 to 1.  The selected-ion monitoring mode was 
used to monitor the characteristic ions of the trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatives of Components 1 through 8 in their EI 
mass  spectra  [1,7-10].    Table 4  shows  the  masses  of  the  characteristic  ions  of  the  TMS  derivatives  of  the 
Components 1 through 10 and their unlabeled analogs that can be used for identification and quantification. 
 
The mass ions of the TMS derivatives for Components 9 and 10 are included for use in quantification.  Component 9 
quantitatively  yields  Gua-15N5  upon  acidic  hydrolysis  and  is  used  as  an  internal  standard  for  the  measurement  of 
guanine in DNA by GC/MS, thus the amount of DNA [11].  Component 10 is used as an internal standard for the 
measurement of 8-OH-dGuo in DNA by LC/MS after enzymatic hydrolysis of DNA [12], and for the measurement 
of 8-OH-Gua in DNA by GC/MS after acidic hydrolysis of DNA [13]. 
 
LC/MS:    The  concentrations  of  the  Components 9  and 10  were  determined  by  LC/MS  with  the  atmospheric 
pressure  ionization-electrospray (API-ES)  process  in  the  positive  ionization  mode [12]  using  corresponding 
non-labeled  analogs  as  internal  standards.    Separations  were  performed  using  a  Zorbax  Eclipse  XDB C18 
reversed-phase  column  (15 cm × 0.21 cm  i.d.,  5 m  particle  size)  with  a  guard  column  packed  with  the  same 
stationary  phase  (1 cm × 0.21 cm i.d.).    The  mobile  phase  used  was  a  gradient  of  0.5 %  of  solvent B  per  minute, 
where  solvent A  was  a  mixture  of  water  and  acetonitrile  (98 %:2 %,  volume  fractions)  and  the  solvent  B  was 
acetonitrile.  The flow rate was 0.2 mL/min.  The column temperature was held at 30 °C.  Selected-ion monitoring 
mode was used to monitor the characteristic ions of the API-ES mass spectra of Components 9 and 10.  These mass 
+),  and  a  sodium  adduct 
spectra  consist  of  a  protonated  molecular  ion (MH+),  a  base  ion  with  two  H  atoms  (BH2
ion (MNa+) and are listed in Table 5 [12,14].
