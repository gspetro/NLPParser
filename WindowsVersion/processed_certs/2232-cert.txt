Standard Reference Material 2232  
Indium DSC Calibration Standard 
Temperature and Enthalpy of Fusion 

 

 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended for use in the temperature and enthalpy of fusion calibrations 
of differential thermal analyzers (DTA),
 differential scanning calorimeters (DSC), and similar instruments.  This 
SRM consists of a 1 g piece of indium metal sealed in an argon atmosphere in a mylar bag. 
 
Certified Temperature of Fusion:   The certified value of 156.598 5 ºC is  the temperature assigned to the melting 
point of pure indium [1].  The melting point is realized as the plateau temperature of the melting curve of the slowly 
melted, high purity indium. 
 

Temperature of Fusion:     156.598 5 ºC  ±  0.000 34 ºC 

 
Based on samples tested, the temperature range of melting  of bulk material is not e xpected to exceed 0.000 3 ºC. 
 material are expected to  differ by not more than 
Temperatures of melting curve plateaus for samples of this
0.000 1 ºC from each other and by not more than 0.000 34 ºC from the 
assigned temperature.  The basis for 
assigning an expanded uncertainty ( k = 2) of 0.000 34 ºC to the temperature of fusion of SRM 2232 is described in 
reference 2. 
 
Certified Enthalpy of Fusion:  
determined by performing duplicate measurements on seven SRM 2232 DSC samples.  The DSC onset temperature 
has an expanded uncertainty (k = 2) of 0.046 ºC. 
 

The certified enthalpy of fusion valu

e at the DSC onset temperature was 

Enthalpy of Fusion:     28.51 J·g–1  ±  0.19 J·g–1 

 
The uncertainty was calculated as two times the square root of the sum of three components of variance.  
Component one was the standard deviation of the mean from 14 measurements of the enthalpy of fusion of indium.  
Component two was the standard deviation of the mean of 14 measurements of the enthalpy of fusion of SRM 2220 
Tin that were used to calibrate the energy scale.  Component three was the variance of the enthalpy certification 
measurements for SRM 2220  Temperature and Enthalpy of Fusion – Tin  the calibration standard.  The variance for 
SRM 2220 was calculated as the square of one-half the stated uncertainty on the certificate.  The basis for assigning an 
expanded uncertainty (k = 2) of 0.19 J·g–1 to the enthalpy of fusion of SRM 2232 is described in reference 3. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  
uncertainties specified, provided the SRM is used in accordance with the “Notice and Warnings to Users” section of 
this certificate.  However, the certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged or contaminated. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:   NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If 
substantive technical changes occur that affect the certifi cation before the expiration of this certificate, NIST will 
notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
Temperature studies on fixed-point cells were performed by G.F. Strouse of the NIST Process Measurements 
Division.  DSC studies were performed by D.R. Kirklin of the NIST Physical and Chemical Properties Division.

NOTICE AND WARNING TO USERS 
 
Handling of SRM:   Any handling procedures of this high purity material are subject to introduce contamination.  
Every possible effort should be made to maintain the purity of this SRM. 
 
SOURCE AND ANALYSIS1 
 
Source of Material:   The indium metal (Lot S2739) for this SRM was obtained from Arconium (Providence, RI). 
The indium is of high purity, with the total of all elements that affect the melting point temperature being less than
0.1 mg/kg. 
 
Temperature of Fusion Measurements:   The thermal tests for the certification of this SRM were performed on a 
ribed in reference 4.  The cell contains approximately 
fixed-point cell prepared in a manner similar to that desc
1190 g of indium obtained from the randomly-selected 1 g pieces of indium of lot S2739. 
 
The freezing points were prepared using the recomme
completely melted, the furnace was set at approximately
supercooling and recalescence had been observed with a 25.5  Ω standard platinum resi stance thermometer (SPRT) 
in the cell, the thermometer was removed and two fused s ilica glass rods, each initially at room temperature, were 
inserted successively into the well for  about three minutes each to induce freezi ng of a thin mantle of solid metal 
around the well.  The thermometer was then reinserted into the cell and the recording of readings was begun.  After 
equilibrium was established, the temperature of the pl ateau on the freezing curve was found to vary no more than 
0.000 03 ºC during the first 50 % of the duration of th
curve obtained under such 
conditions is shown in Figure 1 (the re gion of supercooling and recalescence is not shown, as the curve begins after 
the reinsertion of the thermometer); a sample of the data is plotted at greater resolution in Figure 2. 
 
After the metal was slowly and comple tely frozen in the above manner, the  furnace was set at approximately 1 ºC 
above the freezing point temperature to  slowly melt over a time period of a pproximately 10 hours.  Thermometer 
readings were recorded continuously until the melting wa s complete.  A typical melti ng curve obtained under such 
conditions is shown in Figure 3. 
 
Following the freezing and melting curve measurements, the pl ateau temperature of a freezing curve of the test cell 
was compared directly with that of  the standard indium freezing  point cell of the Platinum Resistance Thermometer 
Calibration Laboratory, using a 25.5  Ω SPRT.  The method of direct comparison is described in detail in 
reference 5. 
 
During the freezing and melting curve measurements, an
maintained in the cells. 
 
The electronic measurement equipment included an ASL F18 resistance ratio bridge, operating at a frequency of 
30 Hz, and temperature-controlled Tinsley 5685A 100 Ω reference resistor.  This reference resistor was maintained 
at a temperature of 25.00 ºC  ± 0.010 ºC.  Freezing curve and melting curve measurements were made with an 
excitation current of 1 mA.  Direct comparison measurements were made using a 25.5 
currents of l mA and
controlled data acquisition system was used to acquire the ASL F18 bridge readings through the use of an IEEE-488 
bus. 
 
Enthalpy of Fusion Measurements:  
SRM 2232 and seven tin samples, 9 mg to 14 mg each, cut from a 6.25 cm 2 sheet of SRM 2220 were used in the 
DSC measurements, which were performed on a Perkin 
temperatures of fusion for tin and indium we re used to calibrate the temperature axis.   The enthalpy of fusion of tin 
was used to calibrate the measured 
energy (measured area).  After lineari
temperatures and enthalpies of fusion were measured for the set of seven SRM 2220 tin samples used in the 
calibration of the instrument.  Duplicate measurements were made on seven SRM 2232 indium samples to 
determine the certified values and the observed variability due to the instrument and sample configuration.
typical DSC melting curve of the indium is shown in Figure 4.
