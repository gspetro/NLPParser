2. HAZARDS IDENTIFICATION

Radiological Hazard  

Warning:  THIS MATERIAL SHOULD ONLY BE USED BY PERSONS QUALIFIED TO HANDLE RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL!  

	This product contains licensed radioactive material and is therefore subject to the requirements of 10 CFR Part 20 (e.g., public and occupational exposure limits, waste disposal).  At a minimum, the basic radiation safety principles of time, distance, and shielding, and appropriate radiation contamination control should be practiced to avoid/minimize any external and/or internal exposure.  Consult with your Radiation Safety office for your facility’s radiation safety requirements/precautions specific to the radionuclide(s) (including its activity and chemical/physical form) in this Radioactive SRM.

	SRM 4407H is a radioactive material, Iodine-125, with a total activity of approximately 750 MBq.  Iodine-125 decays by electron capture, and during the decay process, Xrays and gamma rays with energies from 4 keV to 36 keV are emitted.  THIS SRM SHOULD ONLY BE USED BY PERSONS QUALIFIED TO HANDLE RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL!

4. FIRST AID MEASURES

Description of First Aid Measures: 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration or oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention.

Skin Contact:  Rinse affected area with copious amounts of water followed by washing with soap and water for at least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing.  Seek medical attention, if needed.

Eye Contact:  Immediately flush eyes, including under the eyelids with copious amounts of water for at least 30 minutes.  Seek immediate medical attention.

Ingestion:  Contact a poison control center immediately for instructions.  Wash out mouth with water, but do not induce vomiting.  Seek medical aid at once, and bring the container or label.

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  Not applicable.

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention.  

5. FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES
