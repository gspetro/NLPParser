1.  SUBSTANCE AND SOURCE IDENTIFICATION  

Product Identifier 

SRM Number:  1085c 
SRM Name:    Wear Metals in Lubricating Oil 
Other Means of Identification:  Not applicable. 

Recommended Use of This Material and Restrictions of Use 

This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended primarily for use in the evaluation of methods and in the 
calibration of apparatus used in the analysis of engine lubricating oils and other materials of similar matrix for 
metal content.  A unit of SRM 1085c consists of 10 amber borosilicate ampoules, each containing approximately 
1.2 g of base oil:  five ampoules of a blend of constituent elements in a base oil; and five ampoules of the matching 
base oil intended for use as an analytical blank and for matrix matching.

4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Description of First Aid Measures  

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  Give artificial respiration if not breathing.  
Get immediate medical attention. 
Skin Contact:  Remove contaminated clothing, jewelry, and shoes immediately.  Wipe all material off skin before 
washing.  Wash with soap or mild detergent and large amounts of water until no evidence of chemical remains 
(at least 15 to 20 minutes).  Get medical attention, if needed. 
Eye Contact:  Flush eyes with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes.  Then get immediate medical attention. 
Ingestion:  DO NOT induce vomiting.  If vomiting occurs, keep head lower than hips to help prevent aspiration.  
Get medical attention. 

Most  Important  Symptoms/Effects,  Acute  and  Delayed:    Exposure  may  irritate  the  eyes,  skin,  and  respiratory 
system. 

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above 
symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire  and  Explosion  Hazards:    Negligible  fire  hazard.    See  Section 9,  “Physical  and  Chemical  Properties”  for 
flammability properties. 
Extinguishing Media 

Suitable:  Dry chemical, carbon dioxide, foam or water spray is recommended. 
Unsuitable:  None listed. 

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  Not applicable. 
Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Move container from fire area if it can be done 
without personal risk.  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion by-products.  Wear full protective clothing and 
NIOSH-approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe) 
 

Reactivity = 0 

Health = 0 

Fire = 1 

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Use suitable protective equipment; 
see Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”. 
Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Do not touch spilled material.  Absorb with sand or other 
non-combustible material and collect in appropriate container for proper disposal.  

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Safe Handling Precautions:  Use suitable personal protection equipment (PPE).  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls 
and Personal Protection”. 
Storage and Incompatible Materials:  Store and handle in accordance with all current regulations and standards.  
Keep separated from incompatible substances. 

8.  EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

Exposure Limits:  There are no occupational exposure limits established for white mineral oil.  The exposure limits 
for oil mists (if generated) are provided below as a reference. 

ACGIH (TLV): 
 

 

5 mg/m3  (TWA) 
10 mg/m3  (STEL) 

Engineering Controls:   Provide  local  exhaust  or  process  enclosure  ventilation  system.  Ensure  compliance  with 
applicable exposure limits.

Personal Protection Measures:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate PPE to 
minimize exposure to this material. 

Respiratory  Protection:    If workplace conditions warrant a  respirator, a  respiratory protection program that 
meets OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.   Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators. 

Eye Protection:  Splash resistant safety goggles and emergency eyewash are recommended. 

Skin and Body Protection:  Chemical resistant clothing and gloves are recommended.
