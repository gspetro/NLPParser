Description:    This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  a  gravimetrically  prepared  single-compound  solution 
(benzene)  in  methanol  intended  primarily  for  the  calibration  of  instrumentation  and  validation  of  methods  for 
volatile  organic  compound (VOC)  determinations.    A  unit  of  SRM 3000  consists  of  two  5 mL  sealed  borosilicate 
glass  ampoules  of  a  gravimetrically  prepared  solution  of  benzene  in  methanol.    Approximately  2.5 mL  of  this 
mixture is supplied in each 5 mL glass ampoule. 

Other Designations:  Methanol (Wood alcohol; wood spirit; methyl hydroxide; methyl alcohol);   Benzene  (benzol; 
cyclohexatriene; benzole; phene; pyrobenzol; pyrobenzole; coal tar naphtha;  phenyl hydride; benzolene) 

Substance: Benzene/Methanol Solution 

2.  HAZARDS IDENTIFICATION  

NFPA Ratings (Scale 0-4):  Health = 2 

Fire = 3 

Reactivity = 0 

Major Health Hazards:  Skin and eye irritation, central nervous system depression, aspiration hazard, and nerve 
damage. 

Physical Hazards:  Flammable liquid and vapor.  Vapor may cause flash fire. 

Potential Health Effects (Acute and Chronic) 

Inhalation:    Methanol  can  cause  irritation  of  the  mucous  membranes,  coughing,  ringing  in  the  ears, 
constipation,  recurrent  headaches,  drowsiness,  dizziness,  tingling  sensation,  tremors,  loss  of  coordination, 
enlargement of the liver, blood disorders, oppression in the chest, tracheitis, bronchitis, tinnitus, unsteady gait, 
twitching,  colic,  nystagmus,  blepharospasm,  and  nerve  damage.    Occupational  exposure  symptoms  include 
paresthesias, numbness and shooting pains in the hands and forearms.  Metabolic acidosis and effects on the 
eyes and central nervous system may occur. 

Benzene can cause irritation, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, difficulty breathing, irregular heartbeat, headache, 
drowsiness, dizziness, disorientation, sleep disturbances, mood swings, tremors, loss of coordination, blurred 
vision, lung congestion, internal bleeding, blood disorders, paralysis, and coma. 

Skin  Contact:    Methanol  can  cause  irritation;  skin  absorption  may  occur  and  cause  metabolic  acidosis  and 
effects on the eyes and central nervous system.  Repeated or prolonged contact may cause defatting of the skin 
resulting  in  erythema,  scaling,  and  eczematoid  dermatitis.    Chronic  absorption  may  result  in  headache, 
drowsiness, dizziness, loss of coordination, and blood disorders. 

Benzene is potentially fatal on contact with the skin. 

Eye  Contact:    Methanol  vapors  may  cause  irritation  and  eye  damage.    Concentrated  solutions  have  been 
reported  to  cause  violent  inflammation  of  the  conjunctiva  and  epithelial  defects on  the  cornea.    Repeated  or 
prolonged contact may cause conjunctivitis. 

Benzene may cause irritation; long term exposure may result in conjunctivitis. 

Ingestion:    Ingestion  of  methanol  may  result  in  mild  and  transient  inebriation  and  subsequent  drowsiness.  
Liver,  kidney,  heart,  stomach,  intestine  and  pancreatic  damage  may  also  occur.    Death  may  occur  due  to 
respiratory failure.  As little as 15 mL has caused blindness; the usual fatal dose is 60–240 mL. 

Benzene, if ingested, can cause irritation, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, difficulty breathing, irregular heartbeat, 
headache,  drowsiness,  convulsions,  and  coma.    Potential  aspiration  hazard  if  ingested.    Chronic  effects  may 
result in kidney damage and cancer.
