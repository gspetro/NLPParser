4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Description of First Aid Measures:  

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration 
or oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Skin Contact:  Wash skin with soap and water for at least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing and 
shoes.  Get immediate medical attention.  Thoroughly clean and dry contaminated clothing before reuse.  Destroy 
contaminated shoes. 

Eye Contact:  Immediately flush eyes, including under the eyelids with copious amounts of water for at least 
15 minutes.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Ingestion:  Contact a poison control center immediately for instructions.  Do not induce vomiting.  Give water to 
rinse out mouth.  Never give liquids to a person with reduced awareness or becoming unconscious.  If vomiting 
occurs, keep head lower than hips to prevent aspiration.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration by qualified 
personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  Inhalation, ingestion or skin contact may result in severe 
injury or death.  

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above 
symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire  and  Explosion  Hazards:    Negligible  fire  hazard.    See  Section  9,  “Physical  and  Chemical  Properties”  for 
flammability properties.

Unsuitable:  None listed. 

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  Miscellaneous decomposition products. 

Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion 
byproducts.  Wear full protective clothing and NIOSH approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe)

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Personal  Precautions,  Protective  Equipment  and  Emergency  Procedures:    Immediately  contact  emergency 
personnel.  Keep unnecessary personnel away.  Use suitable protective equipment; see Section 8, “Exposure Controls 
and Personal Protection”. 

Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Do not touch spilled material.  Absorb with sand or other 
non-combustible material.  Collect spilled material in appropriate container for disposal.  Keep unnecessary people 
away, isolate hazard area and deny entry.

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Safe Handling Precautions:  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”. 

Storage:    Store  and  handle  in  accordance  with  all  current  regulations  and  standards.    Keep  separated  from 
incompatible substances (see Section 10, “Stability and Reactivity”). 

8.  EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

 
Exposure Limits:  (as F, related to Fluorides)

Engineering Controls:   Provide  local  exhaust  or  process  enclosure  ventilation  system.  Ensure  compliance  with 
applicable exposure limits. 

Personal Protection:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal Protective 
Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material. 

Respiratory  Protection:    If workplace conditions warrant a  respirator, a  respiratory protection program that 
meets OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.   Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators. 

Eye/Face Protection:  Wear splash resistant safety goggles with a face shield.  An eyewash station should be 
readily available near areas of use. 

Skin and Body Protection:  Personal protective equipment for the body should be selected based on the task 
being performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a specialist before handling this product.  
Chemical-resistant gloves should be worn at all times when handling chemicals.

Ingestion 

Symptoms Related to the Physical, Chemical and Toxicological Characteristics:  Inhalation, ingestion or skin 
contact may result in severe injury or death. 

Potential Health Effects (Acute, Chronic and Delayed): 

Inhalation:    Acute  inhalation  of  dust  may  cause  irritation  with  coughing  and  shortness  of  breath,  nausea, 
laryngeal and pulmonary edema, and aggravate asthma.  Systemic poisoning as detailed in acute ingestion may 
occur.  Chronic exposure may cause nosebleeds hoarseness, sore throat, sinus trouble, and asthma.  Hydrogen 
fluoride, a corrosive substance may be formed. 

Skin Contact:  Skin contact may result in irritation. 

Eye Contact:  Exposure may result in strong irritation. 

Ingestion:  In the presence of moisture, corrosive hydrogen fluoride may be formed, especially in the stomach.  
Symptoms may include a burning sensation in the mouth and abdomen, sore tongue, a salty or soapy taste, nausea, 
vomiting,  diarrhea,  and  weight  loss.    Intense  epigastric  pain,  deep  ulceration  of  the  esophagus  and  mucous 
membranes,  hematemesis  and  hematuria  may  also  be  present.    Other  symptoms  may  include  spasms  of  the
