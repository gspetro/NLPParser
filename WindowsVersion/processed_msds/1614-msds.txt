4.  First Aid Measures

Description of First Aid Measures 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to wellventilated (uncontaminated) area.  Give artificial respiration if not breathing.  Get immediate medical attention.

Skin Contact:  Wash skin with soap and water for at least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing and shoes.  Thoroughly clean and dry before reuse. Get medical attention, if needed.

Eye Contact:  Flush eyes with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes.  Then get immediate medical attention.

Ingestion:  Aspiration hazard.  Do not induce vomiting.  If vomiting occurs, keep head lower than hips to help prevent aspiration.  Get immediate medical attention.  Give artificial respiration if not breathing.

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  Respiratory tract irritation, aspiration hazard, central nervous system depression.

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention.

5.  Fire Fighting Measures

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Severe fire hazard.  The vapor is heavier than air.  Vapor/air mixtures are explosive above the flash point.  Vapors or gases may ignite at distant ignition sources and flash back.  See Section 9, “Physical and Chemical Properties” for flammability properties.

Extinguishing Media

	Suitable:  Regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide, water, or alcoholresistant foam.

	Unsuitable:  None listed.

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  Not applicable.

Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for FireFighters:  Move container from fire area if it can be done without personal risk.  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion byproducts.  Wear full protective clothing and NIOSHapproved selfcontained breathing apparatus (SCBA).

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe)

				Health = 2	Fire = 3	Reactivity = 0

6.  Accidental Release Measures

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Use suitable protective equipment; see Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.  Keep out of waters supplies and sewers.

Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Avoid heat, flames, sparks and other sources of ignition.  Stop leak if possible without personal risk, with water spray to reduce vapors.  Absorb spilled material with sand or noncombustible material and collect in appropriate container for disposal. 

7.  Handling and Storage

Safe Handling Precautions:  Handle glass ampoules with care.  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.

Storage and Incompatible Materials:  Store in a wellventilated area.  Keep separated from incompatible substances (see Section 10, “Stability and Reactivity”).

8. Exposure Controls and Personal Protection

Exposure Limits:  No occupational limits established.

Engineering Controls:  Provide local exhaust or process enclosure ventilation system.  Ensure compliance with applicable exposure limits.

Personal Protection Measures:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material.

Respiratory Protection:  If workplace conditions warrant a respirator, a respiratory protection program that meets OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.  Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators.

Eye Protection:  Splash resistant safety goggles and emergency eyewash are recommended.

Skin and Body Protection:  Chemical resistant clothing and gloves are recommended.

Ingestion

Symptoms Related to the Physical, Chemical and Toxicological Characteristics:  Skin irritation, eye irritation, central nervous system depression, and nerve damage.

Potential Health Effects (Acute, Chronic, and Delayed)

Inhalation:  Acute exposure may cause irritation of the mucous membranes, rapid breathing, dizziness, fatigue, and headache.  Extreme exposure may cause unconsciousness and respiratory arrest.  Repeated and prolonged exposure may cause polyneuropathy.
