4. FIRST AID MEASURES 

Description of First Aid Measures  

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  Give artificial respiration if not breathing. 
Get immediate medical attention.  

Skin Contact:  Rinse affected skin with water for at least 15 minutes, then wash thoroughly with soap or mild 
detergent and water.  Seek medical attention if need; bring the container. 

Eye Contact:  Flush eyes with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes. Then get immediate medical attention. 

Ingestion:  If a large amount is swallowed, get medical attention. 

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed: No data available. 

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  None listed. 

5. FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Slight fire hazard.  See Section 9, “Physical and Chemical Properties” for flammability 
properties. 

Extinguishing Media 
 
 
Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  Not applicable. 

Suitable:  Regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide, water, or regular foam. 
Unsuitable:  None listed. 

Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Move container from fire area if it can be done 
without personal risk.  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion by-products.  Wear full protective clothing and 
NIOSH-approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe) 
 

Reactivity = 0 

Health = 1 

Fire = 1 

6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Use suitable protective equipment; see 
Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.  Keep out of waters supplies and sewers. 

Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Absorb spilled material with sand or non-combustible 
material and collect in appropriate container for disposal.  

7. HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Safe Handling Precautions:  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”. 

Storage  and  Incompatible  Materials:    SRM 1595  should  be  stored  in  a  tightly
temperature (
information.  Keep separated from incompatible substances (oxidizing materials). 

closed  bottle  at  or  below  room 
20 °C to 23 °C is recommended).  See the NIST Certificate of Analysis for additional storage and use

8. EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

Exposure Limits:  OSHA Particulates Not Otherwise Regulated (PNOR) applies to this material. 

 
 

OSHA (PEL):  15 mg/m3 Total dust 

5 mg/m3 Respirable fraction 

Engineering  Controls:    Provide  local  exhaust  or  process  enclosure  ventilation  system.    Ensure  compliance  with 
applicable exposure limits. 
Personal Protection Measures:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal 
Protective Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material. 

Respiratory  Protection:    If  workplace  conditions  warrant  a  respirator,  a  respiratory  protection  program  that 
meets OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.  Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators. 

Eye Protection:  Splash resistant safety goggles and emergency eyewash are recommended. 

Skin and Body Protection:  Chemical resistant clothing and gloves are recommended.
