4.  First Aid Measures

Description of First Aid Measures 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to wellventilated (uncontaminated) area.  If breathing is difficult, qualified personnel may administer oxygen.  If not breathing, qualified personnel should give artificial respiration.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Skin Contact:  Rinse affected skin with water for at least 15 minutes, then wash thoroughly with soap or mild detergent and water.  If skin irritation persists, seek medical aid and bring the container or label.

Eye Contact:  Immediately flush eyes, including under the eyelids, with copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes.  Seek immediate medical attention.

Ingestion:  Aspiration hazard.  Do not induce vomiting.  Contact local poison control immediately; if vomiting occurs, keep head lower than hips to prevent aspiration.  If unconscious, turn head to side; get medical attention immediately.

Ingestion

Symptoms Related to the Physical, Chemical and Toxicological Characteristics:  Skin irritation, eye irritation, central nervous system depression.

Potential Health Effects (Acute, Chronic, and Delayed)

Inhalation:  Acute exposure may result in irritation, headache, drowsiness, dizziness, vomiting, sleep disturbances, emotional disturbances, tremors, loss of coordination, visual disturbances, chest pain, difficulty breathing, irregular heartbeat, lung congestion, internal bleeding, blood disorders, kidney damage, liver damage, paralysis, brain damage, convulsions, unconsciousness, and coma.  Chronic exposure may result in the same effects as acute exposure but with changes in body temperature, and changes in blood pressure.
