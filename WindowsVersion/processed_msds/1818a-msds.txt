4. FIRST AID MEASURES 

Description of First Aid Measures:  

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration 
or oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Skin Contact:  Wash exposed skin with soap and water for at least 15 minutes.  Seek medical attention if needed. 

Eye Contact:  Immediately flush eyes, including under the eyelids with copious amounts of water for at least 
15 minutes.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Ingestion:  Aspiration hazard.  Do not induce vomiting.  If vomiting occurs, keep head lower than hips to prevent 
aspiration.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  Skin and/or eye irritation. 

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  Not applicable. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Slight fire hazard.  See Section 9, “Physical and Chemical Properties” for flammability 
properties. 

Extinguishing Media: 
 
 

Suitable:  Regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide, and regular foam. 
Unsuitable:  Water may cause splattering.   

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  None listed. 

Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion 
by-products.  Wear full protective clothing and NIOSH approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe) 

 

Health = 1 

Fire = 1 

Reactivity = 0 

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Use suitable protective equipment; 
see Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”. 

Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Absorb spilled material with sand or non-combustible 
material and collect in appropriate container for disposal. 

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Safe Handling Precautions:  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”. 

Storage:    Store  and  handle  in  accordance  with  all  current  regulations  and  standards.    The  storage  floor  must  be 
impermeable and form a collecting basin so that, in the event of an accident spillage, the liquid cannot spread beyond 
the storage area. 

8.  EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

Exposure Limits:  There are no occupational exposure limits established for lubricating base oil.  The exposure limits 
for mineral oil (CAS No. 8012-95-1) are provided below as a reference. 

OSHA (PEL): 
NIOSH (REL): 
 
 
ACGIH (TLV): 

 

5 mg/m3 (TWA) 
5 mg/m3 (TWA) 
10 mg/m3 (STEL) 
2.5 g/m3 (IDLH) 
5 mg/m3  (TWA, excluding metal working fluids, highly and severely refined, inhalable 
fractions) 

Engineering Controls:   Provide  local  exhaust  or  process  enclosure  ventilation  system.  Ensure  compliance  with 
applicable exposure limits. 

Personal Protection Measures:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal 
Protective Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material.

Respiratory Protection:    If workplace conditions warrant a respirator, a respiratory protection program that 
meets  OSHA  29CFR  1910.134  must  be  followed.    Refer  to  NIOSH  42  CFR  84  for  applicable  certified 
respirators. 

Eye/Face Protection:  Wear splash resistant safety goggles with a face shield. An eye wash station should be 
readily available near areas of use. 

Skin and Body Protection:  Personal protective equipment for the body should be selected based on the task 
being performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a specialist before handling this product. 
Chemical-resistant gloves should be worn at all times when handling chemicals.

Route of Exposure: 

X 

Inhalation 

X 

Skin 

X 

Ingestion 

Symptoms Related to the Physical, Chemical and Toxicological Characteristics: Skin and/or eye irritation. 

Potential Health Effects (Acute, Chronic and Delayed): 

Inhalation:  Acute exposure to mists or sprays of insoluble mineral oils are usually not harmful to the respiratory 
tract; however, discomfort may occur at concentrations above 5 mg/m3.  Prolonged or repeated exposure may 
cause fibrotic nodules, lipid pneumonia, and lipid granuloma. 

Skin Contact:  Acute exposure may cause oil folliculitis due to the mechanical plugging of the hair follicles.  
Some people may develop sensitivity to petroleum products or additives used in petroleum products.  Chronic 
skin exposure may cause defatting and drying of the skin resulting in irritation and dermatitis. 

Eye Contact:  Acute exposure to liquid or mist may cause irritation.  Repeated exposure may cause conjunctivitis. 

Ingestion:  Acute exposure by ingestion may cause gastrointestinal disturbances such as diarrhea.
