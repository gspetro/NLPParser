2657a 
Oxygen in Nitrogen (Nominal Amount-of-Substance Fraction 2 % mol/mol) 

Recommended Use of This Material and Restrictions of Use 
This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  a  primary  gas  mixture  for  which  the  amount-of-substance  fraction, 
expressed as concentration, may be related to secondary working standards.  This SRM is intended for the calibration 
of  instruments  used  for  oxygen  determinations  and  for  other  applications.    This  SRM  mixture  is  supplied  in  a 
DOT 3AL specification aluminum (6061 alloy)  cylinder with a water volume of 6 L.  Mixtures are shipped with a 
nominal pressure exceeding 12.4 MPa (1800 psig), which provides the user with 0.73 m3 (25.8 ft3) of useable mixture.  
The cylinder is the property of the purchaser and is equipped with a CGA-580 brass valve, which is the recommended 
outlet for this oxygen mixture.

4. FIRST AID MEASURES 

Description of First Aid Measures 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration 
or oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention. 
Skin Contact:  Not applicable. 
Eye Contact:  Immediately flush eyes, including under the eyelids with copious amounts of water for at least 
15 minutes.  Seek immediate medical attention. 
Ingestion:  Ingestion of a gas is unlikely. 

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  Potentially fatal if inhaled. 

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above 
symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention. 

5. FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire  and Explosion  Hazards:    Negligible  fire hazard  applicable  to  the  identified  NIST  cylinder.    Cylinders may 
rupture or explode if exposed to heat.  See Section 9, “Physical and Chemical Properties” for flammability properties. 

Extinguishing Media: 
 
 

Suitable:  Use extinguishing media appropriate to the surrounding fire. 
Unsuitable:  None listed. 

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  Oxides of carbon. 

Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Move cylinder from fire area if it can be done 
without  personal risk.   Avoid  inhalation  of  material  or  combustion  byproducts.   Wear  full  protective  clothing  and 
NIOSH approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe) 
 

Reactivity = 0 

Health = 1 

Fire = 0 

6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Personal  Precautions,  Protective  Equipment  and  Emergency  Procedures:    Immediately  contact  emergency 
personnel.  Keep unnecessary personnel away.  Use suitable protective equipment; see Section 8, “Exposure Controls 
and Personal Protection”.  Shut off gas supply if this can be done safely.  Isolate area until gas has dispersed. 

Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Stop leak if possible without personal risk.  Isolate hazard 
area and deny entry.  Stay upwind and keep out of low areas. 

7. HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Safe Handling Precautions:  Close valve after each use and when empty.  Keep valve protection cap on cylinder 
when not in use. 

Storage:    Store  and  handle  in  accordance  with  all  current  regulations  and  standards.    Secure  cylinder  to  prevent 
physical damage.  Keep separated from incompatible substances (see Section 10, “Stability and Reactivity”).  Store 
in well-ventilated area.  Subject to storage regulations, OSHA 29 CFR 1910.101.

no occupational exposure limits established 

Engineering  Controls:    Provide  local  exhaust  or  process  enclosure  ventilation  system.    Ensure  compliance  with 
applicable exposure limits. 

Personal Protection:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal Protective 
Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material. 

Respiratory  Protection:    If  workplace  conditions  warrant  a  respirator,  a  respiratory  protection  program  that 
meets OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.  Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators. 

Eye/Face Protection:  Wear splash resistant safety goggles with a face shield.  An eyewash station should be 
readily available near areas of use. 

Skin and Body Protection:  Personal protective equipment for the body should be selected based on the task 
being  performed  and  the  risks  involved  and  should  be  approved  by  a  specialist  before  handling  this  product.  
Chemical-resistant gloves should be worn at all times when handling chemicals.

Ingestion 

Symptoms Related to the Physical, Chemical and Toxicological Characteristics:  Nausea, headache, weakness, 
drowsiness. 

Potential Health Effects (Acute, Chronic and Delayed): 

Inhalation:    Nitrogen  compressed  gas  is  a  simple  asphyxiant.    Release  in  an  enclosed  space  may  result  in 
asphyxiation.  The symptoms of asphyxia depend on the rapidity with which the oxygen deficiency develops and 
how long it continues.  In sudden acute asphyxia, unconsciousness may be immediate.  With slow development, 
there may be rapid respiration and pulse, air hunger, dizziness, reduced awareness, tightness in the head, tingling 
sensations, incoordination, faulty judgment, emotional instability, and rapid fatigue.  As the asphyxia progresses, 
nausea, vomiting, collapse, unconsciousness, convulsions, deep coma, and death are possible.  

Skin Contact:  No information on significant adverse effects. 

Eye Contact:  No information on significant adverse effects. 

Ingestion:  Ingestion of a gas is unlikely under normal conditions of use.
