	Product Identifier

		RM Number:  8493

		RM Name:	Monterey Pine Whole Biomass Feedstock

		Other Means of Identification:  Not applicable.

	Recommended Use of This Material and Restrictions of Use

This Reference Material (RM) is intended primarily for use in evaluating analytical methods for the determination of summative composition of lignocellulosic material.  The RM can also be used for quality assurance when assigning values to in-house control materials.  The whole softwood biomass material is derived from Monterey pine (Pinus radiata).  A unit of the RM consists of five single-use Mylar bags of whole biomass, each containing approximately 10 g of material.

4. FIRST AID MEASURES

Description of First Aid Measures: 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration or oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention.

Skin Contact:  Wash skin with soap and water.

Eye Contact:  Flush eyes with water for at least 15 minutes.  If necessary, seek medical attention.

Ingestion:  If adverse effects occur after ingestion, seek medical treatment.

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  Generated dust may cause irritation; chronic inhalation of wood dust may cause cancer. 

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above symptoms are present, seek medical attention if needed.

5. FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Avoid generating dust; sufficient concentrations of fine dust dispersed in air, and in the presence of an ignition source is a potential hazard.  See Section 9, “Physical and Chemical Properties” for flammability properties.

Extinguishing Media:

		Suitable:  Regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide, water, regular foam.

		Unsuitable:  None listed.

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  None listed.

Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion byproducts.  Wear full protective clothing and NIOSH approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA).

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe)	

				Health = 1	Fire = 1	Reactivity = 0

6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Any accumulated material on surfaces should be removed and disposed of properly.  Use suitable protective equipment; see Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.

Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Collect spilled material in appropriate container for disposal.  Keep out of water supplies and sewers.  Keep unnecessary people away, isolate hazard area and deny entry.

7. HANDLING AND STORAGE

Safe Handling Precautions:  Minimize dust generation and accumulation on surfaces.  Routine housekeeping should be instituted to ensure that dusts do not accumulate on surfaces.  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.  Avoid contact with incompatible materials (see Section 10, “Stability and Reactivity”).

Storage:  Store and handle in accordance with all current regulations and standards.  

8. EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION

Exposure Limits:  No occupational exposure limits established for wood dust.  OSHA regulates wood dust exposure under the requirements for Particulates Not Otherwise Regulated.

		OSHA (PEL):	15 mg/m3 TWA (total particulates)

			5 mg/m3 TWA (respirable particulates)

		NIOSH (REL):	1 mg/m3 TWA (wood dust)

			

		ACGIH (TLV):	1 mg/m3 TWA (wood dust all species except western red cedar)

			0.5 mg/m3 TWA (Western red cedar wood dust)

		

Engineering Controls:  Provide local exhaust or process enclosure ventilation system.  Ensure compliance with applicable exposure limits.

Personal Protection:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material.

Respiratory Protection:  If workplace conditions warrant a respirator, a respiratory protection program that meets OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.  Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators.

Eye/Face Protection:  Wear splash resistant safety goggles with a face shield.  An eye wash station should be readily available near areas of use.

Skin and Body Protection:  Personal protective equipment for the body should be selected based on the task being performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a specialist before handling this product.  Chemical-resistant gloves should be worn at all times when handling chemicals.
