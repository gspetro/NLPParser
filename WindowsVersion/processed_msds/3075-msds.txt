Description:  This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is a solution of Aroclor 1060 (Chemical Abstracts Registry 
Number  12674-11-2)  in  transformer  oil.    This  SRM  is  intended  primarily  for  calibrating  chromatographic 
instrumentation  and  methods  of  analysis  used  for  the  determination  of  Aroclor  1060  and  polychlorinated 
biphenyls (PCBs)  in  transformer  oil.    A  unit  of  SRM 3075  consists  of  five  2 mL  ampoules,  each  containing 
approximately 1.2 mL of transformer oil. 

Substance:  Transformer Oil, Aroclor 1060 

Other Designations: 
Transformer  Oil  (hydrotreated  light  naphthenic  distillates  [petroleum];  distillates,  petroleum,  hydrotreated  light 
naphthenic;  hydraulic  petroleum  oil;  mineral  oil,  petroleum  distillates,  hydrotreated  light  naphthenic;  petroleum 
electrical insulating oil). 

2.  HAZARDS IDENTIFICATION 

NFPA Ratings (Scale 0–4):  Health = 2 

Fire = 1 

Reactivity = 0 

NOTE:  The health and safety information included in this MSDS is for transformer oil, the main component of this 
SRM.    The  concentration  of  Aroclor 1060  in  this  NIST  SRM  is  below  the  reportable  limits  for  hazardous 
components (1 %) and/or carcinogens (0.1 %), as required by OSHA, 29 CFR 1910.1200 (g)(2)(i)(C)(1), for MSDS 
information. 

Major Health Hazards: Irritation (eye, respiratory tract, and skin), aspiration hazard, and cancer. 

Physical Hazards:  Not Applicable. 

Potential Health Effects (Acute and Chronic): 

Inhalation:  There is no specific information for acute or chronic inhalation effects for transformer oil.   

Skin  Contact:    Short-term  and  long-term  contact  with  transformer  oil  material  may  cause  skin  irritation  and 
dermatitis.(a)   

Eye Contact:  Short-term and long-term exposure to transformer oil may cause irritation. 

Ingestion:  Acute ingestion of transformer oil may cause abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.  Small amounts 
of  oil  aspirated  during  ingestion  or  vomiting  may  cause  lung  damage;  no  information  available  for  long-term 
exposure to transformer oil.   

Listed as a Carcinogen/Potential Carcinogen  

Component:  Transformer Oil(a) 
In the National Toxicology Program (NTP) Report on Carcinogens 
In the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Monographs 
By the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 
(a)European Commission (EC) states transformer oil may cause cancer (see Sections 3 and 15).

This material contains organic and inorganic compounds incorporated in transformer oil (PCBs, PAHs, or other contaminants), 
which  have  been  reported  to  have  toxic,  mutagenic,  and/or  carcinogenic  properties,  and  should  be  handled  with  care.    The 
concentrations  of  these  compounds  that  are  not  listed  above  are  below  the  reportable  limit:    hazardous  components  (1 %); 
carcinogens (0.1 %), required by OSHA, 29 CFR 1910.1200 (g)(2)(i)(C)(1), for MSDS information.

4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

EC Classification Risk/Safety Phrases:  Refer to Section 15, “Regulatory Information”. 

Inhalation:    Move  the  person  to  fresh  air  immediately.    If  not  breathing,  qualified  medical  personnel  may  give 
artificial respiration or oxygen if necessary.  Seek medical aid at once, and bring the container or label. 
Skin Contact:  Remove contaminated clothing and shoes.  Flush affected skin with water for at least 15 minutes, 
and then wash thoroughly with soap or mild detergent and water.  If skin irritation persists, seek medical aid and 
bring the container or label.  Wash contaminated clothing before reusing. 
Eye Contact:  Do not allow victim to rub eyes or keep eyes closed.  Flush eyes with large amounts of running water 
for at least 15 minutes, keeping eyelids open and raising lids to remove all chemical. Seek medical aid at once, and 
bring the container or label. 
Ingestion:    Contact  a  poison  control  center  immediately  for  instructions.    Do  not  induce  vomiting.    If  vomiting 
occurs, keep head lower than hips to reduce risk of aspiration.  Seek medical aid at once, and bring the container or 
label. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Slight fire hazard. 
Extinguishing Media:  Use extinguishing media appropriate to the surrounding fire. 
Fire  Fighting:    Avoid  inhalation  of  material  or  combustion  byproducts.    Wear  full  protective  clothing  and 
NIOSH-approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA).

8.  EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

Exposure Limits 

Component:  Transformer Oil 

No occupational limits established.  

Ventilation:  Use local or general exhaust to keep employee from exposures.  Local exhaust ventilation is preferred 
because it can control contaminant emissions at the source, preventing dispersion into the general work area.  Refer 
to the ACGIH document Industrial Ventilation, a Manual of Recommended Practices. 
Respirator:    If  workplace  conditions  warrant  a  respirator,  a  respiratory  protection  program  that  meets  OSHA 
29 CFR 1910.134 must be followed.  Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators. 
Eye Protection:  Use chemical safety goggles where splashing of solutions may occur.  Provide an emergency eye 
wash fountain and safety shower in the immediate work area. 
Personal Protection:  Wear appropriate gloves and protective clothing to prevent contact with skin.
