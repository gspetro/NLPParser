(a) Hazardous components 1 % or greater; carcinogens 0.1 % or greater are listed in compliance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.1200. 
SRM 1084a contains trace amounts of 14 different metals, each in a concentration of less than 1.0% (see Certificate of Analysis 
1084a); no MSDS information is required under current OSHA regulations. 

EC Classification (assigned):  Carcinogen Category 2 

EC Hazard Symbol:  T 

EC Risk (R):  R45 

EC Safety (S):  S45, S53 

3.  HAZARDS IDENTIFICATION 

Major Health Hazards:  None listed. 

 
Potential Health Effects 

EC Risk/Safety Phrases:  See Section 15 “Regulatory Information” 

NFPA Ratings (Scale 0–4): 

 

Health = 1 

Fire = 1  

Reactivity = 0  

Inhalation:  Acute exposure by inhalation of mists of insoluble oils are not usually harmful to the respiratory 
tract.  Chronic exposure may cause fibrotic nodules and lipid pneumonia. 

Skin Contact:  Prolonged or repeated contact may result in irritation or dermatitis. 

Eye Contact:  Slight irritation with acute exposure. 

Ingestion:  Ingestion of this material is unlikely under normal laboratory conditions.  Lung damage may occur 
if aspirated into the lungs and may be fatal.  Symptoms include coughing, difficulty breathing and pulmonary 
edema.  Mineral oils may cause gastrointestinal disturbances such as diarrhea.

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing have qualified personnel give 
artificial respiration.  Get immediate medical attention. 

Skin Contact:  Wash exposed skin with soap and water for at least 15 minutes.  Remove any contaminated clothing. 

Eye  Contact:    Immediately  flush  eyes  with  copious  amounts  of  water  for  at  least  15  minutes.    Get  immediate 
medical attention. 

Ingestion:  Aspiration hazard.  If swallowed DO NOT induce vomiting.  If vomiting occurs, keep head lower than 
hips  to  prevent  aspiration.    Seek  immediate  medical  attention.    If  not  breathing  have  qualified  personnel  give 
artificial respiration. 

Extinguishing Media:  Regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide, regular foam. 

Fire Fighting:  Wear full protective clothing and NIOSH-approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA).

Ventilation:  Use a local exhaust ventilation system.  Ensure compliance with applicable exposure limits 

Respirator:    A  respiratory  protection  program  that  meet  OSHA  29  CFR  1910.134  and  ANSI  Z88.2  requirements 
must be followed if workplace conditions warrant a respirator.  Refer to the “NIOSH Guide to the Selection and Use 
of Particulate Respirators Certified under 42 CFR 84” for selection and use of respirators certified by NIOSH. 

Eye Protection:  Wear safety goggles.  An eye wash station should be readily available near areas of use. 

Personal Protection:  Wear  appropriate  protective  clothing  and  chemically  resistant  gloves  to  prevent  skin 
exposure.
