3256 
Green Tea-Containing Solid Oral Dosage Form 

Recommended Use of This Material and Restrictions of Use 

Standard Reference Material (SRM) 3256 is intended primarily for use in validating analytical methods for the 
determination of catechins, xanthines, and toxic elements in solid oral dosage forms containing green tea and in 
similar matrices.  SRM 3256 can also be used for quality assurance when assigning values to in house control 
materials.   A  unit  of  SRM  3256  consists  of  five  packets,  each  containing  approximately  2.5  g  of  powdered 
material.

Note:  This processed material is intended for laboratory use only; not for human consumption. SRM 3256 is supplied 
in  a  small  quantity  and under normal laboratory  conditions  it does not constitute  a  combustible  dust hazard.   The 
physical properties of this material indicate that accumulated dust on surfaces generated where operations produce 
fine particulates, may lead to combustible dust concentrations in air.

4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Description of First Aid Measures  

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to well-ventilated (uncontaminated) area.  If breathing is difficult, 
qualified personnel may administer oxygen.  If not breathing, qualified personnel should give artificial respiration.  
Seek immediate medical attention.  
Skin Contact:  Rinse affected skin thoroughly with soap or mild detergent and water for at least 15 minutes.   If 
skin irritation persists, seek medical aid and bring the container or label. 
Eye Contact:  Immediately flush eyes, including under the eyelids, with copious amounts of water for at least 
15 minutes.  Seek immediate medical attention. 
Ingestion:  If a large amount is swallowed, seek medical attention. 

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  No information available. 

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above 
symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Suitable:  Regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide, water, or regular foam. 
Unsuitable:  None listed. 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Avoid generating dust; sufficient concentrations of fine dust dispersed in air, and in the 
presence of an ignition source is a potential hazard. 
Extinguishing Media 
 
 
Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  Not applicable. 
Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Move container from fire area if it can be done 
without personal risk.  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion by-products.  Wear full protective clothing and 
NIOSH-approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe) 
 

Reactivity = 0 

Health = 0 

Fire = 0 

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Use suitable protective equipment; 
see Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”. 
Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Avoid generating and accumulating dust.  Collect in 
appropriate container for disposal.  

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Safe Handling Precautions:  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”. 
Storage  and  Incompatible  Materials:    Keep  separated  from  incompatible  substances  and  ignition  sources.    See  the 
Certificate of Analysis for storage information.   

8.  EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

Exposure Limits:  No occupational exposure limits established for green tea-containing powder.  OSHA lists the 
following exposure limits for Particulates Not Otherwise Regulated. 

OSHA (PEL):  15 mg/m3 TWA (total particulates) 
 

5 mg/m3 TWA (respirable particulates) 

Engineering Controls:   Provide  local  exhaust  or  process  enclosure  ventilation  system.  Ensure  compliance  with 
applicable exposure limits.

Personal Protection Measures:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal 
Protective Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material. 

Respiratory  Protection:    If workplace conditions warrant a  respirator, a  respiratory protection program that 
meets OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.   Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators. 

Eye Protection:  Splash resistant safety goggles and emergency eyewash are recommended. 

Skin and Body Protection:  Chemical resistant clothing and gloves are recommended.
