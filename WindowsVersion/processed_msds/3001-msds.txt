Description:  This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM) 
is  a  gravimetrically  prepared  single-compound 
solution (toluene)  in  methanol  intended primarily  for  the  calibration of  instrumentation  and validation  of  methods 
for volatile organic compound (VOC) determinations.  A unit of SRM 3001 consists of two 5 mL sealed borosilicate 
glass ampoules of a gravimetrically prepared solution of toluene in methanol.  Approximately 2.5 mL of this mixture 
is supplied in each 5 mL glass ampoule. 

Substance: Toluene/Methanol Solution 

Other Designations:  Methanol (Wood alcohol; wood spirit; methyl hydroxide; methyl alcohol);  
 

Toluene (methylbenzene; i-methylbenzene; methylbenzol; phenylmethane; toluol) 

2.  HAZARDS IDENTIFICATION  

NFPA Ratings (Scale 0-4):  Health = 2 

Fire = 3 

Reactivity = 0 

Major Health Hazards:  Skin, eye, and respiratory irritation, central nervous system depression, aspiration hazard, 
and nerve damage. 

Physical Hazards:  Flammable liquid and vapor.  Vapor may cause flash fire. 

Potential Health Effects (Acute and Chronic) 

Inhalation:    Methanol  can  cause  irritation  of  the  mucous  membranes,  coughing,  ringing  in  the  ears, 
constipation,  recurrent  headaches,  drowsiness,  dizziness,  tingling  sensation,  tremors,  loss  of  coordination, 
enlargement of the liver, blood disorders, oppression in the chest, tracheitis, bronchitis, tinnitus, unsteady gait, 
twitching,  colic,  nystagmus,  blepharospasm,  and  nerve  damage.    Occupational  exposure  symptoms  include 
paresthesias, numbness and shooting pains in the hands and forearms.  Metabolic acidosis and effects on the 
eyes and central nervous system may occur. 

Toluene can cause irritation, nausea, headache, drowsiness, dizziness, disorientation, sleep disturbances, loss 
of coordination, dilated pupils, kidney damage, and liver damage. 

Skin  Contact:    Methanol  can  cause  irritation;  skin  absorption  may  occur  and  cause  metabolic  acidosis  and 
effects on the eyes and central nervous system.  Repeated or prolonged contact may cause defatting of the skin 
resulting  in  erythema,  scaling,  and  eczematoid  dermatitis.    Chronic  absorption  may  result  in  headache, 
drowsiness, dizziness, loss of coordination, and blood disorders. 

Eye  Contact:    Methanol  vapors  may  cause  irritation  and  eye  damage.    Concentrated  solutions  have  been 
reported  to  cause  violent  inflammation  of  the  conjunctiva  and  epithelial  defects on  the  cornea.    Repeated  or 
prolonged contact may cause conjunctivitis. 

Ingestion:    Ingestion  of  methanol  may  result  in  mild  and  transient  inebriation  and  subsequent  drowsiness.  
Liver,  kidney,  heart,  stomach,  intestine  and  pancreatic  damage  may  also  occur.    Death  may  occur  due  to 
respiratory failure.  As little as 15 mL has caused blindness; the usual fatal dose is 60–240 mL. 

Toluene  can  cause  irritation,  nausea,  stomach  pain,  headache,  drowsiness,  dizziness,  disorientation,  sleep 
disturbances,  loss  of  coordination,  dilated  pupils,  kidney  damage,  and  liver  damage.    Potential  aspiration 
hazard if ingested.

4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration or 
oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Eye Contact:  Flush eyes with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes. Then get immediate medical attention. 

Skin Contact:  Wash skin with soap and water for at least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing and 
shoes.  Get medical attention, if needed.  Thoroughly clean and dry contaminated clothing and shoes before reuse. 

Ingestion:  Potential aspiration hazard if ingested.  If swallowed, do not induce vomiting.  Seek immediate medical 
attention. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Severe fire hazard.  Vapor/air mixtures are explosive.  The vapor is heavier than air.  
Vapors or gases may ignite at distant ignition sources and flash back. 

Extinguishing Media:  Alcohol-resistant foam, carbon dioxide, regular dry chemical, water. 

Fire  Fighting:    Avoid  inhalation  of  material  or  combustion  byproducts.    Wear  full  protective  clothing  and 
NIOSH-approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 

Note:  The data listed below is for methanol.

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Occupational  Release:    Avoid  heat,  flames,  sparks  and  other  sources of  ignition.    Do not  touch  spilled  material. 
Stop leak if possible without personal risk.  Reduce vapors with water spray.  Absorb small spills with sand or other 
non-combustible  material.    Collect  spilled  material  in  appropriate  container  for  disposal.    Remove  sources  of 
ignition.  Keep unnecessary people away, isolate hazard area and deny entry. 

Disposal:  Refer to Section 13, “Disposal Considerations”. 

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Handling  and  Storage:    Store  and  handle  in  accordance  with  all  current  regulations  and  standards.    Sealed 
ampoules  should  be  stored  in  the  dark  at  temperatures  between  10 °C  and  30 °C.    Subject  to  storage  regulations:  
U.S. OSHA 29 CFR 1910.106.  Grounding and bonding required.  Keep separated from incompatible substances.
