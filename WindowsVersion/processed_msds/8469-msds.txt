4. FIRST AID MEASURES

Description of First Aid Measures: 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  Give artificial respiration if not breathing.  Get immediate medical attention.

Skin Contact:  Wash skin with soap and water for at least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing and shoes.  Get medical attention, if needed.  Thoroughly clean and dry contaminated clothing and shoes before reuse.

Eye Contact:  Flush eyes with water for at least 15 minutes.  Then get immediate medical attention.

Ingestion:  If swallowed, drink plenty of water, do NOT induce vomiting.  Get immediate medical attention. Induce vomiting only at the instructions of a physician.  Do not give anything by mouth to unconscious or convulsive person.

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  Organochlorine pesticides cause liver and kidney damage. 

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above symptoms are present, seek medical attention if needed.

5. FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Slight fire hazard.  See Section 9, “Physical and Chemical Properties” for flammability properties.

Extinguishing Media:

		Suitable:  Regular dry chemical, water, and regular foam.

		Unsuitable:  None listed.

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  None listed.

Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion byproducts.  Wear full protective clothing and NIOSH approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA).
