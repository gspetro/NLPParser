2. HAZARDS IDENTIFICATION

Radiological Hazard  

Warning:  THIS MATERIAL SHOULD ONLY BE USED BY PERSONS QUALIFIED TO HANDLE RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL!  

	This product contains licensed radioactive material and is therefore subject to the requirements of 10 CFR Part 20 (e.g., public and occupational exposure limits, waste disposal).  At a minimum, the basic radiation safety principles of time, distance, and shielding, and appropriate radiation contamination control should be practiced to avoid/minimize any external and/or internal exposure.  Consult with your Radiation Safety office for your facility’s radiation safety requirements/precautions specific to the radionuclide(s) (including its activity and chemical/physical form) in this Radioactive SRM.

SRM 4404H is a radioactive material, Thallium201, with a total activity of approximately 500 MBq in a nitric acid solution. Thallium201 decays by electron capture.  During the decay process, Xrays and gamma rays with energies from 2 keV to 167 keV are emitted.  THIS SRM SHOULD ONLY BE USED BY PERSONS QUALIFIED TO HANDLE RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL!
