4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Description of First Aid Measures: 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  Give artificial respiration if not breathing.  
Seek immediate medical attention. 

Skin Contact:  Wash skin with soap and water for at least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing and 
shoes.    Get  immediate  medical  attention,  if  needed.    Thoroughly  clean  and  dry  contaminated  clothing  before 
reuse. 

Eye Contact:  Immediately flush eyes, including under the eyelids with copious amounts of water for at least 
15 minutes.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Ingestion:  Aspiration hazard!  Do not induce vomiting.  If vomiting occurs, keep head lower than hips to help 
prevent aspiration.  Get immediate medical attention.  Give artificial respiration if not breathing. 

Most  Important  Symptoms/Effects,  Acute  and  Delayed:    Respiratory  tract,  skin,  and  eye  irritation;  aspiration 
hazard, nervous system depression, and nerve damage.

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above 
symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Severe fire hazard.  The vapor is heavier than air.  Vapors or gases may ignite at distant 
ignition sources and flash back.  Vapor/air mixtures are explosive.  Electrostatic discharges may be generated by flow 
or agitation resulting in ignition or explosion.  See Section 9, “Physical and Chemical Properties” for flammability 
properties. 

Extinguishing Media: 
 
 

Suitable:  Regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide, water spray, regular foam. 
Unsuitable:  None listed. 

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  Thermal decomposition products: oxides of carbon, hydrocarbons. 

Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for  Fire-Fighters:  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion 
byproducts.  Wear full protective clothing and NIOSH approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe) 
 

Reactivity = 0 

Health = 2 

Fire = 3 

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Avoid heat, flames, sparks and other 
sources of ignition.  Stop leak if possible without personal risk.  Immediately contact emergency personnel.  Isolate 
hazard area, and deny entry.  Reduce vapors with water spray.   Use suitable protective equipment; see Section 8, 
“Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”. 

Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Do not touch spilled material.  Notify safety personnel 
of spills.  Absorb with sand or other non-combustible material.  Collect spilled material in appropriate container for 
disposal.  Avoid and remove sources of ignition.  Keep out of water supplies and sewers. 

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Safe  Handling  Precautions:    Open  glass  ampoules  carefully  to  prevent  contamination  and  injury.    See  Section  8, 
“Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”. 

Storage:    Store  and  handle  in  accordance  with  all  current  regulations  and  standards.    Keep  separated  from 
incompatible substances (see Section 10, “Stability and Reactivity”).  Sealed ampoules, as received, should be stored 
as indicated in the NIST Certificate of Analysis.

Symptoms Related to the Physical, Chemical and Toxicological Characteristics:  Respiratory tract, skin, and eye 
irritation; aspiration hazard, nervous system depression, and nerve damage. 

Potential Health Effects (Acute, Chronic and Delayed): 

Inhalation:  Exposure up to 100 ppm toluene may cause irritation; levels of 200 ppm to 600 ppm for up to 8 h 
caused fatigue, weakness, confusion, headache, nausea, impaired coordination and reaction time, paresthesia of 
the  skin,  euphoria,  dizziness,  and  dilated  pupils;  levels  up  to  800  ppm  caused  rapid  irritation,  nasal  mucous 
secretion, metallic taste, drowsiness, and impaired balance.  After effects including nervousness, muscular fatigue, 
and  insomnia  lasted  for  several  days.    Inhalation  of  naphthalene  vapors  may  cause  respiratory  tract  irritation, 
headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, edema, perspiration, confusion, excitement, and cancer. 

Skin Contact:  Contact with toluene may cause irritation and dermatitis due to defatting.  Repeated or prolonged 
skin contact with naphthalene may produce a dermatitis characterized by itching, redness, scaling, weeping, and 
crusting of the skin.

See health effects listed in “Potential Health Effects (Acute, Chronic and Delayed)”. 

Specific Target Organ Toxicity, Repeated Exposure:  Category 2 

Prolonged  or  repeated  exposure  to  toluene  may  cause  mucous  membrane  irritation,  vomiting,  insomnia, 
nosebleeds, chest pains, euphoria, headache, vertigo, nausea, anorexia, momentary loss of memory, loss of 
coordination  and  impairment  of  reaction  time,  tinnitus,  impaired  speech,  vision,  and/or  hearing,  alcohol 
intolerance, and petechiae and abnormal bleeding.  Volunteers exposed to 200 ppm for 6 h per day for 2 d 
showed a significant increase in heart rate.  Cardiac sensitization may occur and may result in cardiac arrest 
due  to  ventricular  fibrillation.    Repeated  inhalation  to  the  point  of  euphoria  has  caused  irreversible 
encephalopathy  with  cerebellar  ataxia,  rhythmic  limb  movements,  disequilibrium,  bizarre  behavior,
