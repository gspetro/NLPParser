4. FIRST AID MEASURES

Description of First Aid Measures: 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  Give artificial respiration if not breathing.  Get immediate medical attention.

Skin Contact:  Wash skin with soap and water for at least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing and shoes.  Get medical attention, if needed.  Thoroughly clean and dry contaminated clothing and shoes before reuse.

Eye Contact:  Flush eyes with water for at least 15 minutes.  Then get immediate medical attention.

Ingestion:  Contact local poison control center or physician immediately.  Never make an unconscious person vomit or drink fluids.  When vomiting occurs, keep head lower than hips to help prevent aspiration.  If person is unconscious, turn head to side.  Get medical attention immediately.

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  Organochlorine pesticides cause liver and kidney damage. 

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above symptoms are present, seek medical attention if needed.

5. FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Slight fire hazard.  Dust/air mixtures may ignite or explode.  See Section 9, “Physical and Chemical Properties” for flammability properties.

Extinguishing Media:

		Suitable:  Regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide, water, and regular foam.

		Unsuitable:  None listed.

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  None listed.

				Health = 3	Fire = 1	Reactivity = 0

6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Any accumulated material on surfaces should be removed and properly disposed of.  Use suitable protective equipment; see Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.

Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Do not touch spilled material.  Notify safety personnel of spills.  Absorb with sand or other non-combustible material.  Collect spilled material in appropriate container for disposal.  Isolate hazard area and deny entry.  Subject to California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (Proposition 65).  Keep out of water supplies and sewers.

7. HANDLING AND STORAGE

Safe Handling Precautions:  Minimize dust generation and accumulation on surfaces.  Routine housekeeping should be instituted to ensure that dusts do not accumulate on surfaces.  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.

Storage:  Store and handle in accordance with all current regulations and standards.  Keep separated from incompatible substances (See Section 10, “Stability and Reactivity”).

8. EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION

		Exposure Limits:  

	OSHA (PEL):	0.5 mg/m3 TWA.

		Prevent or reduce skin absorption.

	ACGIH (TLV):	0.5 mg/m3 TWA

		Skin – potential significant contribution to overall exposure by the cutaneous route.

	NIOSH (REL):	0.5 mg/m3 TWA

		50 mg/m3 IDLH

		Skin – potential for dermal absorption.

Engineering Controls:  Provide local exhaust or process enclosure ventilation system.  Ensure compliance with applicable exposure limits.

Personal Protection:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material.

Respiratory Protection:  If workplace conditions warrant a respirator, a respiratory protection program that meets OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.  Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators.

Eye/Face Protection:  Wear splash resistant safety goggles with a face shield.  An eye wash station should be readily available near areas of use.

Skin and Body Protection:  Personal protective equipment for the body should be selected based on the task being performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a specialist before handling this product.  Chemical-resistant gloves should be worn at all times when handling chemicals.

Ingestion

Symptoms Related to the Physical, Chemical and Toxicological Characteristics:  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, and headache.

Potential Health Effects (Acute, Chronic and Delayed):

Inhalation:  Lindane may be absorbed through the lungs and may produce central nervous system effects including muscle twitching, myoclonic jerking, and convulsive seizures with periods of unconsciousness.  Other symptoms of poisoning may be headache, nausea, vomiting, malaise, and dizziness.  Chronic exposure may produce symptoms of depression, sleeplessness, headache, vomiting, asthenia, sleeplessness and neurological effects.

Skin Contact:  Same symptoms as in inhalation and ingestion if sufficient amounts are absorbed through the skin.  Chronic exposure may cause dermatitis and urticarial.

Eye Contact:  May cause irritation.  Prolonged or repeated exposure may cause conjunctivitis.
