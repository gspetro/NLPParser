7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Safe Handling Precautions:  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”. 

Storage:    Store  and  handle  in  accordance  with  all  current  regulations  and  standards.    The  storage  floor  must  be 
impermeable and form a collecting basin so that, in the event of an accident spillage, the liquid cannot spread beyond 
the storage area. 

8.  EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

Exposure Limits: 

Transformer oil:  No occupational exposure limits established. 

Aroclor 1254:  NIOSH (TWA):  0.001 mg/m3 (related to 1,1'-Biphenyl, chloro derivatives) 

Engineering Controls:   Provide  local  exhaust  or  process  enclosure  ventilation  system.  Ensure  compliance  with 
applicable exposure limits. 

Personal Protection Measures:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal 
Protective Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material. 

Respiratory Protection:    If workplace conditions warrant a respirator, a respiratory protection program that 
meets  OSHA  29CFR  1910.134  must  be  followed.    Refer  to  NIOSH  42  CFR  84  for  applicable  certified 
respirators. 

Eye/Face Protection:  Wear splash resistant safety goggles with a face shield. An eye wash station should be 
readily available near areas of use. 

Skin and Body Protection:  Personal protective equipment for the body should be selected based on the task 
being performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a specialist before handling this product. 
Chemical-resistant gloves should be worn at all times when handling chemicals.
