Description:    This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  a  gravimetrically  prepared  single-compound  solution 
(tetrachloroethene  [tetrachloroethylene])  in  methanol  intended  primarily  for  the  calibration  of  instrumentation  and 
validation of methods for volatile organic compound (VOC) determinations.  Because of its miscibility with water, 
this  SRM  can  also  be  used  to  fortify  aqueous  samples  with  known  amounts  of  the  VOC.    A  unit  of  SRM 3010 
consists of two 5 mL sealed borosilicate glass ampoules of a gravimetrically prepared solution of tetrachloroethene 
cabin methanol.  Approximately 2.5 mL of this SRM mixture is supplied in each 5 mL glass ampoule.

(Tetrachloroethylene) in Methanol

Substance:  Tetrachloroethene in methanol. 

Other Designations: 

2.  HAZARDS IDENTIFICATION 

Methanol (methyl alcohol; methyl hydroxide; wood alcohol; wood spirit) 
Tetrachloroethene (tetrachloroethylene; 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethylene; perchloroethylene; PCE; PERC) 

NFPA Ratings (Scale 0–4):  Health = 2 

Fire = 3 

Reactivity = 0 

NOTE:  This tetrachloroethene in methanol solution has not been tested as a whole.  The health and physical hazard 
information are for the individual components, tetrachloroethene and methanol.  The actual effects of the solution 
may differ from the individual components. 

Major  Health  Hazards:    Skin,  eye,  and/or  respiratory  tract  irritation,  central  nervous  system  depression,  blood 
disorders,  liver  damage,  aspiration  hazard,  and  nerve  damage.    Tetrachloroethene  is  a  known  cancer  hazard  (in 
humans). 

Physical  Hazards:    Flammable  liquid  and  vapor.    Vapor  may  cause  flash  fire.    Electrostatic  charges  may  be 
generated by flow or agitation. 

Potential Health Effects (Acute and Chronic) 

Inhalation:    Methanol  may  cause  irritation,  cough,  ringing  in  the  ears,  constipation,  headache,  drowsiness, 
dizziness,  tingling  sensation,  pain  in  extremities,  tremors,  loss  of  coordination,  blood  disorders,  and  nerve 
damage.    Tetrachloroethene  can  cause  irritation,  nausea,  vomiting,  chest  pain,  difficulty  breathing,  irregular 
heartbeat,  headache,  drowsiness,  dizziness,  disorientation,  mood  swings,  loss  of  coordination,  blurred  vision, 
lung congestion, kidney damage, liver damage, and cancer. 

Skin  Contact:    Methanol  can  cause  irritation,  absorption  may  occur,  headache,  drowsiness,  dizziness,  loss  of 
coordination, and blood disorders.  Tetrachloroethene can cause irritation to the skin (possibly severe). 

Eye  Contact:    Methanol  and  tetrachloroethene  vapors  may  cause  irritation  and  eye  damage.    Repeated  or 
prolonged contact may cause conjunctivitis. 

Ingestion:  Ingestion of methanol may result in mild and transient inebriation and subsequent drowsiness.  Liver, 
kidney,  heart,  stomach,  intestine  and  pancreatic  damage  may  also  occur.    Death  may  occur  due  to  respiratory 
failure.  As little as 15 mL has caused blindness; the usual fatal dose is 60 mL to 240 mL.  Tetrachloroethene can 
cause the same effects reported in short term inhalation.

4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration or 
oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek medical attention if needed. 

Eye Contact:  Immediately flush eyes with copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes. 

Skin Contact:  Wash exposed skin with copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes.  Remove contaminated 
clothing and shoes.  Thoroughly clean and dry contaminated clothing and shoes before reuse. 

Ingestion:    Ingestion  of  this  material  is  not  likely  under  normal  conditions  of  use.    Potential  aspiration  hazard  if 
ingested.  If swallowed, seek medical attention. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Severe fire hazard.  Vapor/air mixtures are explosive.  The vapor is heavier than air.  
Vapors or gases may ignite at distant ignition sources and flash back.  Electrostatic discharges may be generated by 
flow or agitation resulting in ignition or explosion. 

Extinguishing Media:  Alcohol-resistant foam, carbon dioxide, regular dry chemical, water. 

Fire  Fighting:    Avoid  inhalation  of  material  or  combustion  by-products.    Wear  full  protective  clothing  and 
NIOSH-approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 

Note:  The data listed below is for methanol.

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Occupational Release:  Remove sources of ignition.  Do not touch spilled material.  Absorb small spills with sand 
or other non-combustible material.  Collect spilled material in appropriate container for proper disposal. 

Disposal:  Refer to Section 13, “Disposal Considerations”. 

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Storage:    Store  and  handle  in  accordance  with  all  current  regulations  and  standards.    Sealed  ampoules  should  be
