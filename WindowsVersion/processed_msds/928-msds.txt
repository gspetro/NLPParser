applicable exposure limits. 

Personal Protection:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal Protective 
Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material. 

Respiratory Protection:    If workplace conditions warrant a respirator, a respiratory protection program that 
meets  OSHA 29CFR 1910.134  must  be  followed.    Refer  to  NIOSH  42 CFR 84  for  applicable  certified 
respirators. 

Eye/Face Protection:  Wear chemical resistant safety goggles.  An eyewash station should be readily available 
near areas of use. 

Skin and Body Protection:  Personal protective equipment for the body should be selected based on the task 
being performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a specialist before handling this product.  
Chemical-resistant gloves should be worn at all times when handling chemicals.
