4. FIRST AID MEASURES

Description of First Aid Measures: 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration or oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention.

Skin Contact:  Wash skin with soap and water for at least 15 minutes.  Thoroughly clean and dry contaminated clothing before reuse.

Eye Contact:  Flush eyes with water for at least 15 minutes.  If necessary, seek medical attention.

Ingestion:  If a large amount is swallowed, get medical attention.

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  May cause irritation. 

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above symptoms are present, seek medical attention if needed.

5. FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Negligible fire hazard.  See Section 9, “Physical and Chemical Properties” for flammability properties.

Extinguishing Media:

		Suitable:  Use extinguishing agents appropriate for surrounding fire.

		Unsuitable:  None listed.

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  None listed.

Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion byproducts.  Wear full protective clothing and NIOSH approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA).

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe)	

				Health = 0	Fire = 0	Reactivity = 0

6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Use suitable protective equipment; see Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.

Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Collect spilled material in appropriate container for disposal.  Avoid generating dust.

7. HANDLING AND STORAGE

Safe Handling Precautions:  Minimize dust generation.  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.

Storage:  Store the unused portion of this material in the original tightlycapped bottle in a dry environment at normal laboratory temperatures.  Store and handling in accordance with all current regulations and standards.  Keep separated from incompatible substances (see Section 10, “Stability and Reactivity”).

8. EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION

Exposure Limits:  No occupational exposure limits have been established for nicotinic acid.  This material is a particulate matter and adequate inhalation/respiratory protection should be used to minimize exposure.  OSHA Particulates Not Otherwise Regulated (PNOR) exposure limits apply.

	OSHA (PEL):	15 mg/m3 (TWA, total dust)

		5 mg/m3 (TWA, respirable fraction)

	NIOSH (REL):	15 mg/m3 (TWA, total dust)

		5 mg/m3 (TWA, respirable fraction)

Engineering Controls:  Provide local exhaust or process enclosure ventilation system.  Ensure compliance with applicable exposure limits.

Personal Protection:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material.

Respiratory Protection:  If workplace conditions warrant a respirator, a respiratory protection program that meets OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.  Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators.

Eye/Face Protection:  Wear splash resistant safety goggles with a face shield.  An eye wash station should be readily available near areas of use.

Skin and Body Protection:  Personal protective equipment for the body should be selected based on the task being performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a specialist before handling this product.  Chemical-resistant gloves should be worn at all times when handling chemicals.
