4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

 
Inhalation:  Move the person to fresh air immediately.  If not breathing, qualified medical personnel may start CPR 
or give oxygen if necessary.  Get medical aid at once, and bring the container or label. 

Skin Contact:  Remove contaminated clothing and shoes.  Flush affected skin with water for at least 15 minutes, 
then  wash  thoroughly  with  soap  and  water.    If  skin  irritation  persists,  get  medical  aid  and  bring  the  container  or 
label.  Wash contaminated clothing before reusing. 

Eye Contact:  Remove contact lenses (if any).  Do not allow victim to rub eyes or keep eyes closed.  Flush eyes 
with  large  amounts  of  running  water  for  at  least  30  minutes,  keeping  eyelids  open  and  raising  lids  to  remove  all 
chemical.  Get medical aid at once, and bring the container or label.   

Ingestion:  Contact a poison control center immediately for instructions.  Wash out mouth with water, but do not 
induce vomiting.  Get medical aid at once, and bring the container or label. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

 
Fire and Explosion Hazards:  This material is not believed to be a significant fire hazard under normal conditions.  
Dust-air mixtures may explode if an ignition source is present.  Products of thermal decomposition may be toxic.   

Extinguishing  Media:   Use extinguishing media  appropriate  to  the  surrounding  fire,  such  as  water  spray,  carbon 
dioxide, dry chemical, or foam.  Cool containers from maximum distance using water spray. 

Fire Fighting:  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion byproducts.  Wear full protective clothing and NIOSH-
approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 

Flash Point (°C):  N/A 

Autoignition (°C):  N/A 

Lower Explosive Limit (LEL):  N/A 

Upper Explosive Limit (UEL):  N/A 

Flammability Class (OSHA):  N/A 

Products of Combustion:  Thermal decomposition of this material may produce carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, 
and zinc oxide. 

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

 
Occupational  Release:   Isolate  the  spill  area  and  remove  any  sources  of  ignition.    Cleanup  personnel  must  wear 
personal protective equipment (“Section 8”).  Sweep up material and place in a suitable container for reclamation or 
disposal, using a method that does not generate dust.  Provide ventilation. 
 
Disposal:  Refer to “Section 13”, Disposal Considerations.

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

 
Storage:    Store  this  material  in  the  original  container  at  room  temperature.    Protect  from  moisture,  heat,  and 
physical damage, and isolate from incompatible materials.   

Safe Handling Precautions:  Wear a dust mask or respirator.  Avoid contact or wash after handling. 

8.  EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

Exposure Limits:  None established.  Exposure limits for total nuisance dust: 
  ACGIH TLV-TWA:  None established.  Total dust, 10 mg/m3; respirable dust, 3 mg/m3  
  OSHA TLV-TWA:  None established.  Total dust, 15 mg/m3; respirable dust, 5 mg/m3  
  UK WEL: None established. Total inhalable dust, 10 mg/m3; respirable dust, 4 mg/m3 

Ventilation:  Use local or general exhaust to keep employee exposures below limits.  Local exhaust ventilation is 
preferred because  it  can  control  contaminant  emissions  at  the  source, preventing  dispersion  into  the  general  work 
area.  Refer to the ACGIH document Industrial Ventilation, a Manual of Recommended Practices. 

Respirator:  If necessary, refer to the NIOSH document Guide to the Selection and Use of Particulate Respirators 
Certified under 42 CFR 84 for selection and use of respirators certified by NIOSH. 

Eye  Protection:    Use  chemical  safety  goggles  where  dusting  or  splashing  of  solutions  may  occur.    See  OSHA 
standard (29 CFR 1910.133) or European Standard EN166.  The employer should provide an emergency eye wash 
fountain and safety shower in the immediate work area. 
Personal Protection:  Wear appropriate gloves and protective clothing to prevent contact with skin.
