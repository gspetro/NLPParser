4. FIRST AID MEASURES 

Description of First Aid Measures:  

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration 
or oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Skin Contact:  Wash skin with soap and water for at least 15 minutes.  If necessary, seek medical attention. 

Eye Contact:  Flush eyes with water for at least 15 minutes.  If necessary, seek medical attention. 

Ingestion:  If a large amount is swallowed, get medical attention. 

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  Coughing, respiratory effects (pulmonary inflammation). 

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above 
symptoms are present or suspected, seek medical attention if needed. 

5. FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire  and  Explosion  Hazards:    Slight  fire  hazard.    Dust  may  form  explosive  mixtures  with  air.    See  Section 9, 
“Physical and Chemical Properties” for flammability properties. 

Extinguishing Media: 
 
 

Suitable:  Regular dry chemical; carbon dioxide; water; regular foam. 
Unsuitable:  High-volume water streams. 

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  None listed. 

Special  Protective  Equipment and  Precautions  for  Fire-Fighters:   Avoid  inhalation  of  material  or  combustion 
byproducts.  Wear full protective clothing and NIOSH approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe) 

 

 

Health = 1 

Fire = 1 

Reactivity = 0 

6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Any accumulated material on surfaces 
should be removed and properly disposed of.  Keep unnecessary personnel away.  Use suitable protective equipment; 
see Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”. 

Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Notify safety personnel of spills.  Collect spilled material 
in appropriate container for disposal.  Isolate hazard area and deny entry.  Prevent discharge to natural waters, sewers 
and biological waste water treatment plants. 

7. HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Safe Handling Precautions:  Minimize dust generation and accumulation on surfaces.  Routine housekeeping should 
be instituted to ensure that dust does not accumulate on surfaces.  Avoid generating dust.  See Section 8, “Exposure 
Controls and Personal Protection”. 

Storage:    Store  and  handle  in  accordance  with  all  current  regulations  and  standards.    Keep  separated  from 
incompatible substances (see Section 10, “Stability and Reactivity”). 

8. EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

Exposure Limits for Graphite 

OSHA (PEL) 

TWA:  15 mppcf (natural) 
TWA:  15 mg/m3 (synthetic, total dust) 
TWA:  5 mg/m3 (synthetic, respirable fraction) 

ACGIH (TLV) 

NIOSH (REL) 

TWA:  2.5 mg/m3 (natural, respirable dust) 
IDLH:  1250 mg/m3 

TWA:  2 mg/m3 (all forms, except graphite fibers, respirable fraction) 

RM 8541

Engineering  Controls:    Provide  local  exhaust  or  process  enclosure  ventilation  system.    Ensure  compliance  with 
applicable exposure limits. 

Personal Protection:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal Protective 
Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material. 

Respiratory Protection:  At a minimum wear a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) 
certified  air-purifying  tight-fitting  full-face  respirator  with  N-100  cartridge  or  equivalent  in  accordance  with 
respiratory  protection  requirements  specified  in  OSHA  29  CFR  1910.134  and  NIOSH  42  CFR  84  whenever 
exposure to the product by inhalation is possible. 

Eye/Face Protection:  Wear chemical goggles or safety glasses at all times unless the NIOSH full-face respirator 
discussed immediately above is being worn.  The respirator’s mask provides appropriate eye.  An eyewash station 
should be readily available near areas of use. 

Skin and Body Protection:  Personal protective equipment for the body should be selected based on the task 
being performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a specialist before handling this product.
