L-glutamic Acid USGS41 

Recommended Use of This Material and Restrictions of Use 

This Reference Material (RM) is intended to aid in normalizing isotope-amount ratio data as well as developing 
and  validating  methods  for  measuring  the  relative  differences  in  carbon  (C)  and  nitrogen  (N)  isotope-amount 
ratios  in  biological  materials.    A  unit  of  RM  8574  consists  of  one  bottle  containing  approximately  0.5  g  of 
L-glutamic acid.

4. FIRST AID MEASURES 

Description of First Aid Measures:  

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration 
or oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Skin Contact:  Wash skin with soap and water for at least 15 minutes.  Thoroughly clean and dry contaminated 
clothing before reuse. 

Eye Contact:  Flush eyes with water for at least 15 minutes.  If necessary, seek medical attention. 

Ingestion:  If a large amount is swallowed, get medical attention. 

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  May irritate the eyes and skin. 

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above 
symptoms are present, seek medical attention if needed. 

5. FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Slight fire hazard.  Sufficient concentrations of dust/air mixtures may ignite or explode.  
See Section 9, “Physical and Chemical Properties” for flammability properties. 

Extinguishing Media: 
 
 

Suitable:  Regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide, water, regular foam. 
Unsuitable:  None listed. 

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  None listed. 

Special  Protective  Equipment  and  Precautions  for  Fire-Fighters:    Avoid  inhalation  of  material  or  combustion 
byproducts.  Wear full protective clothing and NIOSH approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe) 

 

 

Health = 0 

Fire = 0 

Reactivity = 0 

6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Use suitable protective equipment; see 
Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”. 

Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Avoid generating and accumulating dust.  Collect spilled 
material in appropriate container for disposal. 

7. HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Safe Handling Precautions:  Minimize dust generation.  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”. 

Storage:    Store  and  handling  in  accordance  with  all  current  regulations  and  standards.    Keep  separated  from 
incompatible substances (See Section 10, “Stability and Reactivity”). 

8. EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

Exposure Limits:  No occupational exposure limits established for glutamic acid.  OSHA lists the following exposure 
limits for Particles Not Otherwise Regulated.    

OSHA (PEL):  15 mg/m3 TWA (total particulates) 
 

5 mg/m3 TWA (respirable particulates) 

Engineering  Controls:    Provide  local  exhaust  or  process  enclosure  ventilation  system.    Ensure  compliance  with 
applicable exposure limits. 

Personal Protection:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal Protective 
Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material. 

Respiratory Protection:  If workplace conditions  warrant a respirator, a respiratory protection program that 
meets  OSHA  29CFR  1910.134  must  be  followed.    Refer  to  NIOSH  42  CFR  84  for  applicable  certified 
respirators.

Eye/Face Protection:  Wear splash resistant safety goggles with a face shield.  An eye wash station should be 
readily available near areas of use. 

Skin and Body Protection:  Personal protective equipment for the body should be selected based on the task 
being performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a specialist before handling this product.  
Chemical-resistant gloves should be worn at all times when handling chemicals.
