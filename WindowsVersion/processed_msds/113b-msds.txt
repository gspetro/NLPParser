	Recommended Use of This Material and Restrictions of Use

This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended primarily for use in the analysis of zinc sulfide ores and concentrates.  SRM 113b is in the form of a fine powder, and is packaged in an inert argon atmosphere to prevent air oxidation of the material, which would lead to changes in the certified values over time.  A unit of SRM 113b consists of a bottle containing 100 g of the powdered concentrate.

Ingestion

Symptoms Related to the Physical, Chemical and Toxicological Characteristics:  Respiratory tract irritation, skin irritation, and eye irritation, abnormal lung function, kidney damage, and cancer.

Potential Health Effects (Acute, Chronic, and Delayed)

	Inhalation:

	Zinc sulfide:  Acute exposure may result in irritation of the mucous membranes, diarrhea, nausea, palpitations, headache, convulsions and respiratory failure.  Chronic exposure may result in an irregular heartbeat and weight loss.

	Iron sulfide:  Inhalation of the dust or mists of soluble iron salts may be irritating to the respiratory tract.

	Lead sulfide:  Absorption of large amounts of lead may cause a metallic taste, thirst, vomiting, delirium, visual failure, and paralysis.  Prolonged or repeated exposure to low levels of lead may result in an accumulation in body tissues and exert adverse effects on the blood, nervous systems, heart, endocrine and immune systems, kidneys and reproductive system.

	Cadmium sulfide:  Cadmium is highly cumulative and respiratory effects from repeated or prolonged exposure to dusts or fumes may include respiratory cancers, irreversible kidney damage, ulceration of the nasal septum, teeth discoloration, and abnormal lung function.

	Skin Contact:  Contact with this powder or generated dust may result in papulovesicular lesions with exfoliation, green discoloration of the skin, redness, pain, and irritation.  Prolonged exposure may lead to dermatitis with erythematous.

	Eye Contact:  Generated dust may cause mechanical irritation with redness and pain; a local brown discoloration may occur.  Repeated exposure may cause conjunctivitis.

Ingestion:

Zinc sulfide:  Ingestion may cause burning in the mouth and throat, vomiting, watery or bloody diarrhea, hypotension, and convulsions.  Chronic exposure may result in liver and kidney damage.

Iron sulfide:  Ingestion may cause nausea, vomiting, heartburn, constipation and diarrhea.  Chronic excessive iron intake can lead to hemosiderosis with possible damage to the liver and pancreas.

Lead sulfide:  Ingestion of a large amount or repeated or prolonged exposure of lead may cause accumulation in body tissues and result the same effects as detailed in lead inhalation.

Cadmium sulfide:  Ingestion may result severe nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, blurred vision, headache, liver damage, and kidney damage.
