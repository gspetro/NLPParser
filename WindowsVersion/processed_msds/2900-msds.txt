4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Description of First Aid Measures: 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration 
or oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Skin Contact:    Rinse  affected  area  with  soap  and  water  for  at  least  15  minutes.    Seek  medical  assistance  if 
necessary. 

Eye Contact:  Immediately flush eyes, including under the eyelids with copious amounts of water for at least 15 
minutes.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Ingestion:  Contact a poison control center immediately for instructions.  Give water to rinse out mouth.  Never 
give liquids to a person with reduced awareness or becoming unconscious.  If vomiting occurs, keep head lower 
than hips to prevent aspiration.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate 
medical attention. 

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  Respiratory tract irritation, skin irritation, eye irritation, 
liver damage, and central nervous system depression. 

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above 
symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention.   

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Severe fire hazard.  Vapor is heavier than air.  Vapors or gases may ignite at distant 
ignition sources and flash back.  Vapor/air mixtures are explosive above flash point.   See Section 9, “Physical  and 
Chemical Properties” for flammability properties. 

Extinguishing Media: 
 
 

Suitable:  Regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide, fine water spray, and alcohol resistant foam. 
Unsuitable:  None listed. 

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  Thermal decomposition will form oxides of carbon. 

Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion 
byproducts.  Wear full protective clothing and NIOSH approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe) 
 

Reactivity = 0 

Health = 2 

Fire = 3 

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Personal  Precautions,  Protective  Equipment  and  Emergency  Procedures:    Immediately  contact  emergency 
personnel.  Keep unnecessary personnel away.  Use suitable protective equipment; see Section 8, “Exposure Controls 
and Personal Protection”. 

Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Do not touch spilled material.  Notify safety personnel 
of spills.  Absorb with sand or other non-combustible material.  Collect spilled material in appropriate container for 
disposal.  Isolate hazard area and deny entry.

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Safe Handling Precautions:  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.  Handle glass ampoules 
with care. 

Storage:  Store and handle in accordance with all current regulations and standards.  Sealed ampoules, as received, 
should be stored in the stored in the dark at temperatures between 10 °C and 30 °C.  Keep separated from incompatible 
substances. 

8.  EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

Exposure Limits: 

1000 ppm TWA or 1900 mg/m3 TWA 

OSHA (PEL): 
ACGIH (TLV):  1000 ppm STEL 
NIOSH (REL): 
 

1000 ppm TWA or 1900 mg/m3 TWA 
3300 ppm IDLH (10 % LEL) 

Engineering Controls:   Provide  local  exhaust  or  process  enclosure  ventilation  system.  Ensure  compliance  with 
applicable exposure limits. 

Personal Protection:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal Protective 
Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material. 

Respiratory Protection:    If workplace conditions warrant a respirator, a respiratory protection program that 
meets  OSHA  29CFR  1910.134  must  be  followed.    Refer  to  NIOSH  42  CFR  84  for  applicable  certified 
respirators. 

Eye/Face Protection:  Wear splash resistant safety goggles with a face shield. An eye wash station should be 
readily available near areas of use. 

Skin and Body Protection:  Personal protective equipment for the body should be selected based on the task 
being performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a specialist before handling this product.  
Chemical-resistant gloves should be worn at all times when handling chemicals.
