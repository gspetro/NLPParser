Description:  This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended primarily for use as a primary standard for the 
calibration of  instruments  used  for  the  determination  of  the  oxygen  content  of  motor  fuels.    A  unit  of  SRM 2289 
consists  of  two  ampoules  of  solution  of  t-amyl-methyl ether  in  reference  gasoline  and  one  ampoule  of  reference 
gasoline without the t-amyl-methyl ether to use as a blank.  Each 20 mL ampoule contains approximately 18 mL of 
solution. 

Substance:  Gasoline and gasoline with t-amyl-methyl ether.  

Other Designations: 
Gasoline (gasoline, unleaded; motor spirits; petrol; mid-grade gasoline; “A” grade gasoline [NRCA]). 
t-Amyl-methyl ether  (2-methoxy-methylbutane;  1,1,-dimethylpropyl  methyl  ether;  2-methyly-2-methoxy  butane; 
methyl 1,1-dimethylpropyl ether; methyl tert-butyl amyl ether; TAME; tert-amyl methyl ether). 

2.  HAZARDS IDENTIFICATION 

NFPA Ratings (Scale 0–4): 

Health = 1 

Fire = 3 

Reactivity = 0 

Note:    The  two  different  formulations  (gasoline  and  gasoline  with  t-amyl-methyl  ether)  have  many  of  the  same 
physical properties and present similar health hazards to the user.  This MSDS applies to both formulations unless 
otherwise  noted.    Gasoline  contains  many  different  components  at  varying  concentrations  (See  Section 3, 
“Composition and Information on Hazardous Ingredients”). 

Major Health Hazards:  Potentially fatal on contact with the skin, harmful if swallowed, respiratory tract irritation, 
skin  irritation,  eye  irritation,  aspiration  hazard,  blood  damage,  liver  damage,  central  nervous  system  depression, 
nerve damage, and cancer. 

Physical Hazards:  Extremely flammable liquid and vapor.  Vapor may cause flash fire. 

Potential Health Effects (Acute and Chronic) 

Inhalation:    Irritation,  ringing  in  ears,  nausea,  vomiting,  chest  pain,  difficulty  breathing,  irregular  heartbeat, 
headache,  drowsiness,  symptoms  of  drunkenness,  disorientation,  visual  disturbances,  lung  congestions,  blood 
disorders, paralysis, convulsions, and coma.  Long-term effects may include hearing loss, kidney damage, nerve 
damage, reproductive effects, brain damage, and cancer. 

Skin  Contact:    Short-term  contact  may  cause  irritation,  blisters,  rash, and kidney  damage;  long-term  contact 
may cause burns and tingling sensation. 

Eye Contact:  Tearing and irritation. 

Ingestion:    Vomiting,  digestive  disorders,  chest  pain,  difficulty  breathing,  irregular  heartbeat,  headache, 
drowsiness, symptoms of drunkenness, disorientation, visual disturbances, dilated pupils, bluish skin color, lung 
congestion,  lung  damage,  liver  damage,  paralysis,  convulsions,  and  coma.    Long-term  effects  may  include 
impotence and cancer.

4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration by 
qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Skin  Contact:    Rinse  affected  area  with  soap  and  water  for  at  least  15 minutes.    Seek  medical  assistance  if 
necessary. 

Eye  Contact:    Immediately  flush  eyes,  including  under  the  eyelids,  with  copious  amounts  of  water  for  at  least 
15 minutes.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Ingestion:    Contact  local  position  control  center  or  physician  immediately.    Never  make  an  unconscious  person 
vomit  or  drink  fluids.    If  vomiting  occurs,  keep  head  lower  than  hips  to  help  prevent  aspiration.    If  person  is 
unconscious, turn head to side.  Get help immediately. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Severe fire hazard.  The vapor is heavier than air.  Vapors or gases may ignite at 
distant ignition sources and flash back.  Vapor/air mixtures are explosive. 

Extinguishing Media:  Regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide, fine water spray, and regular foam. 

Fire Fighting:  Avoid inhalation of combustion by-products. 

Flash Point:  –45 C (–49 F) 
Method Used:  Estimate. 

Autoignition Temperature:  280 C to 456 C (536 F to 853 F)
