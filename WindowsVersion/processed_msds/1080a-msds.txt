4. FIRST AID MEASURES

Description of First Aid Measures 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to wellventilated (uncontaminated) area.  If breathing is difficult, qualified personnel may administer oxygen.  If not breathing, qualified personnel should give artificial respiration.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Skin Contact:  Rinse affected skin thoroughly with soap or mild detergent and water for at least 15 minutes.  If skin irritation persists, seek medical aid and bring the container or label.

Eye Contact:  Immediately flush eyes, including under the eyelids, with copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes.  Seek immediate medical attention.

Ingestion:  If a large amount is swallowed, seek medical attention.

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  No information available.

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention.

5. FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Negligible fire hazard.

Extinguishing Media

		Suitable:  Use extinguishing media appropriate for the surrounding fire.

		Unsuitable:  None listed.

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  Oxides of carbon, copper oxides.

Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Move container from fire area if it can be done without personal risk.  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion byproducts.  Wear full protective clothing and NIOSHapproved selfcontained breathing apparatus (SCBA).

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe)

				Health = 0	Fire = 0	Reactivity = 0

6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Use suitable protective equipment; see Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.

Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Avoid generating and accumulating dust.  Collect in appropriate container for disposal. 

7. HANDLING AND STORAGE

Safe Handling Precautions:  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.

	Storage and Incompatible Materials:  Keep separated from incompatible substances and ignition sources.

8. EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION

		Exposure Limits There are no OSHA occupational exposure limits available.  Exposure limits are listed for copper dust and mist, related to copper compounds, n.o.s.

		ACGIH (TLV):	1 mg/m3 TWA

		NIOSH (REL):	1 mg/m3 TWA

			100 mg/m3 IDLH

Engineering Controls:  Provide local exhaust or process enclosure ventilation system.  Ensure compliance with applicable exposure limits.

Personal Protection Measures:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material.

Respiratory Protection:  If workplace conditions warrant a respirator, a respiratory protection program that meets OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.  Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators.

Eye Protection:  Splash resistant safety goggles and emergency eyewash are recommended.

Skin and Body Protection:  Chemical resistant clothing and gloves are recommended.
