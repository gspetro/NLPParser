Description:  This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended to be used to evaluate upholstery fabrics for their 
tendency  to  support  smoldering  combustion.    The  evaluation  metric  is  the  percent  mass  loss  of  the  polyurethane 
foam after the specimen assembly is exposed to a burning SRM 1196 cigarette for 45 minutes.  A unit of SRM 1202 
is  a  single  test  specimen,  which  consists  of  two  pieces  of  a  reproducibly  high  smoldering  standard  polyurethane 
foam,  two  pieces  of  denim  upholstery  fabric,  a  piece  of  cotton  fabric,  and  one  pack  of  SRM 1196  cigarettes 
containing 20 cigarettes. 
Substance:  Carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2), and other oxides of carbon. 
Other Designations:  Not applicable for this material. 

2.  HAZARDS IDENTIFICATION 

NFPA Ratings (Scale 0–4): 

Health = 2 

Fire = 1 

Reactivity = 0 

Note:    This  MSDS  addresses  the  CO  and  CO2  gas  generated  from  the  smoldering  fabric  and  foam.    The 
concentration of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide generated as a combustion product are unknown, and while 
expected to be small, pose health hazards.  These gases are not under pressure.  This MSDS is for carbon monoxide 
and carbon dioxide and is provided for information to the user. 

Major  Health  Hazards:    Carbon  monoxide  is  harmful  if  inhaled,  may  cause  blood  damage,  and  suffocation.  
Carbon dioxide may cause difficulty breathing. 

Physical Hazards:  There are no physical hazards associated with this material. 

Potential Health Effects (Acute and Chronic) 

Inhalation:    CO  and  CO2  may  cause  suffocation  and  exposure  effects  include  changes  in  body  temperature, 
changes  in  blood  pressure,  nausea,  vomiting,  chest  pain,  difficulty  breathing,  irregular  heartbeat,  headache, 
drowsiness,  visual  disturbances,  pain  in  extremities,  tremors,  loss  of  coordination,  hearing  loss,  visual 
disturbances, eye damage, blood disorders, unconsciousness, coma, and death.  CO exposure may also include 
convulsions. 
Skin Contact:  No information available. 
Eye Contact:  No information available. 
Ingestion:  Ingestion of a gas is unlikely.

Note:    The  fume  from  the  smoldering  material  is  a  complex  mixture  that  has  not  been  tested  as  a  whole.    The 
material contains organic and inorganic compounds incorporated in the matrix (see Certificate of Analysis), which 
have been reported to have toxic, mutagenic, and/or carcinogenic properties, and should be handled with care.
