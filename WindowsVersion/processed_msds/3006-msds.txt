Description:    This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  a  gravimetrically  prepared  single-compound  solution 
(carbon  tetrachloride)  in  methanol  intended  primarily  for  the  calibration  of  instrumentation  and  validation  of 
methods for volatile organic compound (VOC) determinations.  A unit of SRM 3006 consists of two 5 mL sealed 
borosilicate  glass  ampoules  of  a  gravimetrically  prepared  solution  of  carbon  tetrachloride  in  methanol.  
Approximately 2.5 mL of this mixture is supplied in each 5 mL glass ampoule. 

Substance:  Carbon Tetrachloride in Methanol. 

Other Designations: 

2.  HAZARDS IDENTIFICATION 

Methanol (methyl alcohol; methyl hydroxide; wood alcohol; wood spirit). 
Carbon tetrachloride (perchloromethane; carbon chloride (CCl4); tetrachloromethane; benzinoform). 

NFPA Ratings (Scale 0–4):  Health = 2 

Fire = 3 

Reactivity = 0 

NOTE:    This  carbon  tetrachloride  in  methanol  solution  has  not  been  tested  as  a  whole.    The  health  and  physical 
hazard information are for carbon tetrachloride and methanol.  The actual effects of the solution may differ from the 
individual components. 

Major  Health  Hazards:    Skin,  eye,  and  respiratory  tract  irritation,  central  nervous  system  depression,  nerve 
damage, aspiration hazard.  Possible carcinogen. 

Physical  Hazards:    Flammable  liquid  and  vapor.    Vapor  may  cause  flash  fire.    Electrostatic  charges  may  be 
generated by flow or agitation. 

Potential Health Effects (Acute and Chronic): 

Inhalation:    Methanol  may  cause  irritation,  cough,  ringing  in  the  ears,  constipation,  headache,  drowsiness, 
dizziness,  tingling  sensation,  pain  in  extremities,  tremors,  loss  of  coordination,  blood  disorders,  and  nerve 
damage.    Carbon  tetrachloride  may  cause  irritation;  exposure  to  25–117 ppm  may  cause  nausea,  headache, 
dizziness, depression, narcosis, dyspepsia visual disturbances, and liver damage.  Repeated exposure may cause 
the same effects as acute exposure. 

Skin  Contact:    Methanol  can  cause  irritation,  absorption  may  occur,  headache,  drowsiness,  dizziness,  loss  of 
coordination, and blood disorders.  Carbon tetrachloride may cause irritation and toxic amounts may be absorbed 
through  the  skin  which  may  cause  nausea,  headache,  dizziness,  depression,  narcosis,  dyspepsia,  visual 
disturbances, and liver damage. 

Eye  Contact:    Vapors  may  cause  irritation  and  eye  damage.    Repeated  or  prolonged  contact  may  cause 
conjunctivitis.  Carbon tetrachloride may cause irritation. 

Ingestion:    Ingestion  of  methanol  may  result  in  mild  and  transient  inebriation,  and  subsequent  drowsiness.  
Liver,  kidney,  heart,  stomach,  intestine  and  pancreatic  damage  may  also  occur.    Death  may  occur  due  to 
respiratory  failure.    As  little  as  15 mL  has  caused  blindness;  the  usual  fatal  dose  is  60–240 mL.    Ingestion  of 
carbon tetrachloride may cause nausea, headache, dizziness, depression, narcosis, dyspepsia, visual disturbances, 
and liver damage.

4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration or 
oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek medical attention if needed. 

Eye Contact:  Immediately flush eyes with copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes. 

Skin Contact:  Wash exposed skin with copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes.  Remove contaminated 
clothing and shoes.  Thoroughly clean and dry contaminated clothing and shoes before reuse. 

Ingestion:    Ingestion  of  this  material  is  not  likely  under  normal  conditions  of  use.    Potential  aspiration  hazard  if 
ingested.  If swallowed, seek medical attention. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Severe fire hazard.  Vapor/air mixtures are explosive.  The vapor is heavier than air.  
Vapors or gases may ignite at distant ignition sources and flash back.  Electrostatic discharges may be generated by 
flow or agitation resulting in ignition or explosion. 

Extinguishing Media:  Alcohol-resistant foam, carbon dioxide, regular dry chemical, water. 

Fire  Fighting:    Avoid  inhalation  of  material  or  combustion  by-products.    Wear  full  protective  clothing  and 
NIOSH-approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA).
