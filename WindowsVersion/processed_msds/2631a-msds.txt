Nitric Oxide in Nitrogen (Nominal Amount-of-Substance Fraction 3000 µmol/mol) 

Recommended Use of This Material and Restrictions of Use 

This  Standard  Reference  Material  (SRM)  is  a  primary  gas  mixture  of  nitric  oxide  in  nitrogen  supplied  in  a 
DOT 3AL-specification aluminum (6061 alloy) cylinder with a water volume of 6 L.  Mixtures are shipped with 
a nominal pressure exceeding 12.4 MPa (1800 psig), which provides the user with 0.73 m3 (25.8 ft3) of useable

4. FIRST AID MEASURES 

Description of First Aid Measures:  

Skin Contact:  Not applicable. 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration 
or oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Eye Contact:  Immediately flush eyes, including under the eyelids with copious amounts of water for at least 15 
minutes.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Ingestion:  Ingestion of a gas is unlikely. 

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  Potentially fatal if inhaled, blood damage, respiratory 
tract irritation, skin irritation, eye irritation. 

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above 
symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention.   

5. FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire  and  Explosion Hazards:    Negligible fire  hazard  applicable  to  the  identified NIST  cylinder.   Cylinders  may 
rupture or explode if exposed to heat.  See Section 9, “Physical and Chemical Properties” for flammability properties. 

Extinguishing Media: 
 
 

Suitable:  Use extinguishing media appropriate to the surrounding fire. 
Unsuitable:  None listed. 

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  Oxides of nitrogen. 

Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Move cylinder from fire area if it can be done 
without personal risk.  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion byproducts.  Wear full protective clothing and 
NIOSH approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA).

Ingestion 

Symptoms Related to the Physical, Chemical and Toxicological Characteristics:  Nausea, headache, weakness, 
drowsiness. 

Potential Health Effects (Acute, Chronic, and Delayed): 

Inhalation:   
Nitric  oxide:    Acute  exposure  to  nitric  oxide  at  low  concentrations  in  a  one-time  exposure  may  cause  mild 
coughing,  respiratory  tract  irritation,  fatigue,  headache,  nausea,  and  vomiting  choking  abdominal  pain,  and 
dyspnea.  Exposure to 25 ppm for 60 minutes may cause irritation and minor chest pain; 50 ppm may lead to 
pulmonary edema with possible recovery; 100 ppm may cause pulmonary edema and death. 

Nitrogen:    Nitrogen  compressed  gas  is  a  simple  asphyxiant.    Release  in  an  enclosed  space  may  result  in 
asphyxiation.  The symptoms of asphyxia depend on the rapidity with which the oxygen deficiency develops and 
how long it continues.  In sudden acute asphyxia, unconsciousness may be immediate.  With slow development, 
there may be rapid respiration and pulse, air hunger, dizziness, reduced awareness, tightness in the head, tingling 
sensations, incoordination, faulty judgment, emotional instability, and rapid fatigue.  As the asphyxia progresses, 
nausea, vomiting, collapse, unconsciousness, convulsions, deep coma, and death are possible.  

Skin Contact:  Nitric oxide at low concentrations may cause skin irritation. 

Eye Contact:  Nitric oxide at low concentrations in air may cause a stinging sensation of the eyes.  Not applicable 
for exposure to nitrogen. 

Ingestion:  Ingestion of a gas is unlikely under normal conditions of use. 

Numerical Measures of Toxicity:  

Acute Toxicity:  Category 4, Inhalation. 

Nitric oxide: Rat, Inhalation LC50:  1068 mg/m3 (4 h); 115 ppm (1 h)  
Nitrogen: Simple asphyxiant.
