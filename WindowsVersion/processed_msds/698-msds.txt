4. FIRST AID MEASURES 

Description of First Aid Measures:  

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration 
or oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention. 
Skin Contact:  Wash skin with soap and water. 
Eye Contact:  Flush eyes with water for at least 15 minutes.  If necessary, seek medical attention. 
Ingestion:  If adverse effects occur after ingestion, seek medical treatment. 

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  Mechanical irritation of the skin and eyes 

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above 
symptoms are present, seek medical attention if needed. 

5. FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Negligible fire hazard.  Avoid generating dust.  See Section 9, “Physical and Chemical 
Properties” for flammability properties. 

Extinguishing Media: 
 
 

Suitable:  Regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide, water, regular foam. 
Unsuitable:  None listed. 

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  None listed. 

Special  Protective  Equipment  and  Precautions  for  Fire-Fighters:    Avoid  inhalation  of  material  or  combustion 
byproducts.  Wear full protective clothing and NIOSH approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe) 
 

Reactivity = 0 

Health = 1 

Fire = 0 

6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Any accumulated material on surfaces 
should be removed and properly disposed of.  Use suitable protective equipment; see Section 8, “Exposure Controls 
and Personal Protection”. 

Methods  and  Materials  for  Containment  and  Clean  up:    Collect  spilled  material  in  appropriate  container  for 
disposal.  Keep out of water supplies and sewers.  Keep unnecessary people away, isolate hazard area and deny entry. 

7. HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Safe Handling Precautions:  Minimize dust generation and accumulation on surfaces.  Routine housekeeping should 
be instituted to ensure that dust does not accumulate on surfaces.  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal 
Protection”.  Avoid contact with incompatible materials (see Section 10, “Stability and Reactivity”). 

Storage:  Store and handling in accordance with all current regulations and standards. 

8. EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

Exposure Limits:  No occupational exposure limits have been established for bauxite.  This material is a particulate 
matter and adequate inhalation/respiratory protection should be used to minimize exposure.  The exposure limits for 
Particulates Not Otherwise Regulated (PNOR) are applicable. 

OSHA (PEL):  15 mg/m3 (TWA, total dust) 
 

5 mg/m3 (TWA, respirable fraction) 

NIOSH (REL):  10 mg/m3 (TWA, total particulates) 
 

5 mg/m3 (TWA, respirable particulates) 

 

Engineering  Controls:    Provide  local  exhaust  or  process  enclosure  ventilation  system.    Ensure  compliance  with 
applicable exposure limits.

Personal Protection:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal Protective 
Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material. 

Respiratory Protection:  If workplace conditions warrant a respirator, a respiratory protection program that meets 
OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.  Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators. 

Eye/Face Protection:  Wear splash resistant safety goggles with a face shield.  An eye wash station should be 
readily available near areas of use. 

Skin and Body Protection:  Personal protective equipment for the body should be selected based on the task 
being  performed  and  the  risks  involved  and  should  be  approved  by  a  specialist  before  handling  this  product.  
Chemical-resistant gloves should be worn at all times when handling chemicals.
