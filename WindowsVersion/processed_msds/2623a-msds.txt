	Recommended Use of This Material and Restrictions of Use

This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is a primary gas mixture of carbon dioxide in nitrogen supplied in a DOT 3AL specification aluminum (6061 alloy) cylinder with a water volume of 6 L.  This SRM is intended for the calibration of instruments used for carbon dioxide determinations and for other applications.  Mixtures are shipped with a nominal pressure exceeding 12.4 MPa (1800 psig), which provides the user with 0.73 m3 (25.8 ft3) of useable mixture.  The cylinder is the property of the purchaser and is equipped with a CGA-580 brass valve, which is the recommended outlet for this carbon dioxide mixture.

4. FIRST AID MEASURES

Description of First Aid Measures: 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration or oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention.

Skin Contact:  Wash skin with soap and water for at least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing and shoes.  Get medical attention, if needed.

Eye Contact:  Immediately flush eyes, including under the eyelids with copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes.  Seek immediate medical attention.

Ingestion:  Ingestion of a gas is unlikely.  As this product is a gas, refer to the inhalation section.

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  Harmful if inhaled, blood damage, difficulty breathing, and suffocation.

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention.  

5. FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Negligible fire hazard applicable to the identified NIST cylinder.  Cylinders may rupture or explode if exposed to heat.  See Section 9, “Physical and Chemical Properties” for flammability properties.

Extinguishing Media:

		Suitable:  Use extinguishing media appropriate to the surrounding fire.

		Unsuitable:  None listed.

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  Oxides of nitrogen, oxides of carbon.

Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Move cylinder from fire area if it can be done without personal risk.  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion byproducts.  Wear full protective clothing and NIOSH approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA).

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe)	

				Health = 2	Fire = 0	Reactivity = 0

6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Immediately contact emergency personnel.  Keep unnecessary personnel away.  Use suitable protective equipment; see Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.  Shut off gas supply if this can be done safely.  Isolate area until gas has dispersed. 

Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Stop leak if possible without personal risk.  Isolate hazard area and deny entry.  Stay upwind and keep out of low areas.

7. HANDLING AND STORAGE

Safe Handling Precautions:  Use only with adequate ventilation.  Do not puncture or incinerate container.  Close valve after each use and when empty.  Keep valve protection cap on cylinder when not in use.  

Storage:  Store and handle in accordance with all current regulations and standards.  Secure cylinder to prevent physical damage.  Keep separated from incompatible substances (oxidizing materials, halogens, metal oxides, metals, combustible materials, lithium).  Store in wellventilated area.  Subject to storage regulations, OSHA 29 CFR 1910.101.

Ingestion

Symptoms Related to the Physical, Chemical and Toxicological Characteristics:  Nausea, vomiting, chest pain, difficulty breathing, irregular heartbeat, headache, disorientation, emotional disturbances, pain in extremities, tremors, loss of coordination, hearing loss, visual disturbances.

Potential Health Effects (Acute, Chronic and Delayed):

Inhalation:  

Carbon Dioxide:  Acute exposure to carbon dioxide at concentrations of 2 % to 10 %, (NIST provided cylinder is 2.5 %), may cause acidic taste, dyspnea, headache, vertigo, nausea, labored breathing, weakness, drowsiness, mental confusion, and increase in blood pressure.  At higher concentrations, visual disturbances, tinnitus, tremors, perspiration, restlessness, discomfort, convulsions, loss of consciousness, coma, and death.  In addition, carbon dioxide/nitrogen compressed gas mixture is an asphyxiant.  Release in an enclosed space may result in asphyxiation.  The symptoms of asphyxia depend on the rapidity with which the oxygen deficiency develops and how long it continues.  In sudden acute asphyxia, unconsciousness may be immediate.  With slow development, there may be rapid respiration and pulse, air hunger, dizziness, reduced awareness, tightness in the head, tingling sensations, incoordination, faulty judgment, emotional instability, and rapid fatigue.  As the asphyxia progresses, nausea, vomiting, collapse, unconsciousness, convulsions, deep coma, and death are possible.

Nitrogen:  Nitrogen compressed gas is a simple asphyxiant.  Release in an enclosed space may result in asphyxiation.  The symptoms of asphyxia depend on the rapidity with which the oxygen deficiency develops and how long it continues.  In sudden acute asphyxia, unconsciousness may be immediate.  With slow development, there may be rapid respiration and pulse, air hunger, dizziness, reduced awareness, tightness in the head, tingling sensations, incoordination, faulty judgment, emotional instability, and rapid fatigue.  As the asphyxia progresses, nausea, vomiting, collapse, unconsciousness, convulsions, deep coma, and death are possible. 

Skin Contact:  No information on significant adverse effects.

Eye Contact:  Carbon dioxide at high concentration in air may cause a stinging sensation of the eyes.  Not applicable for exposure to nitrogen.

Ingestion:  Ingestion of a gas is unlikely under normal conditions of use (see “Inhalation”).
