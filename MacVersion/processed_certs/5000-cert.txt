This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is a 200 mm 
targets.  SRM 5000 is intended primarily for calibrating optical microscopes used to make overlay (OL) 
measurements.  It is also useful in calibrating other types of instruments capable of making overlay measurements, 
such as scanning electron microscopes or atomic force microscopes, provided that they have an appropriate level  of 
magnification and have the proper sample-holding capabilities.  
 
SRM 5000 consists of a grid  of 93 rectangular dies, each die measuring 17 .6 mm in the X-direction and 16.0 mm in 
 (Die 00-00) 
the Y-direction.  Figure 1 shows a progressively exploded view of the SRM 5000.  The center die
contains the calibrated Frame-in-Frame ( FF) and Bar-in-Bar (RR) targets.  Each die is divided into four quadrants: 
QI, QII, QIII, and QIV.  QIII is further divided into 4 sub-quadrants: SQ1, SQ2, SQ3, and SQ4.  SQ3 contains the 
relevant FF targets and SQ4 contains the relevant RR targets.  Each sub-quadrant contains rows o
f overlay targets 
with different dimensions and offsets.  Every two rows constitute a cell and there are 10 cells each in sub-quadrants 
  Ten targets in all were selected to calibrate; five FF 
3 and 4.  Figure 2 illustrates the labeling and layout of a cell.
targets from cell #8 and five RR targets  from cell #9.  The selected OL targets  are listed in Table 1.  A copy of the 
SP 260-165 [1], containing a detailed description of the SRM 5000 calibration process, is included with each unit for 
further reference. 
 
Each wafer was measured at least five times on severa
measurement system.  A measurement of a given target wi thin the total measurement sequence of a wafer consisted 
of individual auto-center and auto-focus operations, repeated three times at 0 ° and 180° orientations each, for a total 
of six independent dynamic measurements of a target on any given day and a complete measurement total of at least 
thirty measurements on that targ et.  The difference between the 0 ° and 180 ° measurements gives the Tool Induced 
Shift (TIS), which was continuously monitored as an indication of a properly aligned tool.  The a
verage of the 0 ° 
and 180° measurements gives the TIS Corrected Mean (TCM).  The average TCM is the result that is reported as the 
calibrated value. 
 
Certification Technique:   All measurements for certification were  made on the NIST Overlay Metrology Tool 
(OMT).  The performance of the NIST  OMT system was assessed by monitori ng the measurements of a control 
wafer throughout the calibration of each SRM 5000 wafer.   The NIST OMT is a full-fiel d Charge-coupled Device 
(CCD) based OL metrology optical microscope.  OL is determined by analyzing images acquired by the NI ST OMT 
with a set of OL algorithms developed at NIST. 
 
Expiration of Certification:   The certification of the SRM 5000 is va
uncertainty specified, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given in this 
certificate (see “Instructions for Care and Cleaning”).  Periodic recertification is not required; however, this 
certification will be nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, or modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:
substantive technical changes occur that  affect the certification before the expi ration of this certificate, NIST will 
notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
The overall direction and coordination of this work was managed by M. Stocker and R. Silver
Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory.

The responsibility for the development of the OMT was made  by E. Kornegay, formerly of the NIST Manufacturing 
Engineering Laboratory, and R. Attota, an independent consultant to the NIST Manufacturin
g Engineering 
Laboratory.  
 
Algorithms for determining and reporting the overlay registration values were programmed by J.
MEL and an independent set of OL algorithms were developed by R. Attota to confirm various aspects of our 
uncertainty budget.   
 
The statistical analysis was performed by N-F. Zhang of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division.   
 
The support aspects involved in the issuance of this SRM were coordinated through the Measurement Services 
Division. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 
 
Instructions for Care and Cleaning:   Care must be exercised when handling and storing the SRM.  The process 
stack for this SRM wafer is double-etched silicon.  Nothing must come in contact with the surface of the wafer.  The 
wafer must be stored in a clean stab
cleanroom.  Any contamin ation on the wafer within the optical proximity of the calibrated targets, typically on the 
order of 5 µm for these targets, will render the calibration void.
    This wafer is not intended to be separated into 
individual dies; doing so will void the calibration.   
 

le environment, preferably inside a  wafer shell in a Class 100 or better 

Calibration Traceability:  Traceability to the meter was established 
Magnification Standard on the OMT.  The measurement of this SRM 2800 allows for the determination of the 
effective scale calibration for the combination of the microscope and CCD.  This  scale factor is the means by which 
pixels are converted to nanometers in the OL measurements. 
 
Certified Measurements and Uncertainties:   The final measured values and th eir corresponding uncertainties are 
listed in the table below.  All uncertainties are calcula
