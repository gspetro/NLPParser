Certificate of Analysis 
 
Standard Reference Material 3262 
 
St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum L.) Aerial  Parts 
 
This  Standard  Reference  Material  (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  use  in  validating  analytical  methods  for  the 
determination  of chlorogenic acid,  flavonoids, naphthodianthrones, and toxic elements in  Hypericum perforatum L. 
and  similar  materials.    This  SRM  can  be  used for  quality  assurance when  assigning values  to  in-house  control 
materials.    This  SRM  has also been  characterized  for  its  DNA  sequence.   A  unit  of  SRM 3262  consists of  five 
heat-sealed aluminized  pouches, each containing approximately  3.3  g of material. 
 
The  development  of  SRM 3262  was  through  collaboration  among  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and 
Technology (NIST);  the National  Institutes of Health Office  of Dietary  Supplements (NIH-ODS);  and the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA)  Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER).   The addition of genetic informatio n  
was  accomplished  through  collaboration  among  NIST,  NIH-ODS,  the  U.S.  Department  of  Agriculture (USDA ) 
Agricultural  Research  Service (ARS),  AuthenTechnologies (Richmond,  CA),  and American  Herbal  Pharmacopoeia 
(Scotts Valley,  CA). 
 
Taxonomic  Identification:   The taxonomic  identity is Hypericum perforatum L.  established through identification 
by a trained botanist using an herbarium specimen from  original material  and from  associated DNA sequence analysis 
from  botanically authenticated Hypericum perforatum L.  The associated DNA sequences are available in companion 
FASTA-formatted  files [1].    The  uncertainty  associated with  each  nucleotide  in  the  sequence,  and  in  turn  the 
uncertainty  associated with  the  DNA  sequence as  an  identifier  of  species, is  expressed  in  an  ordinal  scale  that 
represents the confidence estimates of the assigned value (Tables 1 and 2) [2].   These DNA  sequences are used as a 
source of identity data for Hypericum perforatum L.   
 
Certified  Mass  Fraction  Values:   Certified  mass  fraction  values for  toxic  elements  in  SRM 3262,  reported on a 
dry-mass basis, are provided in Table 3.  A NIST  certified  value is a value for which NIST  has the highest confidence 
in its accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [3].  Analyses 
for value assignment were performed by NIST.   Certified  values were calculated as the mean of the mean values fro m 
NIST  methods.  The associated uncertainties are expressed at an approximately  95 % level of confidence [4–6]. 
 
Reference  Mass  Fraction  Values:   Reference  mass fraction  values, reported on a dry-mass basis, are provided for 
chlorogenic  acid,  flavonoids, and  naphthodianthrones (Table 4)  and  lead  (Table 5).    A  NIST  reference  value  is  a 
noncertified value that is the best estimate of the true value based on available  data; however, the value does not meet 
the NIST  criteria  for certification  [3] and is provided with associated uncertainties that may reflect only measurement  
reproducibility,  may  not include  all  sources of uncertainty, or  may  reflect  a lack  of sufficient  statistical agreement 
among multiple  analytical  methods.  The reference mass fraction values were derived from  results reported by NIST. 
 
Expiration  of Certification:   The certification  of SRM  3262 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until  01 March  2026,  provided the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored in  accordance with  the  instructions given  in  this 
certificate (see “Instructions for Storage and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, 
or otherwise modified 
 
Coordination of the technical measurements leading to the certification of this SRM was performed  by C.A. Rimmer, 
L.J.  Wood of the NIST  Chemical  Sciences Division,  and K.E.  Sharpless formerly  of  the NIST  Chemical  Sciences 
Division.

Maintenance  of  SRM Certification:   NIST  will  monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.   If substantive 
technical  changes occur  that affect  the certification  before  the  expiration  of  this certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will  facilitate  notification. 
 
Support for  the development of SRM  3262  was provided in  part by the NIH-ODS  and the FDA CDER.   Technical 
consultation  from 
Acquisition and preparation of the material  were  coordinated by A. NguyenPho and K.E.  Sharpless. 
 
Analytical  measurements  at  NIST  were  performed  by  B.L.  Catron,  K.D.  Chieh,  P.B.  Howell,  S.E.  Long, 
K.E.  Murphy,  M.A. Nelson,  R.L.  Paul,  M.M. Phillips,  and  L.J.  Wood  of  the  NIST  Chemical  Sciences  Division.   
Molecular  approach for  species identity was coordinated and performed  by D.H.  Reynaud of  AuthenTechnologies, 
with  two  collaborating  laboratories  for  sequencing analyses: University  of  California  Berkeley  DNA  Sequencing 
Facility (Berkeley,  CA) and Sequetech, Inc. (Mountain View,  CA).  Technical consultation was provided by J.M. Betz 
(NIH-ODS),  J. Harnly  (USDA-ARS),  R.  Upton (American  Herbal  Pharmacopoeia),  and W. Applequist (Missouri 
Botanical Garden,  St. Louis, MO).   
 
Statistical analysis was provided by J.H.  Yen of the NIST  Statistical Engineering  Division. 
 
Support  aspects involved  in  the  issuance of  this  SRM  were  coordinated through the  NIST  Office  of  Reference 
Materials. 
 
NOTICE  TO USERS:   SRM 3262  IS INTENDED  FOR  RESEARCH  USE,  NOT FOR  HUMAN  CONSUMPTION. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS  FOR  STORAGE  AND  USE 
 
Storage:  The SRM should be stored at controlled room temperature (20  °C to 25  °C), in its original  unopened packets, 
until required for use.  For elemental  analyses, the packet can be resealed and test portions removed and analyzed until 
the material  reaches its expiration  date.  For chlorogenic acid, flavonoids, and naphthodianthrones analysis, the packet 
can be resealed and test portions removed and analyzed for up to two months after opening. 
 
Use:  Prior to use, the contents of the packet should be mixed  thoroughly.  Allow  the contents to settle for one minute 
prior to opening to minimize  the loss of fine particles.  To relate analytical determinations to the certified or reference 
values in  this  Certificate  of  Analysis, the  minimum  test portion  mass  indicated  in  the “Source,  Preparation,  and 
Analysis” section for each group of analytes below should be used.  Results obtained in analyses should include their 
own estimates of uncertainty and can be compared to the certified  or reference  values using procedures described in 
reference [7].   The moisture conversion factor can be used for the sample(s)  when using an unopened packet for the 
first time.   If using a previously opened and resealed packet, sample(s) need to be dried using one of the recommended 
techniques (see “Determination  of Moisture”). 
 
Determination  of Moisture:   Moisture content of SRM 3262  was determined at NIST  by (1) drying over magnesium 
perchlorate  in  a  desiccator  at  room  temperature  for  14  d  and (2)  drying  for  2 h  in  a  forced-air  oven  at  70  °C.   
Unweighted  results  obtained  using  both  techniques  were  averaged  to  determine  a  conversion  factor  of 
(0.9512  ± 0.0022)  gram  dry-mass per gram  as-received mass, which  was used to convert data from  an as-received to 
a dry-mass basis; the uncertainty shown on this value is an expanded uncertainty (coverage factor k = 2).   A relative 
uncertainty component for the conversion factor (0.11  %) obtained from  the moisture measurements is incorporated 
in  the uncertainties  of  the  certified  and  reference  values,  reported on  a  dry-mass  basis,  that are  provided in  this 
certificate. 
 
SOURCE,  PREPARATION,  AND  ANALYSIS( 1) 
 
Source and  Preparation:   The SRM is a cultivated, dried plant material  of St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum L.) 
purchased from a commercial  source.  The material  was received as whole stalks; the leaves and petioles were stripped 
off,  ground  in  a  blender,  and  sieved  to  180  µm  (80  mesh).    The  material  was  shipped to  High-Purity  Standards 
(Charleston, SC)  where  it  was blended, aliquoted,  and heat-sealed inside nitrogen-flushed 4 mil  polyethylene bags, 
which  were  then sealed inside  nitrogen-flushed aluminized  plastic bags along with  two packets of  silica  gel  each.  
After packaging, the material  was irradiated  (Neutron Products, Inc., Dickerson, MD) by 60Co to an absorbed dose of 
27.5  kGy  to 33.5  kGy. 

                                                                 

(1) Certain  commercial  equipment,  instruments or  materials  are  identified  in  this certificate  to adequately  specify the 
ds
experimental procedure. Such identification does not imply recommendation or endorsement by the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available  for the purpose.

Analytical  Approach  for  Determination  of  Chlorogenic  Acid,  Flavonoi ds,  and  Naphthodianthrones:    Valu e 
assignment of the mass fractions of chlorogenic acid, flavonoids, and naphthodianthrones in SRM 3262  was based on 
measurements provided by NIST  using liquid  chromatography (LC)  with absorbance and/or fluorescence detection. 
 
NIST  Analyses  for  Chlorogenic Acid,  Rutin, Hyperoside,  Quercitrin,  Hypericin, and Pseudohypericin:   The  mass 
fractions of chlorogenic acid,  rutin,  hyperoside, quercitrin,  hypericin,  and pseudohypericin were determined  by LC 
with  absorbance and/or fluorescence detection from  duplicate, nominal  1.0  g test portions taken from  10  packets of 
SRM  3262.   Test portions were  combined  with  a measured  mass of internal  standard solution (rhodamine  6G),  1 g 
hydromatrix,  and methanol, placed in a Pyrex  Soxhlet extraction thimble  and allowed to reflux  for 24  h before analysis 
by LC.   A C18  column  and a  gradient method with  a  mobile  phase consisting of  (A) aqueous 0.5  % triethylamin e 
(volume  fractions)  adjusted to pH 4.5  with  acetic  acid  and (B)  acetonitrile  were  used.  Absorbance at 340  nm  was 
monitored  for  detection  of  chlorogenic  acid,  rutin,  hyperoside,  and  quercitrin,  and  absorbance  at  590  nm  was 
monitored  for  detection  of  hypericin  and  pseudohypericin  using  a  photodiode  array  detector.    Hypericin  and 
pseudohypericin were  also  monitored  by  fluorescence  at  an  excitation  wavelength  of  470  nm  and  an  emission 
wavelength of 590  nm.  Additional method details and a typical chromatogram are provided in Appendix E.  Calibrants  
were prepared gravimetrically  at levels intended to approximate  levels of the analytes in the extracts of the SRM.   The 
purity  of neat calibrant  materials  for  chlorogenic  acid,  hyperoside, quercitrin,  hypericin,  and pseudohypericin was 
determined at NIST  by quantitative proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (qNMR). The purity of the neat 
calibrant  material  for  rutin  was determined  at NIST  by LC  with  absorbance detection.   A single  internal  standard 
solution was used for calibrants and samples. 
 
Analytical  Approach  for  Determination  of  Elements:   Value  assignment of the mass fractions of the elements in 
SRM  3262  was  based on measurements  provided by  NIST  using isotope dilution/cold  vapor  inductively  coupled 
plasma  mass  spectrometry (ID/CV  ICP-MS), 
isotope 
dilution  inductively  coupled  plasma  mass  spectrometry (ID  ICP-MS),  and  instrumental  neutron  activation 
analysis (INAA).   
 
NIST Analyses for As by INAA:   The mass fraction of arsenic was determined by INAA from  duplicate, nominal  0.3  g 
test portions taken from  ten packets of SRM  3262.   Test portions were packaged individually  in clean polyethylene 
bags along with gravimetric  standards made from SRM  3103a,  lot #100818,  Arsenic (As) Standard Solution and were 
distributed among  four  irradiation  vessels.  Each  vessel was irradiated  for  2 h  at 20 MW and rotated end-over-end 
after 1 h to ensure a uniform  neutron flux.   Test portions were allowed  to decay 5 d to 6 d after which  test portions 
were counted for 5 h.  The 559  keV  line  from  decay of 76As was used for quantification. 
 
NIST Analyses for As by ICP-MS:   The mass fraction of arsenic was determined  by ICP-MS  from  duplicate, nominal 
itric  acid 
0.5  g test portions taken from  six  packages of SRM 3262.   Samples  were digested in closed vessels using nitric  acid 
ns
in  a  microwave  sample  preparation system.    Quantification  was  based on  the method  of  standard additions using 
spectrometric single element  standard solution SRM 3103a,  lot #100818. 
 
NIST Analyses for Cd and Pb by ID ICP-MS:   Mass fractions of cadmium  and lead in SRM  3262  were determined by 
ID ICP-MS  from  duplicate,  nominal  0.7  g  test  portions taken  from  each  of  six  (Pb)  to  twelve  (Cd)  packets  of 
SRM  3262.   Samples  were spiked with  isotopically enriched 206Pb and 111Cd and were digested in nitric  acid using a 
microwave  sample  preparation system.   Digests were  transferred to plastic bottles and diluted with  the appropriate 
volume  of 2 %  (volume  fraction)  nitric  acid.   Lead  was measured by ICP-MS  in standard mode,  whereas cadmiu m 
was  measured  in  collision  cell/kinetic  energy  discrimination  mode.    The  use  of  ID ICP-MS  for  the  accurate 
measurement  of Cd has been described in detail [8].   Cadmium  standards were prepared from  SRM  3108  Cadmiu m 
Standard Solution  and high  purity  Cd  metal  (99.999+  percent purity)  whose source is  SRM 746  Cadmium-Vap o r 
Pressure.  Lead standards were prepared from  SRM  3128  Lead (Pb) Standard Solution, and from  high purity Pb metal 
(99.999  percent purity)  obtained from  Johnson Matthey (London, UK).    The standards were  used to calibrate  the 
amount of added 111Cd and 206Pb via reverse ID  ICP-MS  [8].   
 
NIST  Analyses  for  Hg  by  ID/CV  ICP-MS:    The  mass  fraction  of  mercury  in  SRM 3262  was  determined  by 
ID/CV  ICP-MS  from  single,  nominal  0.2  g test portions taken  from  each of eight  packets of  SRM 3262.   Samples  
were  spiked with  isotopically  enriched 201Hg and were  digested in  a  nitric  acid/hydrochloric  acid  mixture  using a 
microwave  sample  preparation  system.    Quantification  was  based  on  the  method  of  isotope  dilution  analysis 
monitoring  the 201Hg/202Hg isotope ratios [9].

ASSIGNMENT  OF  IDENTITY 
 
Molecular Approach for Species Identity:  Sanger sequencing was used on three independent chloroplast gene regions, 
trnL-trnF intergenic region [10,11],  rbcL intron [12],  and the nuclear ribosomal gene internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 
sequence for authentication of SRM 3262.   Complete  sequencing of the strands of DNA  for  the three gene regions 
was performed  on triplicate  samples, the sequence reads were independently hand-curated, and the confidence values 
were  estimated  as described below.    DNA  sequences are  available  in  companion  FASTA-formatted  files  [1].   To 
certify the species identity, validation studies were performed based on the “Probability of Identification (POI)”  model 
using an Inclusivity  and Exclusivity  Panel [13].    Multiple  samples of  authenticated herbarium  vouchers, botanical 
identity reference materials,  and published literature were used to comprise the panels from  the target and most closely 
related  species (see Appendix  A for  more  information  on the reference  samples).   These samples were  analyzed a 
minimum  of  ten times  to  ensure consistency in  methods from  replicate  to  replicate.    Maximum  Likelihood  (ML) 
phylogenetic  analyses were  performed  using  the  phylogenetic  estimation  using  ML  (PhyML)  algorithm,  with  a 
General  Time  Reversible  (GTR)  substitution  model,  a  fixed  transition-transversion  ratio,  and  1,000  bootstrap 
replicates.  ML phylogenies, and the DNA aligned matrices, which can be found in Appendices B, C and D, were used 
to determine  the species identity of SRM 3262  and to estimate the confidence (as described below).   The confidence 
levels for both the trnL-trnF intergenic region, the rbcL intron, and the ITS sequence were “Most Confident” (0). 
 
The taxonomic  identification  is Hypericum  perforatum L.  and the associated chloroplast DNA  sequences from  the 
trnL-trnF intergenic spacer and rbcL intron regions and from  the nuclear ribosomal  gene internal transcribed spacer 
(ITS)  sequence are  available  in  companion  FASTA-formatted  files [1].    The  confidence  associated  with  each 
nucleotide in the sequence, and in turn the confidence associated with the DNA  sequence as an identifier  of species, 
is expressed in an ordinal  scale that represents the strength of the belief  in the assigned value (Table 1) [2].   In the 
absence of a fully  developed metrology  for identity,  these DNA sequences are used as a source of  identity data for 
Hypericum  perforatum L.    Chloroplast  and  nuclear  ribosomal  DNA  sequences from  botanically  authenticated 
Hypericum perforatum L. samples are used to establish inclusivity; chloroplast and nuclear ribosomal  DNA sequences 
from  close relatives are used to establish exclusivity. 
 
Nucleotide Identity:    A  set of  heuristic,  experience-based,  rules  (see  Table 2)  were  used to  establish confidence 
estimates for the nucleotides comprising  the DNA  sequences obtained from SRM 3262,  and their use in identifying 
the  species  (see  Table  1).    The  DNA  sequences with  curated  confidence  estimates  are  available  in  companion 
FASTA-formatted  files [1].   The DNA  aligned matrices  used to determine  the species identity and their  confidence 
estimates are  provided in Appendices B, C,  and D.   The confidence associated with each nucleotide in the sequence 
in  the FASTA files  provided [1],  and in  turn the confidence associated with  the DNA  sequence as an identifier  of 
species, is expressed in an ordinal scale that represents the strength of the belief in the assigned value (Table 2) [2].  
Characteristics  of  sequence data and  phylogenetic data used for  species identity  associated with  the levels  of  the 
ordinal  scale are  described in  Tables 1  and 2.    The confidence estimates  for  the trnL-trnF  intergenic  spacer, rbcL 
intron region, and ITS sequences are available in companion FASTA-formatted  files [1].

No  clear  mutually  supporting results; unambiguous base calls  disagree; or  no 
unambiguous base calls  on either  strand; data from  the two  opposing strands 
could not be authoritatively reconciled. 

 
Homogeneity  Assessment:  The homogeneity of chlorogenic acid, flavonoids, naphthodianthrones, and elements was 
assessed at NIST using the methods and test portion sizes described above.  Based on statistical analysis of analytical 
results from  NIST,  and allowing  for potential uncertainty for material  heterogeneity, the uncertainty for cadmium  and 
lead incorporate an additional  component for possible heterogeneity.  The homogeneity of the DNA  sequences was 
evaluated by sequencing the DNA from  multiple  samples from  three randomly-selected packets, revealing the degree 
of homogeneity in DNA sequence or species identity.  The DNA data were homogeneous. 
 
NIST  strives to maintain  the SRM  inventory supply, but NIST  cannot guarantee the continued or continuous supply 
of any specific SRM.   Accordingly, NIST  encourages the use of this SRM as a primary  benchmark  for the quality and 
accuracy of  the user’s in-house reference  materials  and working  standards.  As such, the SRM  should be  used to 
validate the more  routinely used reference  materials  in  a laboratory.  Comparisons  between the SRM  and in-house 
reference materials  or working  measurement  standards should take place at intervals appropriate to the conservation 
of  the  SRM  and  the stability  of  relevant  in-house materials.    For  further  guidance  on how  this  approach can  be 
implemented,  contact NIST  by email  at srms@nist.gov. 
 
Certified  Mass Fraction  Values for Selected Elements:   Each certified  mass fraction value, reported on a dry-mass 
basis, is the combined mean  from  the means of results from  analyses provided by NIST.   The uncertainty provided 
with  each  value  is  an  expanded  uncertainty  about  the  mean  to  cover  the  measurand  with  approximately  95 % 
confidence.  The expanded uncertainty is calculated as U = kuc, where uc incorporates the observed difference between 
the results from  the methods and their  respective uncertainties  consistent  with  the  ISO/JCGM  Guide  and with  its 
Supplement 1, and k is a coverage factor corresponding to approximately  95 % confidence [4–6].   The uncertainty for 
Cd  incorporates an uncertainty component for possible heterogeneity.  The measurand is the total mass fraction for 
each element in St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum L.) Aerial  Parts as listed in Table 3.  Metrological traceability  
is to the SI derived unit for mass fraction (expressed as milligrams  per kilogram)  on a dry-mass basis.

Reference  Mass  Fraction  Values for  Chlorogenic  Acid,  Flavonoi ds,  and  Naphthodianthrones:   Each  reference 
mass fraction value, reported on a dry-mass basis, is the mean  of results from  NIST  analyses by LC  with absorbance 
and/or fluorescence detection.  The uncertainty provided with  each value is an expanded uncertainty about the mean  
to cover the measurand  with  approximately  95  % confidence.    The expanded  uncertainty is calculated  as U = kuc, 
where  uc  represents the  combined  uncertainty  consistent with  the  ISO/JCGM  Guide  and  k  is  a  coverage  factor

Figure 1.  trnL-trnF DNA Aligned Matrix  for Hypericum perforatum L. and Relatives.  The results from the chloroplast 
region demonstrates that this region does distinguish this species from its relatives and does authenticate Hypericum 
perforatum L.  The individual bases are represented as A = Adenine, T = Thymine,  G  =  Guanine,  C=  Cystosine, and 
U = Uracil.   Polymorphic  bases are represented by standard IUPAC codes with R = A/G,  W = A/T, M = A/c, Y  = C/T, 
S  =  G/C,  K  =  G/T,  and N  =  missing  data.  The confidence estimate  for  the species identification  of  SRM 3262  as 
Hypericum perforatum L. is Most Confident (0).

Figure  2.   rbcL  DNA  Aligned Matrix  for Hypericum  perforatum L. and Relatives.  The results from  the chloroplast 
region demonstrates that this region does distinguish this species from its relatives and does authenticate Hypericum 
perforatum L.  The four bases of DNA are represented as A = Adenine, T = Thymine, G  = Guanine, and C  = Cytosine.  
Polymorphic  bases are represented by standard IUPAC  codes with R = A/G,  W = A/T, M = A/c, Y  = C/T,  S = G/C, 
K = G/T,  and N = missing data.  The confidence estimate  for the species identification of  SRM 3262  as Hypericum 
perforatum L. is Most Confident (0).
