Reference Material 8366 
 
EGFR and MET Gene Copy Number Standards for Cancer Measurements 

 
 
Reference Material (RM) 8366 is intended to harmonize the measurements of ratios of the human epidermal growth 
factor gene (EGFR) and human MET proto-oncogene, receptor tyrosine kinase gene (MET) to unamplified reference 
genes.  EGFR gene amplification and the associated increased protein expression have been reported and implicated 
in the pathogenesis of many human malignancies.  The amplification (increased copies) of the EGFR gene and protein 
overexpression  in  several  types  of  cancer  are  used  as  a  biomarker  for  determining  the  therapeutic  treatment  and 
predicting  clinical  outcome  in  response  to  anti-EGFR  targeted  therapy [1].    MET  gene  amplification  resulting  in 
increased protein expression and constitutive activation of the MET receptor has been described in lung cancer, gastric 
carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma.  Various clinical trials were conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
selective MET inhibitors in cancer patients.  However, the accurate and reliable assessment of MET levels is still a 
challenge [2].  RM 8366 consists of genomic DNA extracted from six human cancer cell lines with different amounts 
of amplification of the EGFR and MET genes.  The six purified genomic DNAs are in a buffer consisting of 10 mmol/L 
2-Amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)  propane-1,3-diol (Tris)  and  0.1 mmol/L  ethylenediaminetetraacetic  acid  disodium 
salt (EDTA) pH 8.0 (TE-4).  The six components are genomic DNA materials derived from human cell lines A-431, 
BT-20,  C32,  Daoy,  Hs  746T,  and  SNU-5,  and  labeled  A,  B,  C,  D,  E,  and  F,  respectively.    The  approximate 
concentration of components A, B, C, D, E, and F determined by absorbance measurements at 260 nm are 21.6 µg/mL, 
21.7 µg/mL, 21.5 µg/mL, 22.9 µg/mL, 23.1 µg/mL, and 21.0 µg/mL, respectively.  It is important to consider that the 
levels of EGFR and MET amplification in the individual components when preparing the dilutions to ensure that the 
EGFR and MET copy number is within the working range of the assay that you are using.  A unit of the RM consists 
of one vial of each component, containing approximately 100 μL of DNA solution.  Each of these vials is labeled and 
is sealed with a color-coded screw cap. 
 
Reference Values:  Reference ratios of EGFR and MET copies per reference genes with the 95 % credible intervals 
and 95 % prediction intervals are shown in Tables 1 and 2.  A NIST reference value is a best estimate of the true value 
provided on a NIST certificate, certificate of analysis, or report of investigation where all known or suspected sources 
of bias have not been fully investigated by NIST [3]. 
 
Information Values:  Information values for EGFR, MET, and Reference Genes Copies per microliter are shown in 
Table 3.    An  information  value  is  considered  to  be  a  value  that  will  be  of  interest  and  use  to  the  RM  user,  but 
insufficient information is available to assess the uncertainty associated with the value or only a limited number of 
analyses were performed [3].  Information values cannot be used to establish metrological traceability.   
 
Expiration  of  Value  Assignment:    The  reference  and  informational  values  of  RM 8366  are  valid  within  the 
measurement uncertainty specified, until 31 December 2022, provided the RM is handled and stored in accordance 
with  the  instructions  given  in  this  report  (see  “Instructions  for  Handling,  Storage,  and  Use”).    This  material  and 
associated information are nullified if the RM is damaged, contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of RM:  NIST will monitor this RM over the period of its validity.  If substantive technical changes 
occur that affect the value assignment before the expiration of this report, NIST will notify the purchaser.  Registration 
(see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification.

NOTICE AND WARNING TO USERS 
 
RM 8366 IS A HUMAN-SOURCE MATERIAL.  SINCE THERE IS NO CONSENSUS ON THE INFECTIOUS 
STATUS  OF  EXTRACTED  DNA,  HANDLE  THE  RM 8366  COMPONENTS  AS  BIOSAFETY  LEVEL 1 
MATERIALS CAPABLE OF TRANSMITTING INFECTIOUS DISEASE [4].  RM 8366 components and derived 
solutions should be disposed of in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE AND USE 
 
Storage:  All vials of RM 8366 should be stored in the dark between 2 °C to 8 °C.  DO NOT FREEZE. 
 
Use:   Component  vials should be  mixed briefly and centrifuged (without opening the vial cap) prior to removing 
sample  aliquots  for  analysis.    For  the  reference  and  informational  values  to  be  applicable,  materials  should  be 
withdrawn  immediately after  opening  the  vials and processed  without delay.   Dilutions  of these  materials  may be 
made as appropriate, but the dilutions should be used immediately and not stored.  Reference and informational values 
do not apply to any material remaining in recapped vials.  There is no minimum sample size requirement, the amount 
required by any given assay will be dictated by the nature of the assay.  DO NOT EXPOSE ANY DNA SOLUTION 
TO DIRECT SUNLIGHT.  This reference material is suitable only for measurement techniques that utilize purified 
DNA. 
 
For use with digital PCR polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) Assays:  The provided reference ratios could be used 
for EGFR and MET ddPCR assay validation, optimization, and process evaluation, and measurements harmonization. 
Use  the  informational  value  of  EGFR  and  MET  and  reference  genes  copies  per  microliter  and  the  approximate 
concentration values when designing dilutions. 
 
Reference Values:  Tables 1 and 2 have reference values for the ratios of the EGFR and MET gene copies to the 
average copies of the indicated reference genes, the approximate 95 % credible intervals, and the approximate 95 % 
prediction intervals.  The measurand is the ratio of EGFR or MET copies to the average copy number of the listed 
reference genes.  Metrological traceability is to the natural unit ratio one [5].

The values in Tables 1 and 2 were calculated by fitting a statistical model to the measurements made on the RM 8366 
materials using a digital PCR method.  The Bayesian paradigm with vague priors was used for statistical inference [6]. 
The posterior credible interval is an interval calculated in a manner consistent with the ISO/JCGM Guide [7].  The 
nominal coverage for the interval is 95 % and can be interpreted in the following manner.  The NIST analysts believe 
that the ratio of gene copy number for either EGFR or MET and the average among the selected set of reference genes 
(as listed in the "Reference Genes Used for Analysis" column of Table 1 and Table 2) for a single bottle sampled from 
among those prepared for this RM lies within the respective provided interval with approximately 95 % probability.  
The  prediction  interval  provides  the  approximate  range  of  values  NIST  would  reasonably  expect  upon  the  next 
independent, triplicate measurement of the EGFR or MET copy number ratios to the average among the selected set 
of reference genes (as listed in the "Reference Genes Used for Analysis" column of Table 1 and Table 2) for each of 
the six components, based upon the measurement performance of NIST analysts and instruments.  The value would 
be expected to fall within the interval approximately 95 % of the time.

Homogeneity and Stability Studies:  Each of the components of RM 8366 was distributed into 550 tubes that were 
then  stored  at  4 °C  in  the  dark.    Homogeneity  studies  were  accomplished  by  selecting  10 vials  of  each  of  the 
components that were distributed throughout the order of dispensing.  These vials were analyzed by a dPCR method. 
Analysis of the data did not indicate any detectable changes in the values of any of the 6 components that varied with 
dispensing order (given the uncertainty of the measurements).  Stability testing was conducted on the samples that 
were stored at 4 °C in the dark for different periods of time.  The EGFR and MET copy number, and the ratio of EGFR 
and MET gene to the reference gene RPS27A and EIF5B were  measured by dPCR and the data did not show any 
significant changes in any of the 6 components (given the uncertainty of the measurements) for periods of time up to 
408 days, the last storage time analyzed. 
 
Sample Preparation:  NIST RM 8366 consists of genomic DNA samples prepared from six human cancer cell lines. 
After the initial extraction using the Zymo Quick-gDNA™ midiPrep kit (Zymo Research Corporation, Irvine, CA); 
the samples were pre-treated with bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A before re-extraction [8].  All purified genomic 
DNA samples were dissolved or eluted in TE-4 buffer (10 mmol/L Tris, 0.1 mmol/L EDTA, pH 8.0) and stored at 4 ºC. 
The  DNA  samples  from  the  cell  lines  were  genotyped  using  STR  analysis  and  the  results  agree  with  the  values 
provided by the cell line repository. 
 
dPCR Assays:  The qPCR assays for EGFR and MET and reference genes were developed according to the Minimum 
Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) guidelines [9].  The primers and 
probes for the EGFR and MET and reference genes for the qPCR assays are listed in Table 4.  The efficiency and 
specificity of the assays were also determined [10].  MIQE guidelines for dPCR were followed and included sample 
replicates,  positive  and  negative  controls,  and  proper  documentation [11].    TaqMan  probes  are  shown  in  Table 5.  
BHQ-1™ (Black hole quencher) and FAM labeled probes were obtained from Biosearch Technologies (Novato, CA). 
The TaqMan PCR reaction mixture consists of 1 × Droplet dPCR Supermix for probes (no dUTP) (Bio-Rad, Hercules, 
CA), 900 nmol/L primers, and 250 nmol/L probe (final concentrations) and genomic DNA template or non-template 
control in a total volume of 25 μL.  Approximately 20 ng of genomic DNA was applied in each reaction except for 
EGFR detection in RM 8366 Comp A and B, and MET detection in Comp E and F, where 4 ng of genomic DNA was 
applied.  Twenty microliters out of the 25 μL droplet dPCR reaction mixture was used for droplet generation and the

PCR reaction.  The PCR was performed on an Applied Biosystems ProFlex™ PCR System.  The following thermal 
cycling conditions were used:  95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s and 60 °C for 1 min, then 
98 °C for 10 min, temperature ramp rate at 2 °C/s.  After PCR, the 96-well PCR plate was loaded onto the QX200 
droplet  digital  reader  (Bio-Rad),  which  automatically  reads  the  droplets  from  each  well  of  the  plate.    The 
concentrations of DNA copies were calculated using Poisson sampling statistics assuming that the DNA molecules 
are partitioning independently from each other into the individual droplets.  The results were obtained from assays 
performed  by  two  analysts  using  a  Bio-Rad  QX200  droplet  digital  PCR  system;  the  Bio-Rad  QuantaSoft  Version 
1.7.4.0917 used a droplet size of 0.85 nL for determination of DNA copy concentrations. 
 
Informational Values:  The approximate concentration of components A, B, C, D, E, and F determined by absorbance 
measurements  at  260 nm  are  21.6 µg/mL,  21.7 µg/mL,  21.5 µg/mL,  22.9 µg/mL,  23.1 µg/mL,  and  21.0 µg/mL, 
respectively.  The absorbance at 260 nm of the components (six replicates) were measured and a conversion factor 
(one  optical  density  at  260 nm  with  a  pathlength  of  1 cm  is  50 µg DNA/mL)  was  used  for  the  calculation.    The 
approximate  values  were  used  to  determine  the  appropriate  dilution  of  the  samples  for  use  with  the  desired 
measurement technique.  It is important to consider the level of EGFR and MET amplification in the samples and 
appropriate dilutions may be needed to ensure that the EGFR and MET copy number are within the working range of 
the assay.   
 
Tables 3 contains the informational values for the concentrations (copies per microliters) of the EGFR and MET gene 
and the reference genes in the components of RM 8366, determined by dPCR.  This data is from a subset of the data 
used to calculate the reference ratios in Tables 1 and 2. The samples  were measured by dPCR using the reference 
genes indicated in the respective tables.
