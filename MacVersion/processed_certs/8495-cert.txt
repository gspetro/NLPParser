These  Reference  Materials  (RMs)  are  intended  primarily  for  use  in  fundamental  studies  on  the  properties  of 
fibers  and  paper  sheets.  The  RMs  provide  samples  so  that  investigators  in  different  laboratories  can  be  assured 
that  they  are  investigating  the  same  materials.  The  materials  selected  for  these  nwo  RMs  are  bleached  dried  Jap

RMs  8495  and  8496  were  developed  and  prepared  with  input  and  support  from  the  Pulp  Material  Research
