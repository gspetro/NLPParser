Standard Reference Material 2266 
 
-Trimethylpentane 
Hopanes and Steranes in 2,2,4-Trimethylpentane 
 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is a  solution of five  hopanes and five  steranes in 2,2,4-trimethylpentane 
(iso-octane).  This SRM is intended primarily for use in the calibration of chromatographic instrumentation used for 
the determination of hopanes and steranes.  A unit of SRM 2266 consists of five 2 mL ampoules, each containing 
approximately 1.2 mL of solution. 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values:  The certified mass fraction values and estimated uncertainties for three hopanes 
and four steranes are given in Table 1 along with the Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) Registry Numbers [1]. The 
certified concentration values are based on results obtained from the gravimetric preparation of this solution and from 
the analytical results determined by using gas chromatography.  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has 
the highest confidence in its accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken 
into account [2].  
 
Reference  Concentration  Values:    Reference  values,  also  expressed  as  mass  fractions,  for  two  additional 
hopanes and one additional sterane are provided in Table 2.  The reference values are noncertified values that do 
not  meet  NIST  criteria  for  certification  and  are  provided  with  associated  uncertainties  that  may  reflect  only 
measurement  precision,  may  not  include  all  sources  of  uncertainty,  or  may  reflect  a  lack  of  sufficient  statistical 
agreement among multiple methods.   
 
Expiration of Certification:   The certification of SRM 2266 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until  31 March 2026,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  given  in  this 
certificate (see “Instructions for Handling, Storage, and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, 
contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
$  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register) will facilitate notification. 
 
Partial funding support for the preparation and certification of this Standard Reference Material was provided by the 
U.S. Environmental Protection  Agency, Office of  Research and Development, Human Exposure and  Atmospheric 
Science Division, National Exposure Research Laboratory. 
 
Coordination  of  the  technical  measurements  leading  to  the  certification  of  this  SRM  was  under  the  direction  of 
Chemical  Sciences  Division 
M.M. Schantz and L.C. Sander of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division. 
 
Analytical measurements of the SRM were performed by M.M. Schantz of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division. 
 
Statistical consultation for this SRM was provided by S.D. Leigh of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division.

DLING,  STORANGE  AND

INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORANGE AND USE 
 
Handling: This material should be handled with care.  Use proper disposal methods. 
 
Storage:  Sealed ampoules, as received, should be stored in the dark at temperatures lower than 30 °C. 
 
Use:  Sample aliquots for analysis should be withdrawn at 20 °C to 25 °C immediately after opening the ampoules 
and should be processed without delay for the certified values in Table 1 to be valid within the stated uncertainty. 
Because of the volatility of 2,2,4-trimethylpentane, certified values are not applicable to material stored in ampoules 
that have been opened for more than 5 minutes, even if they are resealed. 
 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS 
 
The  compounds  used  in  the  preparation  of  this  SRM  were  obtained  from  Chiron  AS  (Trondheim, Norway).    The 
solution was prepared at NIST by weighing and mixing the individual compounds and 2,2,4-trimethylpentane.  The 
weighed components were added to the 2,2,4-trimethylpentane and mixed overnight.  The total mass of this solution 
was  measured,  and  the  concentrations  were  calculated  from  this  gravimetric  procedure.    These  gravimetric 
concentrations  were  adjusted  for  the  purity  estimation  of  each  component,  which  was  determined  using  flame 
ionization capillary gas chromatography with two stationary phases of different polarities.  From this bulk solution, 
1.2 mL aliquots were dispensed into 2 mL amber glass ampoules, which were then flame sealed. 
 
Aliquots from nine ampoules (selected using a stratified, random sampling scheme) were analyzed in duplicate by 
using capillary gas chromatography/mass spectrometry with a non-polar 5 % phenyl methylpolysiloxane phase.  The 
internal  standards  added  to  each  sample  for  quantification  purposes  were  deuterated  polycyclic  aromatic 
hydrocarbons.    Calibration  solutions  consisting  of  weighed  amounts  of  the  compounds  (adjusted  for  the  purity 
estimation)  and  the  internal  standard  compounds  in  2,2,4-trimethylpentane  were  chromatographically  analyzed  to 
determine analyte response factors.

(a) The  results  are  expressed  as  the  certified  value  ±  the  expanded  uncertainty.    The  certified  value  is  the  average  of  the 
concentrations determined by gravimetric and chromatographic measurements.  The expanded 95 % uncertainty uses a coverage 
factor of 2 and includes both correction for estimated purity and allowance for differences between the concentration determined 
by gravimetric preparation and chromatographic measurements [3].  The measurand is the certified value for each compound 
listed.    Metrological  traceability  is  to  the  derived  SI  unit  for  mass  fraction  (expressed  as  micrograms  per  gram)  and  mass 
concentration (expressed as micrograms per milliliter). 

(b) The concentrations listed in micrograms per milliliter were obtained by multiplying the certified values in micrograms per gram 
by the density of the solution at 20 °C (0.6899 g/mL).  A concentration change of less than 1 % will occur for a 5 °C temperature 
change.
