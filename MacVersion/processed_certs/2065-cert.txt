Ultraviolet–Visible–Near-Infrared Transmission 
Wavelength/Vacuum Wavenumber Standard 

SRM 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is a certified transfer standard intended for the verification and calibration 
of  the  wavelength/wavenumber  scale  of  ultraviolet  (UV)–Visible–Near-Infrared  (NIR)  spectrometers  operating  in 
transmission mode.  In this certificate, spectral features are referred to as bands if their location is determined by the 
center-of-gravity (COG) algorithm, whereas those determined by a five point cubic polynomial fit are referred to as 
peak locations.  SRM 2065 is certified for the location of the seven absorbance bands (COG) in the spectral region 
from  10 300  cm-1  to  5 130 cm-1  at  4 cm-1  resolution.   In addition,  SRM 2065  is  certified  for  the  location  of  seven 
absorbance bands in the spectral region from 970 nm to 1 946 nm and 13 additional transmittance peaks spanning the 
spectral region from 334 nm to 805 nm. 
 
SRM 2065 is a glass consisting of a combination of rare earth oxides of mole fractions 3.00 % holmium oxide (Ho2O3), 
1.30 % samarium oxide (Sm2O3), 0.68 % ytterbium oxide (Yb2O3), and 0.47 % neodymium oxide (Nd2O3) in a base 
glass containing oxides of lanthanum (La2O3), boron (B2O3), silicon (SiO2), and zirconium (ZrO2).  The optical filter 
is 25 mm in diameter and 1.5 mm thick.  This combination of the rare earth oxide concentrations and filter thickness 
yields  absorption  bands  between  0.1  and  0.6  absorbance  units  in  the  NIR  and  5 % to  60 %  transmittance  in  the 
UV-Visible.  
 
Certification:  The certified absorbance/transmittance band locations for SRM 2065 are given in Tables 1, 3, and 5 
of this certificate. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 2065 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until  31  December  2028,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  instructions  given  in  this 
certificate  (see  “Instructions  for  Use”).    The  certification  is  nullified  if  the  SRM  is  damaged,  contaminated,  or 
otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Overall  direction  and  coordination  of  the  technical  measurements  required  for  certification  of  this  SRM  were 
aerly  of  NIST
performed by S.J. Choquette, of NIST and G.W. Kramer, formerly of NIST.

Certified Values:  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that 
all  known  or  suspected  sources  of  bias  have  been  investigated  or  taken  into  account [1].    The  certified  vacuum 
wavenumber locations for the seven absorption bands spanning the range from 10 300 cm-1 to 5 130 cm-1 are listed in 
Table 1.  These values were obtained at 4 cm-1 constant wavenumber resolution and are certified for 25 °C ± 1.5 °C.  
The absorbance spectrum (NIR) of SRM 2065 is illustrated in Figure 1 of this certificate.  Atmospheric water vapor 
is a significant source of variance for band 3, and this band should be used with caution when calibrating commercial 
spectrometers with SRM 2065.  The certified values for the NIR air wavelength band locations for the seven absorption 
bands from 976 nm to 1946 nm for 3 nm spectral resolution at 22 °C ± 2 °C are listed in Table 3.  
 
The  certified  air  wavelength  values  for  the  12  transmittance  peaks  (334 nm  to  645 nm)  of  SRM 2065  in  the 
UV-Visible are listed in Table 5 for 1 nm spectral bandwidth.  The UV–Visible and NIR transmittance spectra of 
SRM 2065 are shown in Figure 2.   
 
Reference Values:  A NIST reference value is a noncertified value that is the best estimate of the true value based on 
available data; however, the values do not meet the NIST criteria for certification [1].  The reference values for the 
vacuum wavenumber locations of the seven absorption bands spanning the range from 10 300 cm-1 to 5 130 cm-1 for 
six  additional  spectral  resolutions  are  listed  in  Table 2.    These values  are  valid  for  filter  temperatures  of 
25 °C ± 1.5 °C.  When using these optical standards to verify the wavenumber scale of a spectrometer, the certified or 
reference values that are most representative of the spectral bandwidth of the spectrometer being tested should be 
used.  The reference values of the NIR (976 nm – 1946 nm) air wavelength band locations of SRM 2065 at 5 nm and 
10 nm spectral resolution are given in Table 4. 
 
The  reference  values  of  the  temperature  coefficients  and  0 °C  intercepts  of  the  vacuum  wavenumber  COG  band 
locations of SRM 2065 at 4 cm-1 resolution are listed in Table 7.  The filter temperature can be a significant source of 
variance of the NIR band locations.  Band locations of the filter were determined using the COG algorithm with a 
10 % band fraction over a temperature range between 6 °C and 59 °C.  The location of each absorbance band as a 
function of temperature was determined by a least-squares fit to obtain the temperature coefficients given in Table 7.   
 
Information  Values:    An  information  value  is  a  value  that  may  be  of  interest  to  the  SRM  user,  but  insufficient 
information is available to assess the uncertainty associated with the value [1].  Information values cannot be used to 
establish metrological traceability.  Information values for the UV–Visible transmittance peak locations of SRM 2065 
as  a  function  of  spectral  resolution  are  given  in  Table 6.    Information  values  for  the  NIR  vacuum  wavelength 
temperature  coefficients  and  0 °C  degree  intercepts  are  given  in  Table 8  for  64  cm-1  and  Table 9  for  128 cm-1 
constant wavenumber resolution.   
 
Uncertainties  for  Certified  and  Reference  Values:    The  expanded  uncertainty  (U95)  for  the  wavenumber  and 
wavelength band locations given in Tables 1 through 5 and 7 are determined from the appropriate combination of 
component standard uncertainties (i.e., estimated standard deviations), with a coverage factor based on the Student’s 
t-distribution, to define the interval within which the unknown value of the band/peak can be asserted to lie with a 
level of confidence of approximately 95 % [2].  Components of the uncertainty for the NIR include: calibration of the 
Fourier  transform (FT)  spectrometers,  COG  location  estimate,  location  shift  due  to  temperature,  and  water  vapor 
interference.  Components of the uncertainty for the UV–Visible wavelength values include instrumental line shape 
anomalies,  instrument  calibration  bias,  and  a  component  to  account  for  bias  between  the  COG  and  cubic  fit  peak 
location methods.  
 
Measurement Conditions:  The certification measurements for the NIR spectral region (10 300 cm-1 to 5 130 cm-1) 
were made using Bruker IFS66 and Bomem DA FT spectrometers(1).  The Bruker FT spectrometer was calibrated in 
vacuum wavenumber units using NIST SRM 2517 Wavelength Reference Absorption Cell-Acetylene [3].  The IFS66 
spectrometer calibration was validated with ambient water vapor bands.  The Bomem spectrometer was calibrated 
using  ambient  water  vapor  and  carbon  dioxide  bands.    The  dispersive,  air  wavelength,  NIR measurements  were 
performed on a Perkin Elmer Lambda 900 (PE900) spectrometer, a Varian Cary 5E spectrometer, and the NIST OTD 
Reference Spectrophotometer for Regular Spectral Transmittance.  The air wavelength axis of the PE900 spectrometer 
was calibrated in the NIR using the emission lines of a Kr atomic emission pen lamp and validated using the values 
for the second order positions of the emission lines of the internal D2 source.  The Varian Cary 5E was calibrated 
using the internal D2 source and an external Hg emission lamp.   
 

                                                           

(1)Certain commercial equipment, instruments, or materials are identified in this certificate in order to adequately specify 
>  of
the  experimental  procedure.    Such  identification  does  not  imply  recommendation  or  endorsement  by  the  National  Institute  of 
Standards and Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the 
purpose.

The  certification  measurements  for  the  UV–Visible  (334 nm  to  804 nm)  air  wavelength  band  locations  were 
obtained using  the  PE900  and  the  NIST  ACD  National  Reference  UV–Visible  Spectrometer  (HAS II) [4].    The 
HAS II instrument is qualified quarterly for photometric and wavelength calibration.  It is wavelength calibrated using 
Hg and Ne atomic emission pen lamps and validated with SRM 2034 Holmium Oxide Wavelength Solution Standard 
from  240 nm  to  650 nm.    The  PE900  was  wavelength  calibrated  in  the  UV–Visible  using  a  Hg  emission  pen 
lamp and validated with SRM 2034 and the emission lines of the internal D2 source.   
 
Details  of  the  measurements  and  data  analysis  for  both  the  NIR  and  UV–Visible  Measurements  can  be  found  in 
reference 5. 
 
Wavenumber and Wavelength Band Location Methodology:  The method used to determine the certified NIR 
wavenumber (υ) and wavelength (λ) band locations of SRM 2065 is the COG technique [6-8].  If another technique is 
used, a comparison with the certified values may not be valid.  In this certificate, positions determined with the COG 
algorithm  are  referred  to  as  band  locations,  whereas  those  determined  by  a  five-point  cubic  polynomial  fit  to  the 
transmittance minimum, are referred to as peak locations.  Only those values listed in Tables 5 and 6 (1 nm, 3 nm and 
5 nm resolution UV–Visible peak transmittance locations) are peak locations.  For COG calculations, a 10 % fraction 
of the band was used for both wavenumber and wavelength absorption data.  Further information on the use of this 
algorithm with other NIST SRMs can be found in Reference [8]. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
Handling  and  Storage:    To  maintain  the  integrity  of  SRM 2065,  the  filter  should  only  be  handled  in  its  optical 
mount.  While  not  in  use,  the  SRM  should  be  stored  in  the  container  provided  or  one  with  similar  or  better 
mechanical protection.  
 
Use:  Carefully insert SRM 2065 into the sample beam of the spectrometer being tested.  Measurements under a dry 
nitrogen purge are highly recommended.  If a nitrogen purge is not available, the locations of band 1 and band 3 may 
differ significantly from the certified values.  Acquire the absorbance/transmittance spectrum, referenced to air, at a 
nominal  temperature  of  25 °C ± 1.5 °C.    Compare  each  measured  band  location  to  its  certified  value  listed  in  the 
appropriate table (Tables 1, 3, or 5) for the spectral bandwidth most representative of the spectrometer being used.  
Band locations in Tables 1 and 2 are vacuum wavenumber values, while those in Tables 3 and 5 are air wavelength 
values.    To  convert  the  values  in  Tables 1  and 2  to  air  wavenumber, the  appropriate  correction  for  the  index  of 
refraction of air must be applied [9].  Taking into account the certification uncertainty of each band of SRM 2065, any 
statistically significant differences between the measured and certified band locations may then be used to recalibrate 
the spectrometer wavenumber/wavelength scale.

(a) A NIST certified value is a  value for which NIST has  the highest confidence in its accuracy in that all known or  suspected 
sources of bias have been taken into account [1].  The measurands are the band locations.  The certified values are metrologically 
traceable to the derived SI unit of meters (m), expressed as nanometers (nm). 

(b) Uncertainties represent U95, the expanded uncertainty calculated in accordance with reference 2. 
(c) An information value is a value that may be of interest to the SRM user, but insufficient information is available to assess the 

uncertainty associated with the value.  Information values cannot be used to establish metrological traceability.

(a) A NIST reference value is a noncertified value that is the best estimate of the true value based on available data; however, the 
values do not meet the NIST criteria for certification [1].  The measurands are the band locations as determined by the methods 
as  described  above.    The  values  are  metrologically  traceable  to  the  derived  SI  unit  of  reciprocal  meters  (m–1),  expressed  as 
reciprocal centimeters (cm–1). 

(b) Uncertainties represent U95, the expanded uncertainty calculated in accordance with reference 2. 
(c) An information value is a value that may be of interest to the SRM user, but insufficient information is available to assess the 
the

uncertainty associated with the value.  Information values cannot be used to establish metrological traceability.
