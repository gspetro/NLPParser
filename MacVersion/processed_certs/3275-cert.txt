Omega-3 and Omega-6 Fatty Acids in Fish Oil 

|  mass  fraction 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended primarily for validation of methods for determining fatty acids 
in fish oils and similar materials.  This SRM can also be used for quality assurance when assigning values to in-house 
reference materials.  SRM 3275 consists of three individual oils:  Part 3275-1, a concentrate high in docosahexaenoic 
acid (DHA);  Part 3275-2,  an  anchovy  oil  high  in  DHA  and  eicosapentaenoic  acid (EPA);  and  Part 3275-3,  a 
concentrate containing 60 % long-chain omega-3 fatty acids.  A unit of SRM 3275 consists of two ampoules of each 
of the three oils, each ampoule containing approximately 1.2 mL of material. 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values:  The certified mass fraction values for fatty acids are provided in Table 1.  A NIST 
certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that all known or suspected 
sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [1].  Analyses for value assignment were performed by 
NIST using two independent methods.  All certified values are calculated as the mean of the mean values from each 
method.  The associated uncertainties are expressed at the 95 % level of confidence [2–4].  Values are reported on an 
as-received basis in mass fraction units [5]. 
 
Reference Mass Fraction Values:  Reference mass fraction values for additional fatty acids are provided in Table 2.  
A NIST reference  value is a  noncertified value that is the  best estimate of the true  value based on available data; 
however, the value does not meet the NIST criteria for certification [1] and is provided with associated uncertainties 
that may reflect only measurement reproducibility, may not include all sources of uncertainty, or may reflect a lack of 
sufficient statistical agreement among multiple analytical methods.  Values are reported on an as-received basis in 
mass fraction units [5]. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 3275 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until 31 March 2024, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with instructions given in this certificate 
(see  “Instructions  for  Handling,  Storage,  and  Use”).    The  certification  is  nullified  if  the  SRM  is  damaged, 
contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification.

HANDLING, 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
Handling:  FOR RESEARCH USE; NOT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. 
 
Storage:  The SRM should be stored under refrigeration (2 °C to 8 °C), in an unopened ampoule, until required for use.  
The certification does not apply to contents of previously opened and stored ampoules, as the stability of fatty acids 
has not been investigated. 
 
Use:    Before  use,  the  contents  of  the  ampoule  should  be  mixed  thoroughly.    For  certified  values  to  be  valid,  test 
portions of at least 0.5 g should be used. 
 
SOURCE, PREPARATION, AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Source and Preparation:  The SRM consists of three individual fish oils:  Part 3275-1, a concentrate high in DHA; 
Part 3275-2,  an  anchovy  oil  high  in  EPA  and  DHA;  and  Part 3275-3,  a  concentrate  containing  60 %  long-chain 
omega-3  fatty  acids (Ocean  Nutrition,  Dartmouth, NS, Canada).    Mixed  natural  tocopherols  at  a  minimum  mass 
fraction  of  1 mg/g  were  added  as  an  antioxidant  to  all  three  oils  by  Ocean  Nutrition.    The  oils  were  ampouled 
individually in amber glass ampoules that were flushed with argon.  Each ampoule contains nominally 1.2 mL.  The 
materials were stored at 4 °C following ampouling. 
 
Analytical Approach for Determination of Fatty Acids:  Value assignment of the concentrations of fatty acids in 
SRM 3275 was based on the combination of measurements made using two independent analytical methods at NIST: 
gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC–FID) and GC with mass spectrometric detection (GC/MS) 
as described below. 
 
For  GC-FID,  two  0.5 g  test  portions  from  each  of  10 ampoules  of  the  three  oils  comprising  SRM 3275  were  
combined  with  an  internal  standard  solution  containing  octacosanoic  acid  and  myristic-d27  acid.    MethPrep II 
[0.1 mol/L  methanolic  (m-trifluoromethylphenyl)trimethylammonium  hydroxide,  Alltech,  Deerfield, IL]  and 
2,2,4-trimethylpentane  were  added  stepwise  for  conversion  of  fatty  acids  to  their  methyl  esters (FAMEs)  prior  to 
analysis by GC-FID using a 0.24 mm × 100 m nonbonded biscyanopropyl polysiloxane fused silica capillary column.  
Calibrants were prepared gravimetrically, at levels intended to approximate the levels of the fatty acids in the SRM.  
A single internal standard solution was used for the calibrants and samples.  Calculations are based on average response 
factors for the calibrants. 
 
For GC/MS, two 0.5 g test portions from each of 10 ampoules of the three oils comprising SRM 3275 were combined 
with an internal standard solution containing octacosanoic acid and myristic-d27 acid.  A two-step process employing 
methanolic  sodium  hydroxide  and  boron  trifluoride  was  used  to  convert  the  fatty  acids  to  FAMEs.    GC/MS  was 
performed  using  a  0.25 mm × 60  m  fused  silica  capillary  column  containing  a  50 %  cyanopropyl + 50 % 
phenylpolysiloxane (mole fraction) phase.  Calibrants were prepared gravimetrically, at levels intended to approximate 
the levels of the fatty acids in the SRM.  A single internal standard solution was used for the calibrants and samples.  
Calculations are based on average response factors for the calibrants. 
 
and  test  portion 
Homogeneity Assessment:  The homogeneity of fatty acids was assessed at NIST using the methods and test portion 
sizes described above; analysis of variance did not show statistically significant heterogeneity. 
 
Value  Assignment:    For  calculation  of  assigned  values,  the  means  of  the  available  individual  sets  of  data  were 
averaged.

(a) Each certified mass fraction value (as received) is the mean from the combination of the mean from each set of results from analyses by NIST using GC/MS and GC-FID.  The uncertainty 
provided with each value is an expanded uncertainty about the mean to cover the measurand with approximately 95 % confidence.  It expresses both the observed difference between the results 
from the methods and their respective uncertainties, consistent with the ISO/JCGM Guide and its supplement 1 [2–4].  The expanded uncertainty is calculated as U = kuc where uc is intended to 
represent, at the level of one standard deviation, the effects of the combined components of uncertainty, and where the coverage factor k = 2 for a 95 % confidence internal (approximately) for 
each analyte. 

(b) The measurand is the mass fraction for the fatty acids listed as FAMEs.  The certified values are metrologically traceable to the SI derived unit for mass fraction, expressed as milligrams per 

gram.

(a) Each reference mass fraction value (as received) is the mean of a single set of results from analyses by NIST using GC-FID, except where noted.  The uncertainty provided with each value is an 
expanded uncertainty about the mean to cover the measurand with approximately 95 % confidence, consistent with the ISO/JCGM Guide [2].  The uncertainty incorporates within-measurement 
uncertainty.  The expanded uncertainty is calculated as U = kuc where uc is intended to represent, at the level of one standard deviation, the effects of the combined components of uncertainty, 
and k is a coverage factor corresponding to approximately 95 % confidence for each analyte.
