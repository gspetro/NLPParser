Enthalpy of Fusion 
(J • g–1) 

Fusion Temperature 
(K) 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended for use in calibrating differential scanning calorimeters (DSC), 
differential  thermal  analyzers,  and  similar  instruments.    A  unit  of  SRM 2234  consists  of  a  small  ingot 
(approximately 2 g) of high purity gallium (99.999 99 %), sealed in a polyethylene vial.  The enthalpy of fusion and 
the fusion temperature were measured in an adiabatic calorimeter.  Complete details of the measurements are given 
in reference 1. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The certified values were obtained from a set of 35 adiabatic calorimetric measurements in the temperature range of 
288.6 K  to  314.35 K.    The  methods  used  for  determination  of  the  certified  values  are  given  in  reference 1.    The 
fusion temperature is the freezing point temperature on the International Temperature Scale of 1990. 
 
The average of three determinations of the enthalpy of fusion, after adjusting the measured enthalpy increments for 
the  pre-fusion  and  post-fusion  enthalpy  increment  contributions,  was  80.097 J • g–1.    The  standard  deviation 
calculated was 0.0057 J • g–1 and the standard deviation of the mean was 0.0033 J • g–1.  A coverage factor of 4 was 
used  to  calculate  the  uncertainty  of  the  value  of  the  enthalpy  change  due  to  fusion,  ± 0.013 J • g–1,  which 
corresponded to ± 0.016 % of the enthalpy of fusion.  To this quantity, estimated uncertainties of the extrapolations 
of  the  crystal-phase  enthalpy  function,  ∆Hcr (T1 → 302.9146 K),  and  of  the  calculated  liquid-phase  enthalpy 
increments, ∆Hl (302.9146 K → T2), were added.  To estimate these uncertainties, twice the root-mean-square (rms) 
deviation for the representations of the enthalpy increment measurements of the liquid and crystal phases, ± 0.07 %, 
tity 
was used to estimate the uncertainty of the sum of the pre-fusion and post-fusion enthalpy increments.  This quantity 
is approximately ± 0.019 J • g–1 and corresponds to ± 0.024 % of the enthalpy of fusion.  The combination of these 
uncertainties gives ± 0.032 J • g–1, which corresponds to a 95 % confidence interval [3]. 
 
Expiration  of  Certification:    The  certification  of  SRM 2234  is  valid,  within  the  measurement  uncertaintiy 
specified, until 01 August 2018, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given 
in this certificate (see “Instructions for Handling, Storage, and Use”).  This certification is nullified if the SRM is 
damaged, contaminated, or modified.

Maintenance  of  SRM  Certification:    NIST  will  monitor  this  SRM  over  the  period  of  its  certification.    If 
substantive  technical changes occur that affect the certification before the expiration of this certificate, NIST  will 
notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification.

ING,  STORAGE,  AND  USE 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
Sample-enclosure Devices:  Commercially available sample-enclosure devices for differential scanning calorimetry 
or differential thermal analysis are fabricated from a variety of sources such as aluminum, gold, alumina, and steel. 
Of  these  commercial  sample-holder  materials,  aluminum  is  used  most  commonly  because  of  low  cost  and  good 
thermal  characteristics.    Gallium  alloys  rapidly  with  aluminum  and  its  alloys.    However,  some  aluminum  sample 
holders  that  have  been  subjected  to  a  heat  treatment  (placed  in  an  oven  at  843 K  for  more  than  one  hour)  show 
resistance  to  alloying  that  allows  use  of  the  gallium  for  a  short  period  of  time.    Note  that  this  heat  treatment 
procedure  works  with  some,  not  all,  sample  holders  from  manufacturers.    Some  aluminum  sample-holder 
components have acquired a brownish color after or while being subjected to the heat treatment; these components 
invariably reacted with an enclosed sample of gallium.  Anodization of aluminum pans is not the same thing as the 
heat treatment described above.

Storage Instructions:  When not in use, store SRM 2234 in the packaging provided or in a manner that provides 
equivalent or better protection against loss or damage. 
 
Use:  Specific instructions  for use, other than those  specified above regarding the stabilization of aluminum DSC 
pans prior to use with this material, depend on the calibration protocol being used.  Reference 2 is one such protocol.
