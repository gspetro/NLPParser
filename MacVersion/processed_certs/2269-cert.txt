Standard Reference Material 2269 
Perdeuterated PAH-I Solution in Hexane/Toluene 

 

 

 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended primarily for use as an internal standard, or surrogate internal 
standard, solution that is used to spike both the unknown sample and the calibration or external standard solution of 
non-labeled PAHs.  The approach to the quantitation of PAHs using perdeuterated PAHs as internal standards has 
been  discussed  in  detail  in  reference 1.    A  unit  of  SRM  2269  consists  of  five  2  mL  ampoules,  each  containing 
approximately  1.2 mL  of  a  solution  of  five  perdeuterated  polycyclic  aromatic  hydrocarbons (PAHs)  in 
hexane/toluene (96:4 volume fraction).   
 
Certified  Concentrations  of  Constituent  Perdeuterated  PAHs:    The  certified  concentration  values  for  five 
perdeuterated PAHs are given in Table 1.  These values are based on results obtained from the gravimetric preparation 
of this solution and from the analytical results determined by using gas chromatography.  A NIST certified value is a 
value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias have 
been investigated or accounted for by NIST [2].  Please note however, the extent of deuteration is always less than 
100 % for perdeuterated compounds.  The certified concentrations in Table 1 represent the sums of all isotopomers 
for each compound.   
 
Information Values:  The expected deuterium enrichments, as reported by the supplier and confirmed at NIST, are 
listed in Table 2.  During mass spectrometric analysis, however, the extent of hydrogen-deuterium exchange can be 
affected by the source conditions in both electron ionization and chemical ionization mass spectrometer sources [3−6].  
A summary of the gravimetric and gas chromatographic measurements for SRM 2269 is also provided in Table 2.  
This information is NOT to be used as a substitute for NIST certified values.  Information values cannot be used to 
establish metrological traceability. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification SRM 2269 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until 15 November 2029, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given in this 
certificate  (see  “Instructions  for  Use”).    The  certification  is  nullified  if  the  SRM  is  damaged,  contaminated,  or 
otherwise modified.  
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Coordination of  the  technical  measurements  leading  to the  certification of  this  SRM was under  the direction of 
S.A. Wise of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division, and M.M. Schantz formerly of NIST.

Consultation  on  the  statistical  design  of  the  experimental  work  and  evaluation  of  the  data  were  provided  by

Atmospheric  Administration,  National  Ocean  Service,  Center 
for  Coastal  Monitoring  and 
Assessment (Silver Spring, MD).

Materials.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 
 
Handling:  This material contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, many of which have been reported to have toxic, 
mutagenic, and/or carcinogenic properties, and should be handled with care.  Use proper disposal methods. 
 
Storage:  Sealed ampoules, as received, should be stored in the dark at temperatures lower than 30 °C. 
 
Opening of Ampoule:  Open ampoules carefully to prevent contamination and injury.  The ampoules are prescored 
and  should  NOT  be  opened  using  a  file.    Sample  aliquots  for  analysis  should  be  withdrawn  at  20 °C  to  25 °C 
immediately after opening the ampoules and should be processed without delay for the certified values in Table 1 to 
be  valid  within  the  stated  uncertainties.    Because  of  the  volatility  of  hexane  and  toluene,  certified  values  are  not 
applicable to material stored in ampoules that have been opened for more than 2 minutes, even if they are resealed. 
 
Use of SRM 2269 as an Internal Standard:  To minimize the problem of not knowing the extent of deuteration and 
the effect of hydrogen-deuterium exchange, this solution is to be used to spike the unknown sample and the external 
standard solution.  If the relative quantities of SRM 2269 added to the unknown sample and the external standard 
solution are accurately known, the absolute concentrations of the perdeuterated compounds are not relevant to the 
quantitation.  This approach has been discussed in detail elsewhere in references 1 and 6.   
 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS 
 
SRM Preparation:  The perdeuterated PAHs used in the preparation of this SRM were obtained from Cambridge 
Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA).  The solution was prepared at NIST by weighing and mixing the individual 
perdeuterated PAHs first with toluene and then adding the hexane.  The weighed components were added to the toluene 
and mixed until completely dissolved.  The hexane was then added, and the solution was homogenized.  The total 
mass of this solution was measured and the concentrations calculated from this gravimetric procedure are given in 
Table 2 for the components. These gravimetric concentrations were adjusted for the consensus purity estimation of 
each component which was determined by using capillary gas chromatography with flame ionization detection and 
differential scanning calorimetry.  This bulk solution was then chilled to approximately –5 °C and 1.2 mL aliquots 
were dispensed into 2 mL amber glass ampoules which were then flame sealed. 
 
SRM Analysis:  Aliquots from nine randomly selected ampoules were analyzed in duplicate by using capillary gas 
chromatography/mass  spectrometry  employing  an  immobilized  non-polar  stationary  phase  column.    An  internal 
standard solution was added to each sample for quantification purposes.  Calibration solutions consisting of weighed 
amounts of the perdeuterated PAHs (adjusted for the consensus purity estimation) and internal standard compounds 
in hexane/toluene (96:4 volume fraction) were chromatographically analyzed to determine analyte response factors.  
The analytical values determined for the compounds also are given in Table 2.

(a) Each result is expressed as the certified value ± the expanded uncertainty.  The certified value is the unweighted average of the 
concentrations determined by gravimetric and chromatographic measurements.  The expanded uncertainty, at the 95 % level of 
confidence,  is  calculated  as  U  =  kuc,  where  uc  is  a  combined  standard  uncertainty  calculated  according  to  the  ISO/JCGM 
Guide [7] and k = 2 is the coverage factor.  The value of uc includes both a correction for estimated purity and an allowance for 
differences between the concentration determined by gravimetric preparation and chromatographic measurements.  The certified 
values are metrologically traceable to the SI derived unit of mass fraction (expressed as milligrams per kilograms).

(b) The certified concentrations, in µg/mL units, were obtained by multiplying the certified mass values by the measured density of 
the SRM solution at 20 °C (0.6648 g/mL).  These concentrations are for use over the temperature range of 20 °C to 25 °C, and 
an allowance for the change in density over this temperature range is included in the uncertainties.
