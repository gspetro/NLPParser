Knoop Microhardness of Steel 
 
Serial No.  SAMPLE 

 
This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  intended  for  use  as  a  primary  standard  in  calibrating  Knoop-type 
microhardness testers and is certified for mean Knoop hardness values at a load of 4.90 N (0.500 kgf).  A unit of 
SRM 2828 consists of a steel block, approximately 3.2 cm in diameter and 1 cm in height.  Five indentations were 
made  within  the  inscribed  square  on  the  SRM’s  polished  surface  at  positions  illustrated  in  Figure 1.    The  mean 
Knoop hardness value and the corresponding expanded uncertainty for the mean of the five indentations made are 
presented  in  Table 1.    Knoop  hardness  values  are  reported  as  Knoop hardness  numbers (HK)  in  units  of kgf/mm2 
and SI units of gigapascals (GPa).  Each SRM was individually measured and bears a serial number imprinted on the 
top surface.

Expiration  of  Certification:    The  certification  of  SRM 2828  is  valid  indefinitely,  within  the  measurement 
uncertainty specified, provided the SRM is handled, stored, and used in accordance with the instructions given in 
this  certificate  (see  “Instructions  for  Handling,  Storage,  and  Use”).    Accordingly,  periodic  recalibration  or 
recertification of this SRM is not required.  Aside from indentation, any physical damage or other alteration of the 
surface of the specimen, including all processes that remove surface material such as repolishing, will invalidate the 
certification. 
 
Maintenance  of  SRM  Certification:    NIST  will  monitor  this  SRM  over  the  period  of  its  certification.    If 
substantive technical changes occur that affect the certification, NIST will notify the purchaser.  Registration (see 
attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
The coordination of the production and the technical measurements leading to the certification of SRM 2828 were 
performed by D.R. Kelley of the Thin Film and Nanostructure Processing Group of the NIST Materials Science and 
Engineering Division. 
 
Statistical analysis of the data was performed by N.F. Zhang of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division. 
 
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Office  of  Reference 
Materials.

NIST Specimen Preparation:  A lot of uncalibrated hardness blocks was purchased from a commercial vendor.  A 
nominal  hardness  value  of  800 kgf/mm2  was  requested  from  the  manufacturer.    One  test  block  was  randomly 
selected from the lot and a test pattern of eleven rows and eleven columns of indents was performed in the block’s 
test area.  Each indentation was measured manually once.  For the lot to be accepted, the resultant test data complied 
with the requirement of having a hardness measurement standard deviation no greater than 3 % of the mean value.  
Finally, each of the remaining blocks was certified according to the procedure described below. 
 
Certification Procedure:  The Knoop microindentations are located in the center and near the four corners of the 
block as illustrated in Figure 1.  These indentations were made in accordance with the Knoop hardness test principle, 
in  which  a  diamond  indenter,  in  the  form  of  a  rhombic-based  pyramid,  is  forced  into  the  surface  of  a  test  piece 
followed by measurement of the long diagonal length of the indentation left in the surface after removal of the test 
force.  The full test force was applied for 12.5 seconds with one set of five indentation made.  The certified mean 
HK of this block is given in Table 1.  Analysis of variance (ANOVA) of all data collected led to the treatment of 
position as a statistically significant factor. 
 
Hardness value for this SRM was obtained using a dedicated, calibrated hardness tester.  The loading mechanism of 
the  hardness  tester  was  calibrated  with  a  miniature  precision  load  cell  that  was  calibrated  with  NIST-certified 
weights.    The  indentation  sizes  were  measured  using  an  image  analyzer  calibrated  with  a  NIST-certified  stage 
micrometer.  When using the image analyzer, the microscope’s 200 X dry objective lens was used with a 1 X video 
camera lens.  
 
The HK is obtained by dividing the applied force to the indenter by the projected area of the permanent indentation 
made  by  the  diamond  indenter.    The  HK  is  computed  from  the  following  equation  (taking  into  consideration  the 
Knoop indenter geometry shown in Figure 2):

where A and B are the included angles for the indenter as shown in Figure 2 above, P is the applied force to the

Since the units of gram-force (gf) and micrometers (µm) are normally used in this field, the constant in Equation 2 
can be modified to accommodate the conversion factors to ease use during computation.  The equation for HK, still

Discussion of Uncertainty:  The uncertainty in the average certified value of the Knoop hardness measurement is 
expressed as an expanded uncertainty, U, at the 95 % level of confidence, and is calculated according to the method 
described  in  the  ISO  Guide [1].  The  expanded  uncertainty  is  calculated  as  U = kuc,  where  uc  represents  the 
combined  effect  of  the  individual  sources  of  uncertainty  listed  in  Table 2  and  k = 2  is  the  coverage  factor.  
These  sources  include  uncertainties  due  to  deviations  of  the  NIST  standardizing  tester  and  indenter  from  the 
defined  requirements  for  the  hardness  test  (force,  diagonal  measurement,  test  cycle,  and  indenter  shape) [1].  
The value of uc is individually calculated for each SRM unit.  The expanded uncertainty, U, provides an indication 
of the precision of NIST’s estimate of the true value of the average hardness of this SRM.  The uncertainty should 
not be interpreted as the range in expected hardness values that would be measured across the test surface, nor is it a 
limit  of  acceptable  hardness  values  for  verifying  the  hardness  equipment.    Similarly,  the  uncertainty  components 
listed in Table 2 contribute to the overall uncertainty in the certified average hardness value.  These are not ranges of 
expected hardness results due to each source of uncertainty.

One indentation is made at each of the five positions shown in Figure 1.  The long diagonal of each indentation is 
measured three times.  The average value for the diagonal length and the corresponding standard deviation are listed 
as information values in Table 3.  The average of the 15 hardness values  calculated using each diagonal length is 
used as the certified hardness value.  The standard deviation for the average of the measurements of the five indents

INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
The  metallic  block  is  durable  but  may  be  susceptible  to  tarnish  or  corrosion  in  an  environment  of  high  humidity 
and/or acidic sulfur or chlorine bearing gases or liquids.  Oils, fingerprints, or skin oils should be removed from the 
SRM before and after use.  The SRM unit may be cleaned with ethyl alcohol and soft wipe materials. The surface 
polish should be protected from abuse.  The blocks must NEVER BE REPOLISHED, as this will invalidate the 
certification. 
 
This SRM is intended for use with microhardness testing machines whereby a Knoop indentation can be made and 
then measured with an optical microscope.  When using this SRM, a minimum of five indentations must be made 
for accurate comparison to the certified mean HK and expanded uncertainty. 
 
When making new indentations in the block, special care should be taken to ensure that the loading rates and load 
duration are as prescribed by the applicable Knoop hardness test method standard.  There should be no vibrations or 
impact imparted to the machine during the indentation cycle.  The surface of the test block and the indenter must be 
clean  and  should  not  contain  skin  oils,  which  could  alter  the  friction  between  the  indenter  and  block  surface.  
Indentations may be placed in any region of polished surface provided that they are not within 1.9 mm of any edge, 
since  slight  edge  rounding  from  polishing  can  distort  the  indentation  shape  and  affect  the  size.    Guidelines  for 
indentation spacing can be found in applicable Knoop hardness test method standards.  
 
When measuring indentations, proper illumination and focus of the indentation tips are critical to obtain good clarity 
and contrast.  The apparent indentation size will be affected by the magnification used since the numerical aperture 
of the objective lens establishes the resolution limits. 
 
Magnifications should be checked by use of a calibrated stage micrometer.  Filar micrometers and image analyzing 
systems should be calibrated with stage micrometers.  Proper use of filar crosshairs is essential.  For best results, it is 
critical that the instructions of the hardness machine manufacturer and the applicable Knoop hardness test method 
standard be followed.
