Standard Reference Material® 1358a 

 

 
Coating Thickness Standard 
 
(Nonmagnetic Coating on Steel) 
 
Set Serial No. Sample 

 
This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  designed  for  calibrating  coating  thickness  gauges  that  employ  magnetic 
principles.  These gauges are used to measure the thickness of nonmagnetic coatings on steel including paint and other 
organic coatings, as well as nonmagnetic metallic coatings.  A unit of SRM 1358a consists of a preconfigured set of 
four 45 mm × 45 mm coupons:   a bare substrate, and three  coupons  with  metallic coatings certified for total coating 
thickness  (nominal  coating  thicknesses  of  80 µm,  255 µm,  and  1000 µm).    Each  coupon  consists  of  an  AISI 1010 
cold-rolled  sheet-steel  substrate  with  the  coated  coupons  possessing  an  additional  uniform  coating  of  copper  that  is 
overplated with a thin protective layer of chromium.  This SRM is one in a series of SRMs prepared to cover a coating 
thickness range from 6 µm to 1935 µm. 
 
Certified Coating Thickness Values:  Certified coating thickness values are provided in Table 1.  A NIST certified 
value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of 
bias  have  been  investigated  or  taken  into  account [1].    The  analytical  methods  used  for  the  characterization  and 
subsequent certification of this SRM included flame atomic absorption spectrometry, optical microscopy, and magnetic 
induction.  The resulting certified values are based upon results from the magnetic induction method and are reported 
as the mean coating thickness of each coupon of the SRM unit.  The uncertainty in the certified value for each coupon 
is expressed as the expanded uncertainty, U, of the mean at the 95 % level of confidence and is calculated according to 
the  GUM  Guide [2],  where  U = kuc,  with  a  coverage  factor,  k = 2,  and  uc,  a  combined  uncertainty  including  the 
estimated uncertainty of the primary standards and the imprecision of the intercomparison of the primary standards to 
the coupon. 
 
Information Coating Thickness Values:  Information coating thickness values reported in Table 2 were obtained by 
converting  the  coating  thickness  values  reported  in  micrometers  from  Table 1  to  mils.    An  information  value  is 
considered to be a value that will be of interest to the SRM user, but insufficient information is available to assess the 
uncertainty associated with the value. 
 
Certified and information coating thickness values listed in Tables 1 and 2 of this certificate are considered the official 
values, should a discrepancy exist between the values listed in the certificate and the label affixed to the sleeve holding 
the coupon. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 1358a is valid indefinitely,  within the uncertainty specified, 
provided the SRM is used infrequently as a primary standard and the unit is handled and stored in accordance with the 
guidelines  given  in  this  certificate  (see  “Notice  and  Warnings  to  Users”).    The  wear  induced  by  the  contact 
measurement  of  the  magnetic  gauges  will  alter  the  thickness  values  stated  in  this  certificate.    The  frequency  of 
replacement or verification of this SRM is determined by the user, based upon the number of uses and the severity of 
wear.  If excessive wear is suspected, the SRM may be returned to NIST for verification.  To verify certification of this 
SRM unit, contact the NIST Thin Film and Nanostructure Processing Group by e-mail at Coating.Thickness@nist.gov, 
by telephone at (301) 975-6400, or by fax at (301) 926-7679. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical changes occur that affect the certification, NIST will notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) 
will facilitate notification.

The  overall  direction  of  the  technical  measurements  leading  to  the  certification  of  this  SRM  was  provided  by 
C.R. Beauchamp of the Thin Film and Nanostructure Processing Group of the NIST Materials Science and Engineering 
Division. 
 
This SRM was produced by D.R. Kelley and measured by H.B. Gates of the Thin Film and Nanostructure Processing 
Group of the NIST Materials Science and Engineering Division. 
 
Statistical analysis was provided by S.D. Leigh of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division. 
 
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Office  of  Reference 
Materials. 
 
NOTICE TO USERS 
 
Notice  to  users:    This  SRM  should  not  be  left  unprotected  in  a  corrosive  laboratory  environment  or  undergo  any 
treatment that would scratch or remove material from the surface of the coupon.  The surfaces of these coupons require 
careful  preservation  and  care  during  storage  and  use  in  order  to  maintain  the  stated  coating  thickness  within  the 
uncertainty reported on this certificate.  The SRM unit may be cleaned with ethyl alcohol and soft wipe materials.  The 
surface polish should be protected from abuse.  The certification is nullified if the coupons are repolished. 
 
Instrument Calibration:  The current published standard magnetic methods for measuring coating thicknesses [3,4] 
should be used as guidelines to maximize the accuracy in coating thickness measurements.  In general, it is not possible 
for the user to achieve the same uncertainty as reported in Table 1 of this certificate when using magnetic-type coating 
thickness gauges calibrated with this SRM.  The overall uncertainty of  the measurement by the user will include the 
contribution due to the uncertainty of this SRM, as well as the uncertainty inherent in the measurements performed by 
the user.  The standard deviation of the measurements performed during the certification process is listed on the label 
affixed  to  the  sleeve  containing  each  coupon.    It  is  reported  to  enable  the  user  to  gauge  the  contribution  due  to 
non-uniformity of the coating, since this  will be a  major contributor  to the  uncertainty of the  values.   This standard 
deviation should not be used  when  performing an error analysis.  Instead, the  user is instructed to use the  expanded 
uncertainty listed in Table 1, since all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account 
in this uncertainty.

All sets also include an uncoated steel coupon that originated from the same lot of the steel used as the  substrate for 
these  SRMs.    The  coupon  is  intended  for  instruments  that  have  the  capability  of  adjusting  their  internal  calibration 
based  on  the  substrate  material  used.    When  applicable,  please  refer  to  the  appropriate  manufacturer’s  instrument 
manual for instructions on how to perform the adjustment.
