Standard Reference Material 1196a 
 
Standard Cigarette for Ignition Resistance Testing 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended for use by laboratories to test the cigarette ignition resistance of 
soft furnishings and their components, and thermal insulation for resistance to cigarette ignition in accordance with 
16 CFR 1632 [1], California Technical Bulletin 117-2013 [2], and 16 CFR 1209 [3].  A unit of SRM 1196a consists 
of two cartons of cigarettes containing 10 packs of 20 cigarettes each.   
 
Certified Ignition Strength Value:  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in 
its accuracy and that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [4].  The 
certified value for the NIST ignition strength is given in Table 1.   
 
A Bayesian statistical analysis [5] was used to establish the ignition strength value and its expanded uncertainty, U, 
from  full  length  burn  tests  of  cigarettes  from  20  cartons  conducted  by  seven  operators  at  NIST.      The  expanded 
uncertainty  given  in  Table 1  is  reported  at  the  95 %  probability  level.    Although  the  expanded  uncertainty  of  the 
certified value was not computed using the methods outlined in the ISO/JCGM Guide [6], the results of the Bayesian 
analysis can be interpreted in essentially the same way as results from the ISO approach.  The expanded uncertainty 
can be expressed as U = kuc, where uc = 1 % is the combined standard uncertainty, and the coverage factor, k = 2, is 
based on a normal distribution.

Modification  of  ASTM E 2187  for  Measuring  the  Ignition  Propensity  of  Conventional  Cigarettes,  June 2009.    Metrological 
traceability of this result is to the method used (ASTM E2187). 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 1196a is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
ce  with  the  instructions  given  in  this 
until 01 February 2025, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given in this 
certificate (see “Warning and Instructions for Storage and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, 
contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
ength  of
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST assesses that the fitness for purpose interval for the ignition strength of 
SRM 1196a  is  85 %  to  100 %  and  will  conduct  stability  testing  every  5 years  to  ensure  the  ignition  strength  of 
SRM 1196a has remained within this interval.  In the event that the results of the NIST stability tests indicate ignition 
strength may be outside the fitness for purpose interval before the expiration of this certificate, NIST will notify the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Coordination of the technical measurements leading to certification was performed by R.D. Davis of the NIST Fire 
Research Division.

NOTICE AND WARNINGS TO USERS 
 
THESE CIGARETTES ARE FOR RESEARCH USE ONLY.  THERE ARE SUBSTANTIAL HEALTH HAZARDS 
ASSOCIATED WITH EXPOSURE TO BOTH PRIMARY AND SECOND-HAND SMOKE FROM CIGARETTES.  
THESE  CIGARETTES  ARE  NOT  FOR  HUMAN  CONSUMPTION  AND  ARE  NOT  TO  BE  OFFERED  FOR 
SALE, SOLD, OR DISTRIBUTED TO CONSUMERS.  
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE   
 
Handling:  In general, cigarette test specimens are to be protected from physical or environmental damage while in 
handling and storage.  It is important that the specimens not be crushed or deformed in any manner.  Careful handling 
is  needed  to  ensure  that  the  specimens  are  not  contaminated  while  in  storage  and  that  they  are  protected  from 
degradation by insects.   
 
Storage:  This SRM should be stored in a freezer at approximately –20 °C (–4 °F). 
 
Use:    The  cigarettes  are  intended  for  use  in  testing  prescribed  in  Federal  regulations  (16 CFR 1632 [1], 
16 CFR 1209 [2]) and in California Technical Bulletin 117-2013 [3].  Additional Standards for which the cigarettes 
are  intended,  but  are  not  limited  to,  are  NFPA 260 [9]  and  NFPA 261 [10],  and  ASTM E1352 [11]  and 
ASTM E1353 [12].  These methods describe the procedures for proper handling of the cigarettes and conduct of the 
testing. 
 
Material Selection and Packaging(1): This material was made for the use of the U.S. government and acquired under 
Federal and State tax-exempt status.  Any manufacturing number on the SRM unit are related to the manufacturing 
run of this product and do not affect in any way the values determined for SRM 1196a.  Regulations, 16 CFR 1632 [1], 
16 CFR 1209 [3] and Technical Bulletin 117-2013 [2], standard test methods, NFPA 260 [9] and NFPA 261 [10], and 
ASTM 1352 [11] and ASTM 1353 [12], specify using NIST’s SRM 1196 as the standard cigarette ignition source.   
The  ignition  strength  of  the  replacement  for  SRM 1196,  SRM 1196a,  is  believed  to  be  within  5%  of  that  from 
SRM 1196  with  95 %  probability,  and,  therefore  it  is  expected  these  regulations  and  test  methods  will  adopt 
SRM 1196a as the specified standard ignition source.

consistency with the previous product, SRM 1196, this product is identified as a Standard Reference Material.  
NIST  recognizes  that  given  the  new  definitions  of  a  certified  reference  material  to  include  a  statement  of 
metrological traceability to a higher order reference system (e.g. SI).  This material meets the NIST definition 
of a reference material which states that a reference material is sufficiently homogeneous and stable with respect 
to one or more specified properties, which has been established to be fit for its intended use in a measurement 
process.  The significant difference between a certified and a reference value is that NIST does not believe that 
all or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account and this is correct for this product, 
SRM 1196a.  As SRM 1196 is cited in all applicable codes, NIST will identify this product as an SRM though 
this product is designated solely as a reference material.
