'The  certified  value  listed  for  a  constituent  is  the  present  best  estimate  of  the  “true”  value 
based  on  the  results  of  the  cooperative  program  for  certification. 

“The  estimated  uncertainty  listed  for  a  constituent  is  based  on  judgment  and  represents  an 
evaluation  of  the  combined  effects  of  method  imprecision,  possible  systematic  errors 
among  methods,  and  materiai  variability.  (No  attempt  was  made  to  derive  exact 
statistical  measures  of  imprecision  because  several  methods  were  involved  in  the 
determination  of  most  constituents.) 

The  overall  coordination  of  the  technical  measurements  leading  to  certification  was  performed  under  the  direction  of 
J. 

1.  Shultz,  Research  Associate,  ASTM-NBS  Research  Associate  Program. 

The  technical  and  support  aspects  involved in  the  preparation,  certification,  and  issuance  of  this  Standard  Reference 
Material  were  coordinated  through  the  Office  of  Standard  Reference  Materials  by  R. 

E.  Michaelis.

PLANNING,  PREPARATION,  TESTING,  ANALYSIS: 

The  material  for  this  SRM,  in  the  form  of  small  castings,  was  furnished  to  NBS  gratis,  courtesy  of 
J.  Hammetter, 
Rexnord,  Inc.,  Milwaukee,  Wisconsin.  Under  contract  with  NBS,  the  castings  were  remelted  and  water  atomized  to  fine 
size  granules  at  the  Hoeganaes  Corporation,  Riverton,  New  Jersey.  Following  a  sieve  fraction/composition  study  at 
NBS,  the  entire  lot  was  sieved  and  those  particles  sized  between  0.057  mm  and  0.250  mm  sieve  openings  (250  and 
60  mesh)  were  accepted  for  use  as  SRM  891. 

Homogeneity  testing  was  performed  at  NBS  by  E.R.  Deardorff  and  B.I.  Diamondstone,  Inorganic  Analytical  Research 
Division,  and  by  R.K.  Bell,  ASTM  Assistant  Research  Associate.  The  material  was  determined  to  be  of  exceptionally 
high  homogeneity,  with  the  material  variability  being  well  within  the  imprecision  of  the  analytical  methods. 

Cooperative  analyses  for  certification  were  performed  in  the  following  laboratories: 

American  Cast  Iron  Pipe  Company,  Birmingham,  Alabama,  R.N.  Smith,  L.J.  Moore,  and  D.R.  Denney. 

Foster  Wheeler  Development  Corporation,  Research  Center,  Livingston,  New  Jersey,  M.  Fornoff. 

Johnson  Brass  and  Machine  Foundry,  Saukville,  Wisconsin,  D.C.  Marshall. 
National  Bureau  of  Standards,  Inorganic  Analytical  Research  Division,  Washington,  D.C.,  E.R.  Deardorff, 
B.1.  Diamondstone,  M.S.  Epstein,  S.  Hanamura,  W.R.  Kelly,  R.M.  Lindstrom,  G.J.  Lutz,  P.J.  Paulsen,  and  R.K.  Bell
