Filters 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended for use in the verification of the transmittance and absorbance 
scales of spectrophotometers  in  the  ultraviolet  and  visible  spectral  regions.    SRM 2031b  is  a  transfer  standard 
certified  using  the  NIST  Materials  Measurement  Laboratory  Transfer  Spectrophotometer  (MMLTS) [1]  with 
traceability  through  the  NIST  second  generation  High  Accuracy  Spectrophotometer (HAS II),  modeled  after  the 
original instrument [2].  A unit  consists of three individual neutral-density filters in separate metal holders and one 
empty filter holder, all stored in a black anodized-aluminum container [3,4].  The exposed surface of each filter is 
approximately  29 mm × 8 mm,  measuring  from  a  point  1.5 mm  above  the  base  of  the  filter  holder  (see  Figure 1).  
The filter holders are provided with shutters that protect the filters when not in use.  Each filter-containing holder 
bears  an  identification  number  for  the  set  and  an  individual  filter  number  (10,  30,  or  90)  that  corresponds  to  the 
nominal percent transmittance (100 × transmittance) of the filter. 
 
Certified  Values  of  Transmittance  Density  and  Transmittance:    Certified  transmittance  density  values, 
independently  determined  for  each  filter  at  22 °C ± 1 °C  and  at  ten  wavelengths  in  the  ultraviolet  and  visible 
portions of  the  electromagnetic  spectrum,  are  given  in  Table 1.    These  values  are  calculated  from  measured 
transmittances (T) as –log10(T), and should be indicated by the absorbance (A) scale of the spectrophotometer, if the 
filters are measured  with the empty filter holder in the reference beam.  The corresponding certified transmittance 
values  are  given  in  Table  2.    The  expanded  uncertainties  allow  for  possible  changes  due  to  slight  surface 
contamination  and  fundamental  material  effects  over  the  two  year  period  following  certification.    The  certified 
values are valid for instrumental spectral slit width values of 5 nm or less (see “Instrument Dependence Warning”). 
 
Expiration  of  Certification:    This  certification  of  SRM 2031b  is  valid,  within  the  measurement  uncertainty 
specified,  for  two  years  from  the  date  of  certification  listed  in  Tables 1  and 2,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and 
stored in accordance with instructions given in this certificate (see “Instructions for Handling, Storage, and Use”).  
The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification: NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.    Registration  (see  attached  sheet)  will  facilitate  notification.    The  set  may  be  returned  to  NIST  for 
cleaning  and  recertification  as  required  by  expiration  or  contamination.    Recertification  can  be  arranged  by 
contacting  the  NIST  Optical  Filters  Program  at  (301) 975–8533  or  at  optical.filters@nist.gov.    Instructions  for 
recertification are located on the NIST web site [5].

ING,  STORAGE,  AND  USE 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
Handling  and  Storage:    The  SRM 2031b  set  is  stored  in  an  aluminum  container  to  minimize  contamination  of 
the filter  surfaces  with  particulate  matter  due  to  static  charge.    Each  filter  is  placed  in  a  cylindrical  cavity  to 
prevent any  contact  between  the  filter  face  and  the  walls  of  the  storage  container.    Each  filter  holder  is  provided 
with a flat leaf spring that is inserted into the cylindrical cavity of the unit for transportation.  These springs should 
be removed  during  use.    It  is  recommended  that  the  filter  in  the  holder  be  handled  only  by  the  edges  with  soft, 
powder-free,  polyethylene  gloves,  and  optical  lens  tissue.    When  not  in  use,  the  filters  should  be  stored  in  the 
supplied storage container.  Extended exposure to laboratory atmosphere and dusty surroundings should be avoided.  
If  the  surface  of  the  filter  becomes  contaminated,  the SRM  set  should  be  returned  to  NIST  for  recertification;  do 
NOT attempt to clean it.  Note:  Improper storage or handling of the filters may cause changes in the transmittance. 
 
Use:    The  measured  transmittance  of  the  filters  depends  upon  the  intrinsic  properties  of  the  material  and  the 
wavelength and geometry of the optical beam.  It can be affected by other factors such as stray light, temperature, 
and  the  positioning  of  the  filter.    Changes  in  the  transmittance  may  be  caused  by  changes  in  surface  conditions, 
aging  of  the  filter,  exposure  to  a  harmful  atmosphere,  or  improper  handling [3,4].    Because  the  transmittance  of 
these filters exhibits appreciable optical neutrality, the dependence of transmittance on slit width is not anticipated, 
and spectral slit widths up to 5 nm may be used (See “Instrument Dependence Warning”). 
 
Instrument verification  should be performed at a sample temperature between 20 °C and 24 °C.  The empty filter 
holder provided is to be used in the reference beam of the spectrophotometer so that approximately equivalent stray 
radiation conditions are maintained for both beams.  The shutters provided with each filter must be removed at the 
time of measurement and replaced after the measurements have been completed.  Measurements performed outside 
of these specified conditions or the optical geometry used for certification (see “Determination of Transmittances”) 
could produce transmittance values that differ from the certified values. 
 
To  demonstrate  that  a  user’s  measurements  are  traceable,  within  acceptable  limits,  to  the  accuracy  transferred  by 
SRM 2031b,  the  user  must  first  determine  the  required  tolerances  or  acceptable  uncertainty  for  the  application  in 
question.  It is recommended that a number of replicate measurements be made for each filter and wavelength, with 
removal and replacement of the filter between replicate measurements.  The user should then compare each mean 
value and the user-defined tolerance with the NIST certified value and expanded uncertainty in Table 1 or Table 2.  
An acceptable level of agreement between a user’s measurements and the certified value is demonstrated if any part 
of  the  range  defined  by  the  NIST  certified  value  and  its  expanded  uncertainty  overlaps  any  part  of  the  user’s 
tolerance band defined by the measured mean and the user-defined level of acceptable uncertainty [6]. 
 
Instrument  Dependence  Warning:    In  some  commercial  instruments,  the  metal-on-fused-silica  filters  can  generate 
reflection effects in the sample compartment that can degrade the accuracy of the measured transmittances.  During 
the  development  of  SRM 2031,  the  presence  and  magnitude  of  such  effects  were  studied  and  were  found  to  be 
negligible, within the uncertainty specified, in the spectrophotometers tested [4].  However, for certain instruments, 
these effects could become significant.  In addition, unexpected spectral bandwidth effects have also been reported 
in some commercial instruments.  If such effects are detected or suspected, the user should contact NIST Biosystems 
and Biomaterials Division, at (301) 975-4117 or via email at optical.filters@nist.gov for assistance and instructions 
as described in reference 5.  
 
'ALUE  ASSIGNMENT  ? 
PREPARATION AND VALUE ASSIGNMENT(1) 
 
Preparation:    The  neutral  density  inserts  to  filters 10  and 30  were  produced  by  evaporating  different  thicknesses  
of  inconel  metal  alloy  onto  3.0 mm  thick  fused-silica  plates  that  have  been  precision  ground  and  polished  by 
Starna  Cells, Inc.,  (Atascadero, CA).    The  evaporative  inconel  coating  was  applied  by  CVI  Laser  Corporation 
(Albuquerque, NM).  The metal films are protected by a 10 nm thick evaporated layer of silicon dioxide applied by 
Precision Photonics Corporation (Boulder, CO).  Filter 90 is produced using an uncoated fused-silica plate identical 
to the substrates used for the other two filters.  Each fused-silica piece used in SRM 2031b has been polished to a 
flatness of two fringes of the mercury green line (546.1 nm), and assembled filters were tested for a deviation from 
parallelism  of  less  than  2 × 10-4  radians.    Prior  to  certification  measurements,  the  filters  were  aged  at  NIST  for  a 
minimum of six months, and each filter was examined for surface defects.  SRM 2031b differs from the prior series 
by using an evaporated silicon dioxide protective overcoating rather than a protective cover plate in the construction.

(1) Certain commercial equipment, instrumentation, or materials are identified in this certificate to adequately specify the 
experimental  procedure.    Such  identification  does  not  imply  recommendation  or  endorsement  by  the  National  Institute  of 
Standards and Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the 
purpose.

Determination of Transmittances:  The transmittance measurements are made with the empty filter holder used as 
the reference at an ambient temperature of 22 °C ± 1 °C using an Agilent Cary 6000i spectrophotometer qualified as 
a  transfer  spectrophotometer [1].    Transmittance  traceability  is  maintained  by  comparison  measurements  to  the 
second generation NIST HAS II [2] with the results of the comparison reflected in the certification uncertainties [1].  
The effective spectral slit width used to determine the certified values is 0.8 nm.  The transmittance measurements 
are made by projecting the vertical image of the slit onto the middle of the entrance face of the filter, with the optical 
centerline  15 mm  above  the  base  of  the  filter.    The  filter  is  mounted  in  a  multiple  filter  carriage  in  the 
spectrophotometer.    Each  transmittance  value  reported  in  Table 2  is  the  average  of  three  transmittance  values 
measured with a one second averaging time,  with the instrument cycling through the ten wavelengths, three times 
for each filter in the carriage.  The filters are measured in the spectrophotometer in a position perpendicular to the 
incident  light  beam,  as  shown  in  Figure 1.    Each  transmittance  value  is  calculated  from  a  measurement  of  the 
intensity transmitted through the filter and a measurement of the blank (empty filter holder) at the beginning of the 
measurement of each set of three filters.  Transmittance is monitored for temporal drift several times over the filter 
aging period of six months; the aging period is extended for sets with excessive drift.  Only the final measurements 
are used as the basis for the certified values. 
 
Uniformity:  The transmittance density uniformity of each SRM 2031b filter is tested at five certified wavelengths 
by comparing the transmittance density  measured at the center of each  filter  with that  measured 5 mm above and 
below the center.  Filters are rejected if the relative difference of the two readings exceeds the allowable limits that 
have been established.  These limits are reflected in the uncertainty determination.  
 
Traceability:    Traceability  in  regular  spectral  transmittance  is  achieved  by  comparative  measurements  of 
metal-on-fused-silica neutral-density  filters on the MMLTS and the HAS II.  The master set of reference filters is 
the
calibrated annually by the HAS II and measured at least quarterly on the MMLTS to assess the comparability of the 
scales.  The comparison measurements are used to compute the bias of the MMLTS with respect to the HAS II for 
each nominal transmittance density level and wavelength [1]. 
 
Determination of Expanded Uncertainties:  The expanded uncertainties, U, of the certified transmittance density 
values of Table 1 are determined from  the  measured bias and from standard uncertainties (i.e., estimated standard 
deviation equivalents) of component uncertainty sources discussed below, and a coverage factor k = 2 based on the 
Student’s t-distribution [1,7].  The expanded uncertainty defines an interval within which the unknown value of the 
transmittance  density  would  be  asserted  to  lie  with  a  level  of  confidence  of  approximately  95 %  for  more  than 
30 degrees of freedom (DF).  This uncertainty includes “Type A” uncertainties evaluated by statistical methods and 
“Type B” uncertainties evaluated by other means [7]. 
 
Bias determination for traceability was by means of three independent measurements made on each of two control 
sets on the MMLTS and on the HAS II.  The average and sample standard deviation of the bias were computed for 
each filter level (10, 30, or 90) and wavelength.  The maximum value of the bias and of the standard uncertainty of 
the  bias  over  all  ten  wavelengths  were  assigned  to  conservatively  represent  all  wavelengths  at  that  level.    The 
resulting  bias  and  standard  uncertainty  of  the  bias  were  combined  with  the  uncertainty  components  representing 
filter  properties  and  direct  measurement  properties  as  described  in  reference 1  to  yield  the  final  expanded 
uncertainty values reflected in Tables 1 and 2. 
 
Most  of  the  Type B  uncertainty  components  were  estimated  from  studies  described  in  NIST  Special 
Publication 260-68 [4].    These  components  include  uniformity  (see  “Uniformity”),  temporal  stability  (drift), 
temperature dependence, and the linearity and geometry of the measurement.  The Type B standard uncertainties are 
derived from an estimate of the ranges of the components [7].
