This  Standard  Reference  Material  (SRM)  is  intended  for  use  in  calibrating  the  wavelength  scale  of  wavelength 
measuring  equipment  in  the  spectral  region  from  1528  nm  to  1563 nm.    SRM  2519  is  an  optical-fiber-coupled 
absorption  cell  containing  hydrogen  cyanide  (H13C14N)  gas.    Hydrogen  cyanide  has  more  than  50  accurately 
measured absorption lines in the 1500 nm wavelength region. 
 
Certified  Wavelength  Values:    The  vacuum  wavelengths  of  absorption  lines  in  the  R  and  P  branch  of  the  2ν3 
rotational-vibrational band of H13C14N have been measured previously to high accuracy [1].   NIST has measured the 
line  centers  and  pressure-induced  shifts  of  21  lines  and  certified  their  wavelengths  with  an  expanded  uncertainty 
(coverage  factor  k  =  2)  of  ±  0.0006  nm.    The  remainder  of  the  lines  in  the  band  are  certified  with  an  expanded 
uncertainty  of  ±  0.003  nm,  where  the  uncertainty  is  dominated  by  the  pressure  shift  uncertainty.    Details  of  the 
measurement procedure and data analysis for the determination of the pressure shift can be found in reference 2.  A 
spectrum of the absorption band is shown in Figure 1 and certified wavelength values are given in Table 1.  Figure 2 
shows a higher resolution scan near lines P10 and P11. 
 
Expiration  of  Certification:    The  certification  of  this  SRM  is  indefinite  within  the  measurement  uncertainties 
specified, provided the SRM is handled, stored, and used in accordance with the instructions given in this certificate. 
  
Storage and Handling:  The protective caps provided for the FC/PC fiber connectors should be replaced when the 
SRM is not in use.  This SRM is intended to be used in a laboratory environment near ambient room temperature 
(22 °C ± 5 °C).  Optical alignment is critical; the user should avoid exposing the unit to large temperature variations, 
temperature  cycling,  or  mechanical  shock,  as  these  may  cause  the  optical  alignment  to  degrade.    Optical 
misalignment  affects  the  throughput  of  the  SRM  but  will  not  shift  the  centers  of  the  absorption  lines.    A  more 
serious, but less likely problem, is cell breakage or leakage.  The unit should be replaced if the linewidths or depths 
differ significantly from those shown in Figures 1 and 2 (when measured using comparable resolution). 
  
Development  of  the  SRM  and  supporting  measurements  were  performed  by  S.L.  Gilbert  and  W.C.  Swann  of  the 
NIST Optoelectronics Division. 
 
Statistical consultation was provided by C.M. Wang of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division. 
 
The support aspects involved in the preparation, certification, and issuance of this SRM were coordinated through 
the NIST Standard Reference Materials Program by C.S. Davis of the NIST Measurement Services Division.

Measurement Conditions and Procedure:  The long term stability of hydrogen cyanide and the use of fundamental 
molecular absorption lines render the SRM insensitive to changes in environmental conditions.  The purpose of the 
certification procedure is to verify that the unit contains the correct pressure of H13C14N gas and has no significant 
contaminants that produce additional absorption lines.  Measurements were made using a 0.05 nm resolution optical 
spectrum analyzer.  Spectra similar to those shown in Figures 1 and 2 were taken of each SRM unit and compared 
with  measurements  of  reference  absorption  cells  maintained  at  NIST.    High  resolution  scans using a tunable laser 
and wavelength meter were made on at least one unit of each production run.  These scans serve to verify the center 
wavelength of a selected line with an expanded uncertainty of less than ± 0.0006 nm. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 
 
General Considerations:  The SRM can be used to calibrate a wavelength measuring instrument in the 1530 nm to 
1560 nm region.  The wavelength calibration is vacuum wavelength; if the user requires the wavelength in air, the 
appropriate correction for the index of refraction of air must be applied [3].  Depending on the type of instrument 
being calibrated, a broadband source or a tunable narrowband source may be used. 
 
Use With a Broadband Source:  A broadband source in the 1500 nm region (such as a light emitting diode, white 
light,  or  amplified  spontaneous  emission  source)  is  useful  when  calibrating  a  low  resolution  instrument  such  as  a 
diffraction  grating  based  optical  spectrum  analyzer  or  monochrometer.    A  schematic for this type of calibration is 
shown  in  Figure  3(a).    Light  from  the  broadband  source  is  coupled  into  the  SRM  and  the  output  (transmission 
through the SRM) is connected to the instrument that is being calibrated.  The absorption lines of hydrogen cyanide 
appear as dips in the spectrum of the light source (see Figure 1). 
 
Use With a Narrowband Source:  The SRM can be used to calibrate the wavelength scale of a tunable narrowband 
source in this region (such as a diode laser or fiber laser).  Alternatively, a tunable source and the SRM can be used 
to check the calibration of a wavelength meter, as shown in Figure 3(b).  The laser is tuned over one or more of the 
hydrogen cyanide absorption lines.  The transmission through the SRM is monitored by a detector; the transmitted 
power passes through a minimum at the center of an absorption line. 
 
Suggested Procedure for Low-Accuracy Requirements; Calibration Uncertainty ≥ 0.1 nm:  Connect the light 
source (either broadband or narrowband, as discussed above) to one of the fiber connectors on the SRM unit using a 
single-mode  optical  fiber  terminated  with  a  clean  FC/PC  connector.    After  identifying  the  absorption  lines  by 
comparing  to  the  spectrum  in  Figure  1,  find  the  center  or  the  minimum  point  of  a  line  listed  in  Table  1.    If  the 
instrument has variable resolution, it is best to use a resolution of ≤ 0.2 nm.  For this level of accuracy, the procedure 
used to find the line center can be quite simple: setting a cursor to the line center or minimum by eye is sufficient.  If 
using  a  tunable  source,  simply  tune  it  to  the  transmission  minimum  of  the  line,  using  tuning  steps  of  ≤ 0.01 nm.  
Calibrate the instrument to the wavelength of this line (from Table 1) using the calibration procedure specified by the 
instrument  manufacturer.    The  instrument’s  linearity  can  be  checked  by  repeating  the  procedure  for  a  different 
absorption line and comparing it to the value listed in Table 1. 
 
Suggested Procedure for Moderate-Accuracy Requirements; Calibration Uncertainty in the Approximate Range 
of 0.01 nm to 0.1 nm:  Connect the light source (either broadband or narrowband, as discussed above) to one of the 
fiber connectors on the SRM unit using a single-mode optical fiber terminated with a clean FC/PC connector.  If the 
source  power  varies  significantly  with  wavelength,  divide  the  SRM  transmission  spectrum  by  the  source spectrum to 
obtain a normalized trace.  After identifying the absorption lines by comparing to the spectrum in Figure 1, make a high 
resolution  scan  of  a  line  listed  in  Table  1.    If  the  instrument  has  variable  resolution,  it  is  best  to  use  a  resolution  of 
≤ 0.1 nm with a data point density of at least one point every 0.005 nm. Find the wavelength readings on both sides of 
the  line  where  the  absorption  is  50  %  of  the  maximum;  the  line  center  is  half-way  between  these  two  wavelength 
readings.  Repeat this procedure five times and take the average of the five measurements for the line center.  Calibrate 
the  instrument  to  the  center  wavelength  of  this  line  (from  Table  1)  using  the  calibration  procedure  specified  by  the 
instrument  manufacturer.    The  instrument’s  linearity  can  be  checked  by  repeating  the  procedure  for  a  different 
absorption line and comparing it to the value listed in Table 1. 
 
Suggested Procedure for High-Accuracy Requirements; Calibration Uncertainty ≤ 0.01 nm:  [NOTE:  due 
to the presence of weak nearby lines and background slope, this SRM is not recommended for a calibration with 
an uncertainty of less than 0.001 nm.]  Connect the light source (either broadband or narrowband, as discussed 
above) to one of the fiber connectors on the SRM unit using a single-mode optical fiber terminated with a clean 
FC/PC connector.  Divide the SRM transmission spectrum by the source spectrum to obtain a normalized trace. 
After identifying the absorption lines by comparing to the spectrum in Figure 1, make a high resolution scan of a 

SRM 2519

line listed in Table 1.  If the instrument has variable resolution, it is best to use a resolution of ≤ 0.1 nm with a 
data  point  density  of  at  least  one  point  every  0.001 nm.    Using  a  fitting  technique  such  as  the  least  squares 
technique,  fit  the  absorption  data to the appropriate lineshape (Lorentzian if the line shape is dominated by the 
molecular absorption profile, Lorentzian convoluted with the instrument’s filter characteristics if the instrument 
contributes significantly to the profile).  Details of line fitting procedure and potential error sources can be found 
in reference 2.  Calibrate the instrument to the center wavelength of this line (from Table 1) using the calibration 
procedure specified by the instrument manufacturer.  The instrument’s linearity can be checked by repeating the 
procedure for a different absorption line and comparing it to the value listed in Table 1.
