Thermal Spray Powder – Particle Size Distribution 
Tungsten Carbide/Cobalt (Spheroidal) 

 
This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  use  in  the  calibration  of  equipment  used  to 
measure  particle  size  distributions (PSD)  in  the  18 m  to  55 m  range.    SRM 1985  consists  of  a  single  bottle 
containing approximately 14 g of tungsten carbide/cobalt powder.  
 
The  PSD  values  at  five  mass  percentiles  were  measured  by  scanning  electron  microscopy (SEM)  and  laser  light 
scattering (LLS).    A  comparison  of  the  SEM  and  LLS  results  are  shown  in  Figure 1.    An  example  of  an  SEM 
micrograph is included in Figure 2. 
 
 
Certified Values:  The certified PSD values by SEM are listed in Table 1.  These certified values were determined 
by  the  measurement  of over 11 000  individual  particles  from  three  bottles.   A  NIST  certified value  is  a  value  for 
which  NIST  has  the  highest  confidence  in  its  accuracy  in  that  all  known  or  suspected  sources  of  bias  have  been 
investigated or taken into account [1]. 
 
Reference  Values:    The  reference  PSD  values  by  LLS  are  listed  in  Table 2.    Reference  values  are  noncertified 
values that are estimates of the true value.  However, the values do not meet the NIST criteria for certification and 
are provided with associated uncertainties that may reflect only measurement precision, may not include all sources 
of uncertainty, or may reflect a lack of sufficient statistical agreement among multiple analytical methods [1]. 
 
 
Expiration of Certification:  This certification of SRM 1985 is valid, within the measurements uncertainty, until 
August 31 2020, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with instructions given in this certificate 
(see  “Instructions  for  Use”).    The  certification  is  nullified  if  the  SRM  is  damaged,  contaminated,  or  otherwise 
modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification.   
 
The concept for the development of this SRM was provided by S.J. Dapkunas of the NIST Ceramics Division.  The 
SRM measurement technique, development, and certification were performed by J.F. Kelly and P. Pei of the NIST 
Ceramics Division. 
 
Statistical analyses were performed by H-K. Liu of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division. 
 
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Measurement  Services 
Division.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 
 
Sample Dispersion and  Measurement Procedures  for Light Scattering Method:  Application of  the  reference 
values  produced  by  LLS  requires  following  this  sample  dispersion  procedure;  otherwise,  results  may  not  be 
comparable  to  the  reference  values  listed  in  Table 2.    NOTE:    Each  sample  bottle  contains  approximately  14 g 
tungsten carbide/cobalt powder which is sufficient for many analyses by LLS instruments.   
 
1.  Use  a  microriffler  for  splitting  the  sample  into  subsamples  of  the  appropriate  mass  as  specified  by  the 

manufacturer’s instructions. 

 
2.  Add 4 % aqueous sodium pyrophosphate solution to each subsample at the ratio of 1.00 mL/g per g of powder 
and make a paste by mixing gently with a spatula.  DO NOT use a magnetic stirrer since the powder will 
attach to the magnet and may be crushed during stirring. 

 
3.  Transfer the paste quantitatively (totally) into the measuring cell containing distilled water whose pH has been 
pre-adjusted  to  9.5  0.1  with  1  mol/L  sodium  hydroxide  solution.    Flush  the  container  with  pH-adjusted 
distilled water to complete the transfer. 

 
4.  Follow the instrument manufacturers’ instructions for instrument calibration and operation. 
 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Measurement  of  SRM:    The  starting  material  was  a  10 kg  batch  from  a  single  lot  (W1251A)  of  Type SA 201 
tungsten  carbide/cobalt  powder  obtained  from  OSRAM  Sylvania  Products,  Inc.,  Towanda, PA.    This  powder  was 
chosen  for  its  size  distribution,  spheroidal  particle  morphology  (Figure 2),  and  low  degree  of  fragility  and 
aggregation. 
 
The powder was split into bottle units containing approximately 14 g each by using spinning rifflers.  A randomized 
set of 100 bottles from 672 bottles was selected for homogeneity testing, round robin study using LLS instruments, 
and  certification  analyses  by  SEM.    Homogeneity  testing  of  11  randomly  selected  bottles,  measured  in  duplicate, 
was performed with a LLS instrument at NIST.  The data showed no evidence of size heterogeneity.  
 
Scanning  Electron  Microscopy  Analysis:    SEM  based  image  analysis  was  carried  out  on  three  bottles.    Sample 
preparation for microscopy entailed both a reduction in the mass of powder and a separation into size fractions.  The 
size  fractionation  is  accomplished  by  sieving  using  sieves  with  nominal  openings  of  10 µm,  20 m,  30 m,  and 
38 m.  Subsamples from each of the sieve splits were then produced by successive division using a spinning riffler.  
 
SEM images were acquired for each of the sieve fractions.  The backscatter electron images of the particles were 
acquired  as  grayscale  image  files  into  a  computer  via  a  digital  interface.    The  2048 × 2048  pixel  images  were 
analyzed to obtain the projected area of the tungsten carbide/cobalt particles.  These areas were fitted with ellipses 
and  the  major  and  minor  axes  converted  to  particle  volumes  (prolate  ellipsoids)  and  particle  diameters  using  the 
average  of  the  three  ellipsoid  axes.    The  pixel-to-length  conversion  was  calibrated  using  a  micrometer  slide 
calibrated at NIST using laser interferometry.  Several hundred particles of each sieve fraction were measured for a 
total of approximately 3500 particles measured from each bottle.  Particle size distributions describing the percent of 
powder mass represented by particles with diameters less than a given length were calculated using the weighting 
factors obtained from the sieving results.  The diameter values corresponding to the specific mass fractions of 10 %, 
25 %, 50 %, 75 %, and 90 % are listed in Table 1.  Current practice in the thermal spray industry is to specify these 
values to define the particle size distribution.  A graphical comparison of the distribution measured by SEM with the 
mean distribution obtained by LLS is shown in Figure 1. 
 
Laser Light Scattering Method (Round Robin Study):  Ten laboratories participated in this round robin study.  
Each round robin participant received two bottles for analysis using their light scattering instruments.  The reference 
distribution values given in Table 2 are based on 20 measurements by the 10 participating laboratories.  The LLS 
data from all 10 laboratories were obtained using such instruments as the Horiba LA910, Microtrac X100, Sympatec 
HELOS, and Beckman Coulter LS 230 following the sample preparation procedure specified by NIST.  Therefore, 

                                                           

(1)Certain  commercial  equipment,  instruments,  or  materials  are  identified  in  this  certificate  to  adequately  specify  the 
experimental  procedure.    Such  identification  does  not  imply  recommendation  or  endorsement  by  the  National  Institute  of 
Standards and Technology nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the 
purpose.

in the use of this SRM, the sample dispersion procedure is mandatory; otherwise, the data may not be comparable.  
Although the light scattering instruments produce a continuous plot of weight percent finer than a given diameter, 
five cumulative percentiles were selected as a representative data set for certification since it is consistent with the 
industrial practice.
