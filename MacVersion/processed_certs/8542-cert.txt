Report of Investigation 
 
Reference Material 8542 
IAEA—CH-6 Sucrose 
(Carbon Isotopes in Sucrose) 

 

 

 

 
This Reference Material (RM) is intended to provide a sample with a known isotope-amount ratio of carbon (C) in 
organic materials.  The equivalent name for this RM, as used by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the 
U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), is IAEA-CH-6 and is listed in column 2 of Table 1.  This material was also formerly 
named ANU Sucrose.  A unit of RM 8542 consists of one bottle containing approximately 1 g of sucrose.

(a)  The δ13C values are expressed as a mean  an expanded uncertainty.  The expanded uncertainty is 
equal to U = kuc, where uc is the combined standard uncertainty as defined by the ISO and NIST 
Guide [1]  and  k  is  the  coverage  factor.    The  value  of  the  consensus  mean  and  the  associated 
combined  standard  uncertainty  were  calculated  using  a  multivariate  Bayesian  approach [2].    The 
combined  standard  uncertainty  is  intended  to  represent,  at  the  level  of  one  standard  deviation,  the 
combined effects of Type A and B uncertainties on the reference value.  Uncertainty in the bias of the 
methods is not included.  The coverage factor k is 2 and provides an expanded uncertainty interval that 
has about a 95 % probability of encompassing the consensus mean. 

(b)  Normalized to δ13CVPDB of RM 8545 (L-SVEC) = –46.6 ‰. 

 
 
Expiration  of  Value  Assignment:    RM 8542  is  valid,  within  the  measurement  uncertainty  specified,  until 
31 December 2020, provided the RM is handled in accordance with instructions given in this Report of Investigation 
(see “Instructions for Use”).  The reference value is nullified if the RM is damaged, contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of RM:  NIST will monitor this RM over the period of its validity.  If substantive technical changes occur 
that affect the value assignment before the expiration of this report, NIST will notify the purchaser.  Registration (see 
attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
The technical aspects involved in the issuance of this RM were coordinated through the NIST Analytical Chemistry 
Division by R.D. Vocke, Jr. 
 
Reference  Difference  in  Isotope-Amount  Ratio  Values:    The  differences  in  measured  isotope-amount  
ratios 
values,  where  
δ13C = ([nsample(13C)/nsample(12C)]  – [nVPDB(13C)/nVPDB(12C)])/ [nVPDB(13C)/nVPDB(12C)].  VPDB refers to the Vienna PDB 
scale, which is determined by assigning a δ13C value of +1.95 ‰ to RM 8544 (NBS 19) [3].  The reported δ13C result for 
RM 8542 has been normalized to yield a consensus value of –46.6 ‰ for RM 8545.

The reference value for δ13C listed in Table 1 together with its expanded uncertainty are based on continuous flow 
elemental-analyzer isotope-ratio mass spectrometry [4] using the general method of Qi et al. [5].  Four expert laboratories 
(Centrum voor Isotopen Onderzoek, Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands; Max-Planck-Institute for 
Biogeochemistry, Jena, Germany; UFZ (Umweltforschungszentrum) Leipzig-Halle GmbH, Leipzig, Germany; U.S. 
Geological Survey, Reston, Va., USA) performed the analytical measurements and their results and the multivariate 
Bayesian approach for data reduction are described in detail in [2].  A reference value is a non-certified value that is the 
best estimate of the true value; however, the value may reflect only the measurement precision and may not include all 
sources of uncertainty. 
 
Support aspects involved in the issuance of this RM were coordinated through the NIST Measurement Services Division. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 
 
Distribution:  The distribution of RM 8542 (IAEA-CH-6) is limited to one unit per three-year period of time. 
 
Storage and Stability:  Sucrose is stable at normal room temperatures.  This RM should be stored in the container in 
which it is supplied to the user.
