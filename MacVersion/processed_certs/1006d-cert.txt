Standard Reference Material® 1006d



	Smoke Density Chamber Standard for NonFlaming Exposure Condition

		

This Standard Reference Material (SRM) consists of paper sheets, principally αcellulose, derived from wood chips.  The SRM is intended primarily for checking the operation of smoke density chambers under nonflaming exposure conditions in accordance with the prescribed calibration and standardization techniques outlined in the ASTM Method E 66295 [1] and NFPA 258 [2].  A unit of SRM 1006d consists of nine singlelayer sheets, each approximately 172 mm × 254 mm × 1.23 mm thick.



The certified value [3] and expanded uncertainty [4] for maximum specific optical density of a singlelayer thickness is:



	Dm	=  210  18 (without correction for window deposit)

	Dm corr.	=  193  20



Certified Values:  The certified values and uncertainties are the result of 30 tests on representative singlelayer thickness specimens of the SRM lot.  A certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [3].  A single sheet approximately 76.2 × mm × 76.2 mm × 1.23 mm thick was used for each test.  The series of 30 tests resulted in a mean maximum specific optical density, Dm, of 210 with a standard deviation of 8, when uncorrected for window deposit, and a mean corrected maximum specific optical density, Dm corr., of 193 with a standard deviation of 9.



The uncertainty analysis included component standard uncertainties for repeatability, chart recorder reading, pathlength, sample thickness, distance from heater to sample, photometric system, radiant flux, sample area, chamber volume, chamber temperature, and chamber pressure.  After estimating uncertainties by either Type A or B analysis, the uncertainties were combined in quadrature to yield the combined standard uncertainty.  Multiplying the combined standard uncertainty by a coverage factor of two results in the expanded uncertainty which corresponds to a 95 % confidence interval (2σ).  The total expanded uncertainties for Dm  and Dm corr. were 18 and 20, respectively.



Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 1006d is valid indefinitely, within the measurement uncertainty specified, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with instructions given in this certificate (see “Instructions for Handling, Storage, and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, or otherwise modified.



Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive technical changes occur that affect the certification of this SRM, before the expiration of the certificate, NIST will notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification.



Engineering testing and statistical analysis leading to the certification of this SRM were performed by N.P. Bryner, J. Lee, and R.L. Vettori of the NIST Fire Safety Engineering Division.



Support aspects involved in the issuance of this SRM were coordinated through the NIST Measurement Services Division.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE



This material degrades with exposure to humidity and light.  If exposure has occurred or is suspected, discontinue use.  Prior to use, the material must be dried for 24 h at 60 C and then conditioned to equilibrium at 23 C  3 C and 50 %  5 % relative humidity.  SRM 1006d is packaged in a resealable lightresistant bag, purged with nitrogen to protect against humidity and light.  Any unused sheets should be kept in the original packaging and should be stored in a cool, dry environment, or in a manner that assures protection against humidity and light.



SOURCE, PREPARATION, AND ANALYSIS



Tests of optical density were conducted in a commercially available smoke density chamber.  Smoke density measurements were made under non-flaming exposure conditions in accordance with the detailed procedures given in ASTM Standard E 66295 [1] and in NFPA Standard 258 [2].
