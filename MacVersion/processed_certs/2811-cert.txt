Rockwell C Scale Hardness – Mid Range 
 
Serial Number:  SAMPLE 
 
and  verification  of 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is a transfer standard intended for use in the calibration and verification of 
the  performance  of  Rockwell  hardness  equipment  using  the  Rockwell C  Hardness  Scale (HRC).    A  unit  of 
SRM 2811 is a steel test block, nominally 64 mm in diameter and 15 mm thick, having a polished test surface with a 
micro-engraved circle 52 mm in diameter.  Each SRM unit bears a unique serial number on the edge of the block. 
 
Certified  Hardness  Values:    This  SRM  is  certified  using  two  different  certification  modes:    (1) the  certified 
average hardness value over the entire test surface and (2) individually certified hardness values at specific untested 
locations on the test surface.  The certified average hardness value (Certification Mode 1) provides the user with a 
comparison  value  for  performing  indirect  verifications [1]  of  Rockwell  hardness  machines  for  the  HRC  scale.    In 
comparison  of  user  measurements  with  the  certified  average  hardness,  the  user  must  account  for  material 
non-uniformity as manifest at the measurement locations chosen by the user.  This non-uniformity is not included in 
the  uncertainty  for  Certification  Mode 1  given  in  this  certificate.    The  individually  certified  values  of  hardness  at 
specific untested locations (Certification Mode 2) provide a more complete characterization of the surface hardness 
of the block.  The Certification Mode 2, through the certified hardness values and their uncertainties, accounts for 
material non-uniformity over the surface of the block.   
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 2811 is valid indefinitely, within the uncertainty specified, 
provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  given  in  this  certificate  (see 
“Instructions for Handling, Storage, and Use”).  Accordingly, periodic recalibration or recertification of this SRM is 
not required.  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, or otherwise modified.

Certification Procedure:  Several test blocks were randomly selected from each production batch and covered with 
hardness indentations using the NIST standardizing hardness tester and diamond indenter.  The NIST standardizing 
hardness tester is a specially designed machine using directly loaded dead-weights for applying the required forces, 
and a laser interferometry displacement sensor for measuring the depth of indentation.  Hardness was measured by 
indentation tests in accordance with the Rockwell hardness principle [1] and following the test cycle given in this 
certificate. 
 
By  analyzing  the  hardness  profile  of  this  set  of  test  blocks,  information  on  material  uniformity  was  developed.  
NIST determined that the hardness varies across the surface of each block and varies differently from block to block.  
This hardness variation is due primarily to the nature of steel and the manufacturing process. 
 
The geometry of the NIST standardizing diamond indenter was verified using a stylus instrument [2].  The indenter 
measurements and expanded uncertainties (at a 95 % level of confidence) are 199.06 µm ± 1.97 µm for the tip radius 
and 120.00° ± 0.02° for the cone angle. 
 
Hardness measurements were then made at eight locations on the test surface of each SRM as illustrated in Figure 1.  The 
first  indentation,  labeled  “Seat”,  was  made  to  ensure  that  the  new  test  block  was  adequately  seated  on  the  anvil.  
“Seat” indentation data are potentially erroneous; thus, the resulting hardness value from this first indentation was 
discarded.  The seven hardness tests that followed, labeled 1 through 7, were used to determine the SRM certified 
hardness values for that SRM.

and “Seat” shown on the figure indicate the indentation sequence used in certification. 

 
Certification  Mode 1,  Certified  Average  Hardness  Value:    This  value  is  an  estimate  of  the  average  hardness 
across the test surface of the block.  Hardness varies slightly across the surface due to material non-uniformity and 
can  be  modeled  by  a  mathematical  function,  a  semivariogram  (see  “Discussion”).    The  average  hardness  value  is 
defined as that hardness function integrated over the test block surface divided by the surface area.

Uncertainty  of  the  Certified  Average  Hardness  Value:    The  expanded  uncertainty,  U,  in  the  certified  average 
hardness was calculated using U = kuc, where uc is the combined standard uncertainty calculated according to the 
JCGM  Guide [3],  and  k = 2  is  the  coverage  factor.    The  value  of  uc  represents  the  combined  effect  of  the 
individual sources of uncertainty listed in Table 1.  These sources include uncertainties due to deviations of the 
NIST  standardizing  hardness  tester  and  diamond  indenter  from  the  defined  requirements  for  the  Rockwell 
hardness test (forces, depth measurement, test cycle, and indenter shape) [1].  The value of uc is calculated as

The  expanded  uncertainty,  U,  provides  an  indication  of  the  accuracy  of  NIST’s  estimate  of  the  true  value  of  the 
average hardness of this SRM.  The uncertainty should not be interpreted as the range in expected hardness values 
that would be measured across the test surface, nor is it a limit of acceptable hardness values for verifying Rockwell 
hardness  equipment.    Similarly,  σ1,  σ2,  σ3,  and  σ4  are  uncertainty  components  that  contribute  to  the  overall 
uncertainty  in  the  certified  average  hardness  value  and  are  not  ranges  of  expected  hardness  results  due  to  each 
source of uncertainty.

Certification Mode 2, Individually Certified Hardness Values for Specific Locations:  This certification mode 
provides  the  user  with  individually  certified  hardness  values  at  11 untested  locations  on  the  SRM.    The  certified 
values at each location, defined in x, y coordinates and labeled with the letters A through K, are given in Table 2 and 
illustrated in Figure 2.

individually certified hardness values given in Table 2. 

 
Uncertainty of Individually Certified Hardness Values:  The uncertainties in the individually certified hardness 
values  for  the  locations  reported  in  Table 2  are  calculated  using  the  same  sources  of  uncertainty  as  used  for  the 
certified  average  hardness  values  given  in  Table 1.    A  difference  occurs  in  σ1,  the  uncertainty  component  due  to 
block uniformity and measurement repeatability.  The remaining uncertainty components σ2, σ3, and σ4 are the same 
for both types of hardness certification.  These four uncertainty components are given in Table 3 at a level of one 
standard deviation.  These components are combined to calculate the standard uncertainty, uc, to which the coverage 
factor k = 2 is applied to obtain the expanded uncertainty, U. 
 
For the individually certified hardness values, the expanded uncertainty, U, provides an indication of the accuracy of 
the best estimate of the true value of the hardness at that specific location on the SRM.  Similarly, σ1, σ2, σ3, and σ4 
are uncertainty components that contribute to the overall uncertainty in the certified hardness value at each specific 
location.

Discussion:    To  illustrate  the  effect  of  the  material  non-uniformity,  the  test  surface  of  the  SRM  block  should  be 
considered a collection of possible measurement locations.  The metal at each location will have a unique hardness 
value that differs slightly from the hardness value at any other location.  If it were possible to determine the hardness 
at every location, the collection of hardness values would be found to vary over a range, and an average hardness 
value  for  the  entire  test  surface  could  then  be  calculated.    The  extent  of  this  range  defines  the  non-uniformity  in 
hardness for the test surface.  The smaller the range in hardness values, the more uniform is the block.  Thus, for this 
SRM,  the  hardness  value  at  individual  locations  will  vary  over  a  range  that  extends  both  above  and  below  the 
average hardness value of the test surface. 
 
As a consequence of this hardness non-uniformity, a single certified hardness value does not completely describe the 
hardness  of  the  test  surface.    Thus,  two  types  of  hardness  certification  are  provided  in  this  certificate:    (1) the 
certified  average  hardness  (Certification  Mode 1)  and  (2) individually  certified  hardness  values  (Certification 
Mode 2)  at  untested  locations.    The  certifications  are  based  on  the  seven  NIST  hardness  measurements  and  on 
SRM 2811

modeling  hardness  as  a  random  function  across  the  test  surface.    These  two  types  of  certifications  define  the 
hardness of the test block in distinctly different ways.  The user must keep this in mind when using these certified 
values and the associated uncertainties. 
 
In general, the closer two measurements are made, the closer the hardness values will be to each other, limited by 
minimum  spacing  considerations  (see  “Indentation  Spacing”).    The  method  used  to  predict  hardness  values  at 
untested locations is based on a geostatistics formula [4] that models the hardness across the surface of a block as a 
random function described by a semivariogram.  The semivariogram is a mathematical model that describes how the 
measured hardness difference between any two test block locations relates to the physical spacing that separates the 
two locations.  In statistical terms, this semivariogram gives one half the variance of the hardness difference between 
any two locations on the test block.  Thus, the square root of twice the semivariogram is the standard deviation of 
this difference. 
 
For this SRM, the semivariogram is given by a simple function of Euclidean distance.  Consider two points, si and sj, 
separated by the distance, d (in mm), where

The  certified  average  hardness  value  is  based  on  the  seven  NIST  hardness  measurements  and  on  the  hardness 
prediction function discussed above.  This average value is defined as the hardness function integrated over the test 
block surface divided by the  surface area, and as such, is the average of the predicted hardness values  for all  test 
surface locations, and not the arithmetical average of the seven NIST measurements.  However, since the locations 
chosen  for  the  seven  NIST  measurements  provide  a  good  representation  of  the  surface,  the  certified  average 
hardness is close in value to the arithmetical average.  The NIST certified average hardness value is only somewhat

analogous to the certified value assigned to a commercially calibrated hardness test block that is typically calculated 
as the arithmetical average of several calibration measurements. 
 
This  certificate  also  provides  individually  certified  hardness  values  for  11 specific  untested  locations  on  the  test 
surface  of  the  SRM,  given  in  Table 2.    These  certified  hardness  values  and  their  associated  uncertainties  were 
calculated  using  a  mathematical  formula [4],  which  includes  the  semivariogram  given  above  and  the  three 
coefficients given in Table 4.  All that is required to perform these calculations are the values and locations for the 
seven NIST measurements given in Table 5, and the x, y coordinates of the locations for which hardness values are 
to be determined.  Using this same formula, additional certified hardness values at other untested locations may be 
calculated by the user [5,6].  The formulas may also be used for calculating various averages of the hardness at two 
or more arbitrary locations. 
 
2  to  the  HRC  scale  as 
Traceability:  This SRM can be used to demonstrate that a user’s measurements are traceable to the HRC scale as 
determined  by  NIST;  however,  the  procedures  required  to  demonstrate  traceability  are  varied  depending  on  the 
user’s needs.  In general, acceptable transfer of the NIST hardness values to the user can be accomplished in three 
ways:  (1) verification  within  tolerances - verifying  that  the  user’s  measurements  are  in  agreement  with  NIST 
certified  values  within  acceptable  tolerance  limits;  (2) verification  within  uncertainties - verifying  that  the  user’s 
measurements are in agreement with NIST certified values within the uncertainty ranges of the user’s and NIST’s 
measurements;  and  (3) calibration - calibration  of  the  performance  of  the  user’s  hardness  machine  to  the  NIST 
certified values by making appropriate mathematical corrections, and then verifying that the user’s corrected values 
are in agreement with NIST certified values within the uncertainties of the user’s and NIST’s measurements.  Each 
of  the  three  methods  requires  differing  levels  of  effort  by  the  user  to  determine  the  accuracy  in  his/her 
measurements. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
Handling:  This SRM is made of steel, and thus is susceptible to scratches, dents, and other mechanical damage, 
particularly on the top and bottom surfaces, as well as being susceptible to corrosion from moisture and reaction to 
skin oils.  The SRM is wrapped in corrosion-inhibiting paper and packaged in a protective wooden box.  The user 
should  wear  protective  gloves,  such  as  lint-free  cotton  or  powder-free  latex  gloves,  while  handling  the  SRM.    If 
gloves are not worn, skin oils should be removed by cleaning the SRM, see “Cleaning the SRM” below.  The SRM 
should be held only by the round edge to avoid excessive contact with the top and bottom surfaces. 
 
Storage:    When  not  in  use,  the  SRM  should  be  rewrapped  and  stored  in  the  original  box  or  in  a  manner  having 
equivalent  or  better  mechanical  and  corrosion  protection.    The  SRM  storage  area  should  be  maintained  at 
23 °C ± 2 °C (73 °F ± 5 °F) with a relative humidity of 50 % or less. 
 
Use:  The SRM is intended for use with all equipment capable of conducting an HRC indentation hardness test.  The 
HRC hardness test is defined as requiring the use of a Rockwell spheroconical diamond indenter and the following 
test  forces:    a  preliminary  force  of  98 N (10 kgf)  and  an  additional  test  force  of  1373 N (140 kgf)  that,  when 
combined  with  the  preliminary  force,  generates  the  total  test  force  of  1471 N (150 kgf).    The  Rockwell  hardness 
tester should be set up and operated in accordance with the recommendations of the manufacturer and as required by 
applicable test method standards.  All hardness measurements must be made within the circle engraved on the test 
surface of the SRM.  In order to perform calibration or verification measurements over the full usable range of the 
HRC  scale,  this  SRM  may  be  used  in  conjunction  with  SRM 2810  Rockwell C  Scale  Hardness - Low  Range  and 
SRM 2812 Rockwell C Scale Hardness - High Range. 
 
Test  Environment:    The  hardness  tester  to  be  calibrated  or  verified  should  be  stored  in  a  temperature  and 
humidity-controlled environment maintained at 23 °C ± 2 °C (73 °F ± 5 °F) and a relative humidity of 50 % or less 
and that the environment has been calibrated or verified to maintain those conditions.  The tester must also be in a 
location that is free from shock or vibration that could affect the hardness measurements. 
 
Anvil:  Use of a flat anvil is recommended (i.e., an anvil that can support the SRM for indentation anywhere on its 
test surface).  However, when calibrating or verifying a hardness tester, the same anvil must be used with the SRM 
that will be used on the tester after the calibration or verification. 
 
Cleaning the Anvil and Indenter:  The tester anvil and indenter diamond tip should be thoroughly cleaned using the 
recommendations  from  the  manufacturer.    In  the  absence  of  cleaning  instructions  from  the  manufacturer,  it  is 
recommended  that  the  anvil  and  indenter  be  cleaned  with  ethyl  alcohol  and  dried  using  a  lint-free  paper  towel  or 
cloth.  Then the surfaces should be blown clean of dust using filtered air, such as from a commercial compressed air 
can or bottle.  DO NOT blow clean by mouth.

Cleaning the SRM:  Prior to use, the SRM should be cleaned.  The SRM may be cleaned by gently wiping the top 
and bottom surfaces  with a clean cotton or a non-abrasive  cloth thoroughly  wetted  with  ethyl alcohol.  The  metal 
surfaces should immediately be dried using a soft lint-free paper towel or cloth before the alcohol evaporates.  There 
>  followed  by 
should  be  no  residue  remaining  on  the  top  and  bottom  surfaces.    The  alcohol  cleaning  should  be  followed  by 
blowing  the  surfaces  clean  of  dust  with  filtered  air.    The  top  and  bottom  surfaces  should  NOT  be  touched  after 
cleaning. 
 
Seating  the  Anvil  and  Indenter:    Prior  to  making  hardness  indentations  on  the  SRM,  the  tester  anvil  and  indenter 
must be seated.  This can be accomplished by performing Rockwell hardness tests on a material using the highest 
test force the tester is capable of applying.  The seating tests should be repeated until successive measurement values 
show no trend of increasing or decreasing hardness. 
 
Placement of the SRM on the Anvil:  Immediately before placing the SRM on the anvil, the top surface of the anvil 
and the bottom surface of the SRM should be cleaned as described above.  Once clean, the SRM should be placed 
immediately  on  the  anvil.    The  top  test  surface  of  the  SRM  should  be  blown  free  of  dust  prior  to  testing  and 
occasionally during use.  The SRM should be slid several times back and forth over the surface of the anvil to help 
seat the block on the anvil.   Any time the SRM  is  lifted from and replaced on the anvil, the procedure described 
above in this paragraph should be repeated. 
 
Preliminary Indentation:  When a flat anvil is used, at least one preliminary HRC test should be performed at any 
location on the test surface of the SRM.  The preliminary test will help seat the SRM on the anvil.  The measured 
hardness value of the preliminary test should not be used.  A preliminary indentation is not necessary when using a 
spot anvil. 
 
Indentation Location:  The user is cautioned not to make any indentation such that it contacts a previous indentation, 
the engraved circle, or the NIST logo; as doing so may damage the indenter.  No indentation should be made outside 
the engraved circle or on the bottom surface of the block. 
 
Indentation  Spacing:    Rockwell  hardness  measurements  may  be  influenced  by  nearby  previous  indentations.    For 
this  SRM,  a  hardness  measurement  will  not  be  measurably  affected  by  an  adjacent  Rockwell C  Scale  indentation 
that  is  located  at  a  distance  of  5 mm  or  greater,  center-to-center  spacing,  from  the  measurement  location.    It  is 
recommended  that  no  indentation  should  be  made  closer  than  3 mm,  center-to-center  spacing,  from  a  previous 
indentation.  For hardness measurements within 3 mm to 5 mm distance of only one single previous indentation, the 
resulting HRC value may be increased as much as 0.05 HRC.  Measurements made within 3 mm to 5 mm distance 
from  multiple  previously  made  indentations  will  produce  an  even  higher  elevation  in  HRC.    The  user  should 
consider  this  possible  elevation  of  hardness  when  making  measurements  on  this  SRM.    Table 6  lists  the  effect  of 
indentation-to-indentation  spacing for this SRM.  In addition to this indentation-to-indentation spacing restriction, 
no HRC measurement should be made within 1 mm of the engraved circle or the NIST logo.

Test Cycle:  This SRM unit has been certified by performing Rockwell C scale hardness tests using a specific test 
cycle.  The HRC test cycle may be characterized by specifying four test cycle parameters that have been determined 
to have a significant influence on the measurement results.  These parameters are defined as follows: 
 

Preliminary  Test  Force  Dwell  Time – the  time  period  beginning  when  the  preliminary  force  is  fully 
applied and ending when the first baseline measurement of indenter depth is taken. 
 
Total Force Dwell Time – the time period during which the total force is fully applied. 
 
Recovery Dwell Time – the time period beginning when the additional test force is fully removed returning 
the applied force to the preliminary force level and ending when the final measurement of indenter depth is 
taken. 
 
Additional Force Application Time – the time period during the application of the additional force.  This 
parameter may also be specified in terms of the indenter velocity during this time period. 
 

indenter 

To minimize the uncertainty in the hardness measurement, a test cycle should be used that replicates, as closely as 
possible, the SRM certification test cycle parameters.  Deviations from the SRM test cycle in dwell times or force 
application rate will result in measured hardness values that deviate from measurements from the certified values. 
 
The test cycle parameters used for the certification of this SRM are given in Table 7 and illustrated in Figure 3.
