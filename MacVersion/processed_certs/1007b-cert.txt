Standard Reference Material 1007b 

 

 
Smoke Density Chamber Standard 
 
Flaming Exposure Condition  
 
This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  recommended  for  checking  the  operation  of  the  Smoke-Density 
Chamber  under  flaming  exposure  conditions  by  implementing  the  prescribed  calibration  and  ASTM  test 
procedures [1].    SRM 1007b  consists  of  three  nominal  254 mm × 254 mm (10 in × 10 in)  sheets  of  (acrylonitrile-
butadiene-styrene copolymer) plastic having a nominal thickness of 0.762 mm (0.030 in) from which the user can 
cut twenty-seven (nine from each sheet) 3-inch square specimens for testing. 
 
The  certified  value  for  maximum  specific  corrected  optical  density  Dm (corr.)  and  Standard  Error  Uncertainty  is 
given by: 

Dm (corr.)  =  (20 743  ×  t)  –  214    34 
 

where, t is the specimen thickness in inches. 
 
The slope and intercept are based on a best-fit straight line derived from the maximum optical density observed in 
31 tests that were made on representative specimens cut from the plastic sheets that comprise SRM 1007b.  These 
measurements were made under flaming exposure conditions in accordance with the detailed NFPA procedures [2].  
The maximum specific optical densities were corrected for the deposit of solid soot particles on the glass window by 
subtracting the “clear beam” value, Dc, which was 21  4.  The uncertainty of the certified value is the standard error 
of  the  best-fit  straight  line  correlating,  Dm (corr.)  with  specimen  thickness  and  includes  contributions  from  curve 
fitting, specimen thickness and smoke density measurements. 
 
The following table gives certified values for a series of thicknesses based on the above formula. 
 

Table 1.  Certified Values for SRM 1007b 
 
Thickness (mm) 
0.737 
0.762 
0.787 
0.813 
0.838 
0.864 
0.889 

Dm (corr.) 
388 
408 
429 
450 
471

512 

The equation expressed in mm is:  Dm (corr.)  =  (816.66  ×  t)  –  214 

where t is the specimen thickness in mm. 
 
Expiration  of  Certification:    The  certification  of  SRM 1007b  is  valid  indefinitely,  within  the  measurement 
uncertainty  specified,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  instructions  given  in  this 
certificate (see “Instructions for Handling, Storage, and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, 
contaminated, or otherwise modified.

Maintenance  of  SRM  Certification:    NIST  will  monitor  this  SRM  over  the  period  of  its  certification.    If 
substantive  technical  changes  occur  that affect  the  certification before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST will 
notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
Engineering  tests  leading  to  the  certification  of  this  Standard  Reference  Material  were  performed  by  R.L. Vettori 
and  J.R. Lawson  of  the  Center  for  Fire  Research,  using  a  commercially  available  Smoke-Density  Chamber.  
Subsequent testing of SRM 1007b was performed between July and October 2008 at three fire testing laboratories at 
the  direction  of  M.R. Nyden  of  the  Fire  Research  Division.    The  results  obtained  in  these  subsequent  tests  were 
consistent with the certified values listed in the table above. 
 
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Measurement  Services 
Division. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
This  material  should  be  protected  from  exposure  to  direct  sunlight  and  must  be  conditioned  to  equilibrium  at 
23 ºC   3 ºC and 50 %  5 % relative humidity prior to testing.  The plastic sheets that comprise SRM 1007b are not 
uniform in thickness.  Measurements have indicated that the thickness varies over the area of a single sheet and with 
conditioning time.  To account for the effect of these variations on the specific optical density measurements, each 
3 inch × 3 inch  (76.2 mm × 76.2 mm)  specimen  should  be  measured  by  a  micrometer  to  within  0.0005 inch 
(0.013 mm) immediately before each test.
