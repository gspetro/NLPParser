Standard Reference Material  1893 
 
Copper Microhardness Test Block (Knoop) 
 
Lot # 09 
 
Serial No.  SAMPLE 

 
This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  intended  for  use  as  a  primary  standard  in  calibrating  Knoop-type 
microhardness testers and is  certified for  mean Knoop hardness  values at loads of  0.245 N, 0.490 N, and 0.980 N 
(0.025 kgf,  0.050 kgf,  and  0.100 kgf,  respectively).    A  unit  of  SRM 1893  consists  of  a  square  test  block  of 
electrodeposited bright  copper on an  AISI 1010 steel  substrate.  The test block  measures 1.35 cm on each side, is 
approximately 1.5 mm thick, and is mounted in a thermosetting epoxy.  Five indentations were made on the SRM’s 
polished  surface  for  each  load  at  positions  illustrated  in  Figure 1.    The  mean  Knoop  hardness  value  and  the 
corresponding expanded uncertainty for the mean of the five indentations made for each load tested are presented in 
Table 1.  Knoop hardness values are reported as Knoop hardness numbers (HK) in units kgf/mm2 and in SI units of 
gigapascals (GPa).   Each  SRM  was individually  measured and bears a  serial  number imprinted on the side of the 
epoxy mount.

Expiration  of  Certification:    The  certification  of  SRM 1893  is  valid  indefinitely,  within  the  measurement 
uncertainty specified, provided the SRM  is  handled, stored, and used  in accordance  with the  instructions  given  in 
this  certificate  (see  “Instructions  for  Handling,  Storage,  and  Use”).    Accordingly,  periodic  recalibration  or 
recertification of this SRM is not required.  Aside from indentation, any physical damage or other alteration of the 
surface of the specimen, including all processes that remove surface material such as repolishing, will invalidate the 
certification. 
 
Maintenance  of  SRM  Certification:    NIST  will  monitor  this  SRM  over  the  period  of  its  certification.    If 
substantive technical  changes occur that affect the certification, NIST will notify the purchaser.  Registration (see 
attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
The coordination of the production and the technical measurements leading to the certification of SRM 1893 were 
performed by D.R. Kelley of the Thin Film and Nanostructure Processing Group of the NIST Metallurgy Division. 
 
Statistical analysis of the data was performed by N.F. Zhang of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division. 
 
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Measurement  Services 
Division.

NIST  Specimen  Preparation:    The  starting  material  for  this  SRM  was  a  flat  sheet  of  electroformed  copper, 
23 cm × 46 cm × 2 mm, over a steel substrate.  The  copper sheet/steel substrate combination was cut into coupons 
that  were mounted and highly polished  to provide flat and  parallel surfaces suitable  for Knoop  microindentations.  
After polishing, the 0.1 μm layer of gold was electroplated over the coper to prevent corrosion.  Finally, the samples 
were indented and the Knoop hardness measured. 
 
Certification Procedure:  The Knoop microindentations are located in the center and near the four corners of the 
block as illustrated in Figure 1.  These indentations were made in accordance with the Knoop hardness test principle, 
in  which  a  diamond  indenter,  in  the  form  of  a  rhombic-based  pyramid,  is  forced  into  the  surface  of  a  test  piece 
followed by measurement of the long diagonal length of the indentation left in the surface after removal of the test 
force.  The full test force was applied for 12.5 seconds with one set of five indentations made for each load.  The 
certified mean HK of this block at three different loads are given in Table 1. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) of all 
data collected led to the treatment of load and position as statistically significant factors. 
 
Hardness values for this SRM were obtained using a dedicated, calibrated hardness tester.  The loading mechanism 
of  the  hardness  tester  was  calibrated  with  a  miniature  precision  load  cell  that  was  calibrated  with  NIST-certified 
weights.  The indentation sizes were measured on an optical microscope using a filar micrometer and/or an image 
analyzer calibrated with a NIST-certified stage micrometer.  When using the 10 X filar micrometer for measuring 
the  indentation  size,  the  total  magnification  was  1000 X  using  a  100 X  dry  objective  lens  with  a  numerical 
aperture (NA)  of  0.90.    For  measurement  with  the  image  analyzer,  the  microscope  100 X  dry  objective  lens  was 
used with a 1 X video camera lens. 
 
The HK is obtained by dividing the applied force to the indenter by the projected area of the permanent indentation 
made by the diamond indenter.  The value is computed from the following equation (taking into consideration the 
Knoop indenter geometry shown in Figure 2):

Where  A and  B are the included angles for the indenter as shown in Figure 2 above, P is the applied force to the 
indenter,  and  d  is  the  length  of  the  long  diagonal  of  the  indentation.    For  the  ideal  indenter,  A = 172°30' 
and  B = 130°0', thus, transforming Equation 1 into:

Since the units of gram-force (gf) and micrometers (µm) are normally used in this field, the constant in Equation 2 
can be modified to accommodate the conversion factors to ease use during computation.  The equation for  Knoop

Discussion of Uncertainty:  The uncertainty in the average certified value of the  Knoop hardness measurement is 
expressed as an expanded uncertainty, U, at the 95 % level of confidence, and is calculated according to the method 
described  in  the  ISO Guide [1].    The  expanded  uncertainty  is  calculated  as  U = kuc,  where  uc  represents  the 
combined  effect  of  the  individual  sources  of  uncertainty  listed  in  Table  2  and  k = 2  is  the  coverage  factor.  
These  sources  include  uncertainties  due  to  deviations  of  the  NIST  standardizing  tester  and  indenter  from  the 
defined requirements for the hardness test (force, diagonal measurement, test cycle, and indenter shape).  The 
value  of  uc  is  individually  calculated  for  each  SRM  unit  and  load.    The  expanded  uncertainty,  U,  provides  an 
indication  of  the  precision  of  NIST’s  estimate  of  the  true  value  of  the  average  hardness  of  this  SRM.    The 
uncertainty should not be interpreted as the range in expected hardness values that would be measured across the test 
surface,  nor  is  it  a  limit  of  acceptable  hardness  values  for  verifying  the  hardness  equipment.    Similarly,  the 
uncertainty components listed in Table 2 contribute to the overall uncertainty in the certified average hardness value.  
These are not ranges of expected hardness results due to each source of uncertainty.

For each load, one indentation is made at each of the five positions shown in Figure 1.  The long diagonal of each 
indentation  is  measured  three  times.    The  average  value  for  the  diagonal  length  and  the  corresponding  standard 
deviation are listed as information values in Table 3.  The average of the 15 hardness values calculated using each 
diagonal length is used as the certified hardness value.  The standard deviation for the average of the measurements 
, where s is the sample standard deviation.  
of the five indents is calculated as the Type A uncertainty given by 
1bu with  its  sources 
For the Type B uncertainty, two components are considered.  The first component  is denoted 
,  is  due  to  indenter  bias.    The  bias  error  is  considered  to  have  a

INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE  
 
The  metallic  block  is  durable  but  may  be  susceptible  to  tarnish  or  corrosion  in  an  environment  of  high  humidity 
and/or acidic sulfur or chlorine-bearing gases or liquids.  Oils, fingerprints, or skin oils should be removed from the 
SRM before and after use.  The SRM unit may be cleaned with ethyl alcohol and soft wipe materials.  The surface 
polish should be protected from abuse.  The blocks must  NEVER BE REPOLISHED, as this will invalidate the 
certification. 
 
This SRM is intended for use with microhardness testing machines whereby a Knoop indentation can be made and 
then measured with an optical microscope.  When using this SRM, a minimum of five indentations must be made 
for comparison to the certified mean Knoop hardness value and expanded uncertainty. 
 
When making new indentations in the block, special care should be taken to ensure that the loading rates and load 
duration are as prescribed by the applicable Knoop hardness test method standard.  There should be no vibrations or 
impact imparted to the machine during the indentation cycle.  The surface of the test block and the indenter must be 
clean  and  should  not  contain  skin  oils,  which  could  alter  the  friction  between  the  indenter  and  block  surface.  
Indentations may be placed in any region of polished surface provided that they are not within 1.9 mm of any edge, 
since  slight  edge  rounding  from  polishing  can  distort  the  indentation  shape  and  affect  the  size.    Guidelines  for 
indentation spacing can be found in applicable Knoop hardness test method standards. 
 
When measuring indentations, proper illumination and focus of the indentation tips are critical to obtain good clarity 
and contrast.  The apparent indentation size will be affected by the magnification used since the numerical aperture 
of the objective lens establishes the resolution limits. 
 
Magnifications should be checked by use of a calibrated stage micrometer.  FSilar micrometers and image analyzing 
systems should be calibrated with stage micrometers.  Proper use of filar crosshairs is essential.  For best results, it is 
critical that the instructions of the hardness machine manufacturer and the applicable Knoop hardness test method 
standard be followed.  Additional information on the preparation of this SRM can be found in references 2 and 3.
