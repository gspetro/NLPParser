Ignitable Liquids Test Mixture

of  chromatographic 
This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  use  in  the  calibration  of  chromatographic 
instrumentation used for the classification of an ignitable liquid residue.  SRM 2285 is a solution of 15 compounds, 
including even carbon number aliphatic hydrocarbons from hexane to tetracosane, toluene, p-xylene, 2-ethyltoluene, 
3-ethyltoluene,  and  1,2,4-trimethylbenzene  in  methylene  chloride.    A  unit  of  SRM 2285  consists  of  five  2 mL 
ampoules, each containing approximately 1.2 mL of solution. 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values:  The certified values for the 15 constituents are given in Table 1.  These values 
are  based  on  results  obtained  from  the  gravimetric  preparation  of  this  solution  and  from  the  analytical  results 
determined  by  using  gas  chromatography.    A  NIST  certified  value  is  a  value  for  which  NIST  has  the  highest 
confidence in its accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of uncertainty have been investigated or taken into 
account [1]. 
 
Information Concentration Values:  Information values for concentrations, expressed as percent volume fractions, 
are provided in Table 2 for the components.  An information value is considered to be a value that will be of interest 
and  use  to  the  SRM  user,  but  insufficient  information  is  available  to  assess  adequately  the  uncertainty  associated 
with the value or only a limited number of analyses were performed [1]. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 2285 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until  30 March 2023,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  given  in  this 
certificate (see “Instructions for Handling, Storage, and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, 
contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance  of  SRM  Certification:    NIST  will  monitor  this  SRM  over  the  period  of  its  certification.    If 
substantive  technical changes occur that affect the certification before the expiration of this certificate, NIST  will 
notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
Overall  direction  and  coordination  of  technical  measurements  leading  to  certification  were  performed  by 
M.M. Schantz and S.A. Wise of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division. 
 
Preparation  and  analytical  measurements  of  the  SRM  were  performed  by  J.V. Goodpaster,  B.J. Porter,  and 
M.M. Schantz of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division. 
 
Consultation  on  the  statistical  design  of  the  experimental  work  and  evaluation  of  the  data  were  provided  by 
S.D. Leigh of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division. 
 
Partial funding support for the preparation and certification of this Standard Reference Material was provided by the 
National Institute of Justice (NIJ) and managed through the NIST Office of Law Enforcement Standards (OLES). 
 
Office  of  Reference
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Office  of  Reference 
Materials.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 

Handling:  This  material contains alkane and aromatic compounds and should be handled  with care.  Use proper 
disposal methods, see material safety data sheet. 
 
Storage:  Sealed ampoules, as received, should be stored in the dark at temperatures lower than 30 °C. 
 
Use:  Sample aliquots for analysis should be withdrawn at 20 °C to 25 °C immediately after opening the ampoules 
and should be processed without delay for the certified values in Table 1 to be valid within the stated uncertainty.  
Because  of  the  volatility  of  methylene  chloride,  certified values  are  not  applicable  to material  stored  in  ampoules 
that have been opened for more than 2 minutes, even if they are resealed. 
 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS(1) 

130 

The  compounds  used  in  the  preparation  of  this  SRM  were  obtained  from  Aldrich  (Milwaukee, WI),  EM  Science 
(Gibbstown, NJ), Mallinckrodt (Phillipsburg, NJ), and JT Baker (Phillipsburg, NJ).  The weighed components were 
added  to  the  methylene  chloride  and  mixed  until  completely  dissolved  and  homogenized.    The  total  mass  of  this 
solution  was  measured,  and  the  mass  fractions  were  calculated  from  this  gravimetric  procedure.    These  mass 
fractions  were  adjusted  for  the  purity  estimation  of  each  component,  which  was  determined  using  gas 
chromatography  with  flame  ionization  detection  (GC-FID)  on  two  stationary  phases  of  different  polarities  and 
differential scanning calorimetry.  The bulk solution was then chilled to approximately –5 °C, and 1.2 mL aliquots 
were dispensed into 2 mL amber glass ampoules, which were then flame sealed. 
 
Aliquots  from  nine  ampoules,  selected  using  a  random  stratified  sampling  scheme,  were  analyzed  in  duplicate  by 
using GC-FID with two stationary phases of different polarities.  The internal standard n-heptadecane was added to 
each  sample  for  quantification  purposes.    Calibration  solutions  consisting  of  weighed  amounts  of  the  compounds 
(adjusted  for  the  purity  estimation)  and  the  internal  standard  compound  in  methylene  chloride  were 
chromatographically  analyzed  to  determine  analyte  response  factors.    A  representative  chromatogram  from  the 
GC-FID analysis on each stationary phase is shown in Figure 1. 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values:  The results are expressed as the certified value ± the expanded uncertainty.  The 
certified  value  is  the  unweighted  average  of  the  mass  fractions  determined  by  gravimetry  and  chromatographic 
measurements.  The expanded 95 % uncertainty uses a coverage factor, k, of 2 and incorporates both correction for 
estimated  purity  and  allowance  for  differences  between  the  mass  fractions  determined  by  gravimetric  preparation 
and  chromatographic  measurements [2].    The  Chemical  Abstract  Service (CAS)  Registry  Numbers  are  given  in 
Table 1.
