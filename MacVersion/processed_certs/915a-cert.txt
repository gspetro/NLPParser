Standard  Reference  Material  915a 

Calcium  Carbonate 

(Clinical  Standard) 

It  is  intended  primarily  for  use 
This  Standard  Reference  Material  (SRM)  is  certified  as  a  chemical  of  known  purity. 
in  the  calibration  and  standardization  of  procedures  for  calcium  determinations  employed  in  clinical  analysis  and  for 
routine  critical  evaluation  of  the  daily  working  standards  used  in  these  procedures.  It  may  be  used  to  prepare  calcium 
standard  solutions  for  either  atomic  absorption  or  titrimetric  methods  of  analysis.  The  SRM  consists  of  highly  purified 
calcium  carbonate  in  a  20-g  unit. 

‘See  Table  2,  Summary  of  Uncertainties;  and  Table  3,  Components  of  Uncertainty 

Certified  Purity:  99.965  +  0.015°  Wt  % 

The  certified  value  is  calculated  from  the  results  of  independent  coulometric  assays  as  described  below. 
The 
uncertainty  interval  represents  the  expanded  uncertainty,  U,  calculated  according  to  the  ISO  Guide  [1]  as  twice  the 

”  combined  standard  uncertainty  and  gives  the  95%  level  of  confidence  for  the  certified  value. 

Coulometric  Assay:  The  assay  value  for  this  material  was  obtained  by  automated  coulometric  back-titration  [2],  to 
a  strong  acid  endpoint  (pH  7),  of  weighed  CaCO,  samples  after  addition  of  excess  coulometrically  standardized  HCl 
and  elimination  of  the  product  CO,.  The  certified  value  represents  the  result  of  six  such  titrations  of  samples  from 
three  randomly  selected  bottles  from  the  entire  lot  of  SRM  915a. 

Expiration  of  Certification:  This  certification  will  be  valid  for  five  years  from  the  date  of  shipment  from  NIST. 
Periodic  reanalysis  of  representative  samples  from  this  SRM  lot  will  be  performed,  and  if  significant  changes  are 
observed  within  the  five-year  period,  the  purchaser  will  be  notified  by  NIST.  Please  return  the  attached  registration 
card  to  facilitate  notification. 

Coulometric  analyses  were  performed  in  the  NIST  Analytical  Chemistry  Division  by  K.W.  Pratt. 

The  technical  and  support  aspects  involved  in  the  preparation,  certification,  and  issuance  of  this  SRM  were 
coordinated  through  the  Standard  Reference  Materials  Program  by  J.C.  Colbert.

The  original  trace  element  analyses  on  this  lot  of  material  (included  in  the  Supplemental  Information  section)  were 
performed  in  the  NIST  Analytical  Chemistry  Division  (formerly  the  Inorganic  Analytical  Research  Division  )  by 
T.C.  Rains,  T.A.  Rush,  V.C.  Stewart,  and  D.W.  Vomhof  (all  retired). 

NOTICE  AND  WARNINGS  TO  USERS 

This  Standard  Reference  Material  is  intended  for  "in  vitro"  diagnostic  use  only. 

Stability  and  Storage:  This  SRM  should  be  stored  in  its  original  bottle  at  room  temperature.  It  must  be  tightly  re- 
capped  after  use  and  protected  from  moisture  and  light. 

Homogeneity:  This  SRM  was  homogeneous  within  the  uncertainty  limits  for  the  280-mg  sample  size  used  for  the 
coulometric  assays.  Samples  less  than  250  mg  are  not  recommended  in  order  to  avoid  possible  inhomogeneities  with 
smaller  sample  sizes. 

INSTRUCTIONS  FOR  USE 

Standard  Stock  Solutions  of  Calcium  for  Reference  Method  for  Atomic  Absorption  Spectrophotometry  [3]: 
Using  class  A  volumetric  flasks,  prepare  three  stock  solutions  using  the  quantities  given  in  Table  1.  Add  the  specified 
initial  volume  of  water  before  adding  the  specified  volume  of  concentrated  HCl.  After  all  the  SRM  915a  is  dissolved, 
add  the  specified  amounts  NaCl  and  KCl,  dilute  with  water  up  to  the  neck,  and  invert  until  the  salts  are  totally 
The  pipettings 
dissolved.  Then  dilute  each  solution  to  the  calibrated  volume  and  mix  by  inverting  the  flask  30  times. 
and  dilutions  of  these  standard  stock  solutions  follow  the  same  instructions  as  given  in  reference  [3].

Drying  Instructions:  To  achieve  the  certified  value,  this  material  should  be  dried  at  200-210  °C  for  4h. 

Stock  Solution  of  Calcium  for  Titrimetric  Procedure:  Place  0.2503  ¢  of  dried  SRM  915a  into  a  1-L  volumetric 
flask.  Add  approximately  9  mL  of  deionized  water  and  1  mL  concentrated  (12  mol/L;  37%)  HCl.  Make  sure 
that  all  the  calcium  carbonate  is  in  solution  before  diluting  with  water  up  to  the  neck.  When  at  ambient 
temperature,  dilute  to  the  calibrated  volume  and  mix  by  inverting  the  flask  30  times. 
glass  bottle. 

This  solution  contains  10.0  mg  Ca’*  per  100  mL  or  5.00  meq/L. 

Store  in  a  borosilicate 

Stability  of  Prepared  Solutions:  Solutions  prepared  from  SRM  915a,  Calcium  Carbonate,  are  stable  indefinitely 
when  stored  in  a  glass-stoppered  bottle,  excepting  concentration  changes  due  to  evaporation  during  sampling.  All 
such  solutions  should  be  clear  and  display  no  turbidity. 

 

Source  of  Material:  The  calcium  carbonate  used  for  this  SRM  was  obtained  from  the  J.T.  Baker  Chemical  Co., 
Phillipsburg,  NJ. 

The  material  was  examined  for  compliance  with  the  American  Chemical  Society  [4]  specification  for  reagent 
grade  calcium  carbonate.  The  material  was  found  to  meet  or  exceed  the  minimum  requirements  in  every  respect. 
Examination  by  thermal  gravimetric  analysis  indicated  a  minute  loss  of  weight  below  175  °C  (volatile  matter). 
The  composition  was  stable  above  175  °C  to  a  temperature  of  625  °C,  above  which  material  decomposition 
(evolution  of  CO,)  began  to  occur. 

SUPPLEMENTAL  INFORMATION 

A  semi-quantitative  survey  for  trace  contaminants  by  emission  spectrometry  indicated  the  presence  of  less  than 
0.001  wt  %  of  copper,  iron,  magnesium,  manganese,  and  silicon  in  the  material. 
magnesium  was  evaluated  at  1.0,  sodium  at  0.4,  and  strontium  at  2.1  ug/g;  potassium  was  less  than  0.4,  lithium 
less  than  0.05,  and  barium  much  less  than  10  g/g.  Neutron  activation  analysis  indicated  copper  at  0.9, 
manganese  at  0.6,  and  sodium  at  0.5  ng/g.  Copper  was  determined  at  1  ug/g  by  spectrophotometry.
