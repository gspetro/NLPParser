Standard Reference Material 1573a 
Tomato Leaves 
CERTIFICATE OF ANALYSIS 

Purpose:  This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended primarily for use in validating analytical methods for 
the  determination  of  major, minor, and trace elements in botanical materials, agricultural food products, and similar 
materials.  This SRM can be used for quality assurance when assigning values to in-house control materials.   
 
Description:  A unit of SRM 1573a consists of 50 grams of dried tomato leaves. 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values:  Certified mass fraction values are provided in Table 1.  A NIST certified value is 
a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias have 
been taken into account [1].

(a) Values are expressed as x ± U95%(x), where x is the certified value and U95%(x) is the expanded uncertainty of the certified value.  
The  true  value  of  the  analyte  is  believed  to  lie  within  the  interval  x ±  U95%(x)  with  95 %  confidence.    To  propagate  this 
uncertainty, treat the certified value as a normally distributed random variable with mean x and standard deviation U95%(x)/2.  
NIST methods used for certification can be found in Table A1.   

 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 1573a is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until  01 August 2027,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  given  in  this 
certificate (see “Instructions for Storage and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, 
or otherwise modified.

Non-Certified  Values:    Table 2  provides  estimated  values  for  additional  measurands  that  do  not  meet  the  NIST 
criteria  for  certification  and  are  provided  as  additional  information  on  the  composition  of  the  material.    A  NIST 
information value is a value that may be of interest to the SRM user, but insufficient information is available to assess 
the uncertainty associated with the value, and therefore no uncertainty is provided [1].

Storage and Handling:  The SRM should be stored in the dark, at controlled room temperature (20 °C to 25 °C), in 
tion. 
its original unopened bottle, until required for use.  The SRM should not be exposed to intense sources of radiation.  
The bottle can be resealed and test portions removed and analyzed until the material reaches its expiration date.   
 
Use:  The contents of the bottle should be thoroughly mixed by rotating and/or rolling the bottle before each use.  Allow 
the  contents  to  settle  for  one minute  prior  to  opening  to  minimize  the  loss  of  fine  particles.    To  relate  analytical 
determinations to the certified values in this certificate, the test portion mass indicated in the description of the NIST 
analyses for each group of analytes (see “Source, Preparation, and Analysis” below) should be used.  Test portions 
should be taken by gently tapping material needed from the SRM bottle.  Results in this certificate are reported on a 
dry-mass  basis;  sample(s)  need  to  be  dried  using  one  of  the  recommended  techniques  (see  “Determination  of 
Moisture”) to compare results to certified values found in this certificate.  Results obtained in analyses should include 
their  own  estimates  of  uncertainty  and  can  be  compared  to  the  certified  values  using  procedures  described  in 
reference [3].   
 
Determination  of  Moisture:    Moisture  content  of  SRM 1573a  was  determined  at  NIST  by  (1) drying  over  fresh 
anhydrous magnesium perchlorate in a desiccator at room temperature for 120 h (the sample depth should not exceed 
1 cm) and (2) freeze drying for 24 h at a pressure of 13.3 Pa or lower and a shelf temperature of –5 °C or lower after 
having frozen the sample (not to exceed 1 cm in depth) at –40 °C or lower for at least 1 h.  At the end of the 24-h period, 
samples were placed immediately in a desiccator with fresh anhydrous magnesium perchlorate.  Samples were weighed 
after allowing a minimum of 4 h to establish temperature equilibrium.  It is preferable to analyze volatile elements such 
as mercury from the bottle without drying, determine the moisture content on a separate sample from the same bottle, 
and correct the analytical results to a dry-mass basis.   
 
losses 
Vacuum drying at room temperature and oven drying at elevated temperatures have resulted in excessive mass losses 
NOT 
and therefore are NOT recommended.   
 
Safety:  SRM 1573a is intended for research use; not for human consumption. 
 
Source:  The material for this SRM is leaves selected from “Count II” tomato plants grown in three lime and fertilizer 
experiments covering about three acres at the Horticultural Research Farm (Rock Springs, PA).  Mature leaves were 
collected and prepared (Plant Analysis Laboratory, The Pennsylvania State University (University Park, PA)).  The 
leaves were selected from guard plants which had not received any treatment in order to obtain as uniform a material 
as possible.  Twenty-four batches, or three tons, of leaves were collected.  Fungicide sprays were avoided to prevent 
contamination  of  the  leaves.    After  each  collection,  the  leaves  were  transported  to  the  Plant  Analysis  Laboratory, 
washed, dipped in a detergent solution, rinsed with tap water, then triple rinsed with distilled water.  The leaves were

drained and placed in pasteboard trays for oven drying at a temperature of 60 °C to 70 °C.  The leaves were passed 
through a 40-mesh screen in a Wiley Mill.  Representative samples were taken from each batch for analysis before 
mixing batches together.  At NIST, the ground leaves were jet milled and air classified to a particle size of approximately 
75 μm (200 mesh).  Prior to bottling, the material was irradiated by 60Co to an estimated minimum absorbed dose of 
25 kGy for microbial control.

Homogeneity  Assessment:    Samples  from  fifteen  randomly  selected  bottles  of  SRM 1573a  were  tested  for 
homogeneity by INAA.  No evidence of statistically significant inhomogeneity was observed. 
 
Value  Assignment:    Calculation  of  assigned  values  are  based  on  results  from  a  single  definitive  method  or  on 
weighted means of multiple assessments of the mass fraction of each element made using different chemical methods 
or in different laboratories.  Weighted means were calculated using the DerSimonian-Laird procedure [4-6], which 
weights the results from each method in proportion to the inverse of the square of its uncertainty.  The weights include 
uncertainty contributions from both between- and within-method dispersion of values. The associated uncertainties 
are expressed at an approximately 95 % level of confidence [7-8].   
 
Analytical  Approach  for  Determination  of  Elements:    Value  assignment  of  the  mass  fractions  of  elements  in 
SRM 1573a was based on measurements provided by NIST and collaborating laboratories, where appropriate.  NIST 
provided  measurements  by  using  colorimetry,  cold-vapor  atomic  absorption  spectrometry  (CVAAS),  flame  atomic 
emission  spectrometry  (FAES);  hydride  generation  atomic  absorption  spectrometry  (HAAS),    inductively  coupled 
plasma  optical  emission  spectrometry  (ICP-OES),  isotope  dilution  inductively  coupled  plasma  mass  spectrometry 
(ID ICP-MS),  isotope  dilution  thermal  ionization  mass  spectrometry  (ID TIMS),  instrumental  neutron  activation 
analysis (INAA),  Kjeldahl nitrogen determination (KJEL), laser-excited atomic fluorescence spectrometry (LEAFS), 
neutron-capture prompt gamma-ray activation analysis (PGAA), and radiochemical neutron activation analysis (RNAA).  
Quantification was based on the SRM 3100 series single element standard solutions. 
 
NIST  Analyses  for  P  by  Colorimetry:   Duplicate,  nominal  0.15 g  test  portions  were  taken  from  six  bottles  of 
SRM 1573a.  Samples were placed in Teflon beakers using a HNO3/HF/HClO4 acid mixture.  Solutions were heated 
to  near  dryness  and  transferred  to  100 mL  volumetric  flasks  with  dilute  HCl.    A  colorimetric  reagent  (2.5  molar 
H2SO4/antimony  potassium  tartrate/ammonium  molybdate/0.1  molar  ascorbic  acid)  was  added  to  each  sample 
dilution.  The absorbance of each solution was read on a Cary spectrophotometer at 650 nm in a 1-cm cell with a slit 
width of 0.2 mm.  Quantification was based on the method of standard additions.  
 
NIST  Analyses  for  Hg  by  CVAAS:   Duplicate,  nominal  2 g  test  portions  were  taken  from  three  bottles  of 
SRM 1573a.   Samples  were  digested  under  reflux  conditions  using  HNO3/HClO4/H2SO4.    Samples  were  analyzed 
using a FIAS-200 flow injection system and a Perkin Elmer 2380 or 5000 AAS.   Quantification for the above analyses 
was based on a five-point calibration curve. 
 
NIST Analyses for Na by FAES:   Duplicate, nominal 1 g test portions  were taken  from six bottles of SRM 1573a.  
Samples  were  digested  overnight  under  reflux  conditions  using  a  HNO3/HF/HClO4  acid  mixture.    Solutions  were 
heated to near dryness and transferred to 100 mL volumetric flasks with 1% HNO3.  Quantification was based on the 
method of standard additions.   
 
NIST  Analyses  for  As  and  Se  by  HAAS:  Duplicate,  nominal  1 g  test  portions  were  taken  from  three  bottles  of 
SRM 1573a.  Samples were digested under reflux conditions using a HNO3/HClO4/H2SO4 acid mixture until fumes 
of H2SO4 appeared.  Samples were cooled and 2 mL of HCl were added, solutions were heated for 15 min at near 
boiling then transferred to 100 mL volumetric flasks.  For determination of As, a solution of 10 % KI and 5 % ascorbic 
acid was added to each sample and allowed to stand for 1 h to reduce As.  For determination of Se, a solution of 
10 % HCl and 0.5 % sodium borohydride was used as a reducing agent.   
 
NIST Analyses for Al, Cu, Fe, P, and Zn by ICP-OES:  Duplicate, nominal 1 g test portions were taken from six bottles 
of SRM 1573a.  Samples were placed in Teflon beakers and wet ashed with a HNO3/HF/HClO4 acid mixture.  When 
dissolved, samples were evaporated and diluted to 100 mL in 1.5 % HNO3.  Quantification was based on the method 
of standard additions.  
 
NIST Analyses for B, Cd, and Ni, by ID ICP-MS:  Duplicate, nominal 1.0 g test portions were taken from each of six 
bottles of SRM 1573a.  For cadmium and nickel samples were spiked with isotopically enriched 111Cd, 62Ni, then wet 
ashed with a HNO3/HF/HClO4 acid mixture in Teflon beakers.  The digests were re-dissolved in NH4COOCH3 and 
placed on either an anion or cation exchange column to selectively remove the elements of interest.  For boron, samples 
were  spiked  with  isotopically  enriched  10B  and  then  dissolved  in  quartz  flasks  with  reflux  condensers  using  a 
HNO3/H2O2 mixture.  The digests were evaporated to approximately 5 mL and neutralized with NH4OH to a final 
concentration of 2% NH4OH.  The isotopic ratios were measured by ICP-MS using standard operating conditions. The 
10B  spike,  SRM 952  Enriched  Boric  Acid  Standard,  SRM 951  Boric  Acid  Isotopic  Standard,  and  metals  of  known 
purity were used for calibration.

NIST Analyses for Ca, K, Rb, and V by ID TIMS:  Single, nominal 0.5 or 1.0 g test portions were taken from each of 
six bottles of SRM 1573a.  Samples were spiked with isotopically enriched 42Ca, 41K, 87Rb and 50V then wet ashed 
with  a  HNO3/HF/HClO4  acid  mixture  in  Teflon  beakers.        The  digests  were  placed  on  either  an  anion  or  cation 
exchange column to selectively remove the elements of interest.  Thermal ionization was performed using a triple 
filament procedure and internal normalization of measured ratios. 
 
NIST Analyses for Al, Ba, Ca, Co, Cr, Fe, K, Mn, Na, Rb, Sb, Se, V and Zn by INAA: Duplicate, nominal 0.15 g test 
portions were taken from each of six bottles of SRM 1573a.  All samples, controls and standards were pressed into 
cylindrical pellets and packaged individually in clean polyethylene bags. For determination of antimony, chromium, 
cobalt, iron, rubidium, selenium, and zinc, samples were irradiated for 8 h and radioactive decay was counted for up 
to 24 h after a decay of 20 d.  For determination of aluminum, barium, calcium, manganese, potassium, sodium, and 
vanadium, samples were irradiated for 40 s.  For barium, manganese, potassium and sodium, radioactive decay was 
counted for 60 min after a decay of 40 min.  For calcium, radioactive decay was counted for 10 min after a decay of 
10 min.  For aluminum and vanadium, radioactive decay was counted for 6 min after a decay of 2 min. 
 
NIST  Analyses  for  N  by  KJEL:  Single,  nominal  2 g  test  portions  were  taken  from  fifteen  bottles  of 
SRM 1573a.  Sample preparation was based on the AOAC method 2.057, Improved method for Nitrate-Free Samples, 
14th edition. 
 
NIST  Analyses  for  Mn  by  LEAFS:  Duplicate,  nominal  1 g  test  portions  were  taken  from  six  bottles  of 
SRM 1573a. Samples were ashed with a HNO3/HF/HClO4 acid mixture in Teflon beakers, refluxed overnight, then 
evaporated to near dryness.  Samples were diluted to 400 mL with 1 % HNO3.  Resonance fluorescence measurements 
were made with both excitation and fluorescence wavelengths at the 279.482 nm wavelength.  Quantification was by 
the method of standard additions.  
 
2ach  of  six  bottles  of
NIST  Analyses  for  B,  Cd,  K,  and  N  by  PGAA:  Single  1 g  test  portions  were  taken  from  each  of  six  bottles  of 
SRM 1573a.  Each sample was pressed into a cylindrical pellet and irradiated for 13 h.  Standards used were ACS 
grade borax, a standard solution of boric acid, a set of pure nitrogen compounds, and a standardized set of solutions 
of the metals.  Spectral peaks were integrated by two analysts and corrections were made for flux, dead time, pulse 
pileup, background, and interference peaks. 
 

NIST Analyses for As, Cd, Cu, Sb, and Se by RNAA: Duplicate, nominal 0.25 g test portions were taken from each of 
six bottles of SRM 1573a.  Disks were formed from each aliquot, encapsulated into polyethylene bags, and irradiated 
for 3 h at 15 MW.  After several days, samples were placed in Teflon beakers with a HNO3/HF/HClO4 acid mixture. 
Samples were heated, the acid reduced and samples brought up to volume in 1 M HNO3 and samples were passed 
through a column before counting.
