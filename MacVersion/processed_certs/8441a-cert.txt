Reference Material 8441a 
 
Wheat Hardness 
 
(kernel form) 

 
This Reference Material (RM) is intended primarily for use in calibrating instruments used for the determination of 
hardness  of  single-kernel  wheat.    RM 8441a  was  prepared  and  analyzed  by  the  Federal  Grain  Inspection 
Service (FGIS)  program,  Grain  Inspection  Packers  and  Stockyards  Administration (GIPSA)  of  the  United  States 
Department of Agriculture (USDA).  The USDA is the sole authority for all of the information provided in this report, 
including reference values and other technical information.  A unit of RM 8441a consists of fifty pouches, five pouches 
each of five hard wheats and five soft wheats.  Each pouch contains 20 g of material. 
 
Reference  Concentration Values:    Reference  values  for  hardness  are  provided  in Table 1.    Reference  values  are 
noncertified values that are the best estimate of the true values based on available data; however, the values do not 
meet  NIST  criteria  for  certification [1]  and  are  provided  with  associated  uncertainties  that  may  reflect  only 
measurement reproducibility and may not include all sources of uncertainty.  
 
Expiration  of  Value  Assignment:    RM 8441a  is  valid,  within  the  measurement  uncertainty  specified,  until 
03 January 2022, provided the RM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given in this report (see 
or  otherwise 
“Instructions  for  Storage  and  Use”).    This  report  is  nullified  if  the  RM  is  damaged,  contaminated,  or  otherwise 
modified. 
 
Maintenance of RM:  The FGIS will monitor representative samples from each of the lots of wheat comprising this 
RM.  If substantive technical changes occur that affect the value assignment before the expiration of this report, NIST 
will notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Technical aspects involved in the preparation and issuance of this RM were coordinated by K.E. Sharpless of the NIST 
Special Programs Office.  
 
RM 8441a was characterized by the USDA FGIS.  The cleaning, dividing, packaging, and characterization of each 
wheat sample were performed at the FGIS under the direction of A.C. Johnson. 
 
Statistical consultation was provided by J. Yen of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division.  
 
Office  of  Reference  Materials.
Support aspects involved in the issuance of this RM were coordinated through the NIST Office of Reference Materials. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE AND USE 
 
This RM, in unopened pouches, should be stored at 2 °C to 5 °C.  Each pouch should be allowed to warm to room 
temperature (23 °C ± 2 °C) immediately before use.

WARNING TO USERS 
 
RM 8441A IS INTENDED FOR RESEARCH USE; NOT FOR HUMAN OR ANIMAL CONSUMPTION. 
 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Sources and Preparation of Materials:  A set of wheat samples was designated by FGIS in 1996 as wheat hardness 
reference samples (WHRS).  This set of samples is made up of 10 separate lots of wheat (three pure varieties of hard 
red winter, two pure varieties of hard red spring, two pure varieties of soft red winter, and three pure varieties of soft 
white wheat) purchased from commercial sources.  All lots were cleaned with a Carter-Day dockage tester and split 
into 15.9 kg (35 lb) sub lots using a Gamet rotator divider.  The samples were stored in 19-liter (5 gallon) pails that 
were sealed with lids and stored at 2 °C to 5 °C.  A sub lot of each of the WHRS was taken from storage and split 
into  20-gram  portions  using  a  Boerner  divider  and  these  sub  samples  were  packaged  in  barrier-film  aluminized 
pouches.  Such sub lots were used to prepare RM 8441, which was issued in 1997, and RM 8441a, issued in 2004. 
 
Single-Kernel Reference Values and Uncertainties:  RM 8441 and RM 8441a were prepared as transfer standards 
for  linking  the  measurements  of  Single-Kernel  Characterization  System (SKCS)  4100 instruments  to  the  National 
FGIS wheat hardness reference scale.  The single-kernel hardness values assigned to the WHRS are the grand averages 
of the hardness values that were found for these samples using 13 single-kernel characterization system instruments 
(SKCS 4100).  The SKCS instruments were calibrated to give a mean hardness reading of 72.6 for the five hard WHRS 
and they were calibrated to give a mean hardness of 31.2 for the five soft WHRS.  Each WHRS was measured in each 
of the 13 SKCS instruments in triplicate.  The standard deviation of the 13 instruments’ mean hardness values for a 
particular WHRS was taken as the uncertainty in the hardness values assigned to that WHRS (Table 1). 
 
The hardness values reported in this document for RM 8441a are the hardness values that were assigned to the WHRS 
samples in 1996 (issued in 1997).  To verify that the single-kernel hardness values of the WHRS had not changed in 
RM 8441a,  single-kernel  SKCS  4100  hardness  measurements  were  made  on  ten  sets  of  RM 8441a.    The  SKCS 
instrument was sloped and biased such that the mean of the hardness results for the hard RM 8441a was 72.6 and the 
mean of the hardness results for the soft RM 8441a was 31.2.  Ten sets of three replicates of each of the 10 RM 8441a 
wheats were tested for hardness values. 
 
The grand average of the means of the hardness values for the single-kernel SKCS 4100 hardness measurements for 
a particular RM 8441a material was calculated.  The single-kernel hardness values found for RM 8441a were within 
the acceptance limits (i.e., the value found deviated from the assigned value by less than three times the uncertainty 
values listed in Table 1) of the corresponding hardness values that were assigned to those samples in 1996.  Therefore, 
the single-kernel hardness values that are assigned to the RM 8441a material in this document (Table 1) are values 
that were originally assigned to these samples in 1996. 
 
The wheat hardness values listed in Table 1 are the values that the user should obtain using an SKCS 4100 instrument 
that has been sloped and biased to RM 8441a, following the instructions in the SKCS 4100 Operation Manual [3], 
such that the mean of the hardness values measured for the five hard RM wheats (MH1 to MH5) is 72.6 and the mean 
of the hardness scores measured for the five soft RM wheats (MS1 to MS5) is 31.2.  On a properly sloped and biased 
SKCS 4100  instrument,  the  hardness  value  measured  for  each  wheat  should  be  within  three  times  the  uncertainty 
values  (3 × uc)  listed  in  Table 1.    If  RM 8441a  is  used  for  standardizing  instruments  other  than  SKCS 4100 
instruments, the hardness values measured may be different from the values listed in Table 1.

Computation Procedure for the Standardization of SKCS 4100 Instruments Using RM 8441a. 
 
The process by which the mean of the hardness values measured for the five hard RM 8441a wheats is adjusted to the 
fixed value, HB, and the mean of the hardness values measured for the five soft RM 8441a wheats is adjusted to the 
fixed value, SB is called standardization.  For single-kernel hardness measurements, HB and SB are fixed at 72.6 and 
31.2, respectively.  
 
Let  MH1,  MH2,  MH3,  MH4,  and  MH5  be  the  means  of  the  hardness  values  for  two  or  more  hardness  measurements 
performed on Hard 1, Hard 2, Hard 3, Hard 4, and Hard 5 RM wheats, respectively, and let MS1, MS2, MS3, MS4, and 
MS5 be the means of the hardness values for two or more hardness measurements performed on Soft 1, Soft 2, Soft 3, 
Soft 4, and Soft 5 RM wheats, respectively. 
 
Then 
 
and 
 
An SKCS 4100 instrument is standardized to RM 8441a if MH = HB and MS = HS.  If MH ≠ HB and/or MS ≠ HS, then the 
hardness values measured for the RM using this instrument are sloped and biased such that MH = HB and MS = HS. 
 
The  following  relationship  holds  true  for  HB,  SB,  MH,  and  MS:    HB = a + (b × MH)  and  SB = a + (b × MS),  where, 
a and b are the bias and slope factors used to adjust the measured hardness values to the appropriate fixed values. 
 
The slope factors can be computed as follows:  b  =  (HB − SB) ÷ (MH − MS). 
 
The bias factor can be computed from:  a  =  HB − (b × MH) or a  =  SB − (b × MS). 
 
Therefore, the standard hardness value (SHV) for each wheat can be determined using the following relationship: 
SHV = a + (b × old HV) where old HV is the hardness measured for RM 8441a. 
 
Example:  Suppose that the SKCS 4100 yielded the hardness values listed in Table A1 for RM 8441a. 
 

MS  =  (MS1  +  MS2  +  MS3  +  MS4  +  MS5)  ÷  5.
