Certificate of Analysis 
Standard Reference Material 1934 

Fluorescent Dyes for Quantitative Flow Cytometry 
(Visible Spectral Range) 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is  intended  for  use  in  assigning fluorescence intensity values to calibration 
standards for quantitative flow cytometry in the visible spectral range.    A unit of SRM 1934  consists  of  four amber  
ampoules,  each  containing  2 mL  of  a  different  fluorophore  solution  or  suspension. 
  The  solutions  include 
Part A: Fluorescein  Solution (60 μM  aqueous  borate  buffer  solution);  Part B:  Nile  Red  Solution  (60 μM  acetonitrile 
solution);  Part C:  Coumarin 30  Solution  (acetonitrile  solution);  and  Part D:  APC  Suspension  (Allophycocyanin 
fluorescent protein in aqueous buffer solution, 100 µL). 
 
This  reference  scale  for  fluorescence intensity  is  based  upon  Equivalent  Reference  Fluorophore (ERF)  units [1–2].  
The ERF scale is established for a particular set of experimental conditions by measuring the fluorescence intensity of 
known concentrations of each ampoule under those experimental conditions (see “Instructions for Handling, Storage, 
and Use”).  
 
Certified  Co n ce nt ra t io n  Values:   The  certified  f l u o r o p h o r e  concentration and purity values for Parts A, B, and 
A,B,  and
C listed in Tables 1A, 2A, and 3A respectively, are provided based  on  gravimetric  preparation  and analysis of purity by 
proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.  A  NIST  certified  value  is  a value  for  which  NIST has  the  highest 
confidence in its accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [3]. 
 
Reference  Values:    A  reference  value  for  the  allophycocyanin (APC)  suspension  concentration  for  Part D  is 
provided in Table 4A.  The reference values for the molar extinction coefficients are provided for each solution corrected 
for purity and based on gravimetric preparation and analysis of the absorbance of visible light at the peak wavelength.  A 
NIST reference value is a noncertified value, which represents the best estimate of the true value based on available data; 
however, the value does not meet the NIST criteria for certification and is provided with associated uncertainties that may 
reflect only measurement precision, may not include all sources of uncertainty, or may reflect a lack of sufficient statistical 
agreement among multiple analytical methods [3]. 
 
Information Values:  Information values are given for pH, buffer concentration and mass density for Parts A and D, and 
for mass density for the solvents used in Parts B and C; corrected fluorescence emission spectrum of Parts A through D 
at their recommended excitation wavelength; and APC purity for Part D.  A NIST information value is a value that may 
be of use to the SRM user, but insufficient information is available to assess adequately the uncertainty associated with 
the value [3].  An information value cannot be used to establish metrological traceability. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 1934 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, until 
01 July 2021,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  instructions  given  in  this  certificate  (see 
“Instructions for Handling, Storage, and Use”).  This certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, or 
otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical changes occur that affect the certification before the expiration of this certificate, NIST will notify the purchaser.  
Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate this notification. 
 
Production  and  certification  of  this  SRM  were  performed  by  P.C. DeRose,  L. Wang,  A.K. Gaigalas,  K.D. Cole, 
A .   U r b a s ,   B. Coxon,  G.W. Kramer  of  the  NIST  Biosystems  and  Biomaterials  Division;  with  assistance  from

Statistical consultation was provided by B. Toman and J. Lu of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division. 
 
Ancillary  measurements  were  provided  by  G.E. Marti,  F. Abbasi,  and  J. Weaver  of  the  U.S. Food  and  Drug 
Administration, R.F. Vogt of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Y-z. Zhang of Molecular Probes, Inc. 
 
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Office  of  Reference 
Materials. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
Handling:   This SRM is comprised of a suspension in a plastic ampoule (Part D) and three solutions (Parts A-C), each 
contained in a tip-sealed glass ampoule with pre-scored stem.  Therefore, all appropriate safety precautions, including the 
use of gloves during handling, should be taken to avoid accidental breakage or spillage.   
 
Storage:  Unopened ampoules should be stored in the dark between 2 °C and 6 °C in an upright position.  The ampoules 
should NOT be frozen because of the possibility of breakage during freezing and thawing.  Once the ampoule is opened, 
the solution should be used promptly with minimal exposure to any light (exposure to incandescent lighting is preferable 
to illumination from daylight or fluorescent lighting).  Any unused solution in the ampoule should be discarded according 
to local regulations. 
 
NOTICE:    NIST  monitored  the  stability  of  SRM 1934.    Prior  to  certification,  SRM 1934  parts  were  monitored  as 
follows:  Part A for over 24 months, Part B and Part C for five months, and Part D for approximately 9 months.   Within 
the  error  of  the  measurements,  the  absorbance  spectrum  and  the  fluorescence  spectral  radiance (as  indicated  by  the 
fluorescence signal spectrum) of the solution did not change.   Therefore, the ampouled solution, if  stored  as indicated 
above, is likely to maintain its original optical properties for the duration of its certification period. 
 
Opening  an  Ampoule:   When  an  ampoule  is  opened,  that  area  of  the  stem  where  the  pre-scored  band  is  located 
should be wiped with a clean, damp cloth and the body of the ampoule wrapped in absorbent material.   Then holding the 
ampoule  steady  and  with  the  thumb  and  forefinger  grasping  the  stem  above  the  scoring, minimal thumb pressure 
should be applied to the stem to snap it.    Correctly done, the stem should break easily where pre-scored.  The use of a 
metal file to break the stem is NOT recommended.

Source of Material:  The fluorescein [2-(6-hydroxy-3-oxo-3H-xanthen-9-yl)benzoic acid, C20H12O5, relative molecular 
mass 332.311, CAS No. 2321-07-5] powder used in SRM 1934 was prepared especially for this purpose by  Molecular 
Probes, Inc.  (Eugene, OR;  Leiden, The  Netherlands),  71358,  MPR,  Lot W018073.   Boric  acid granules  were obtained 
from  Mallinckrodt  (St.  Louis, MO),  Lot 2549 KVTK,  relative  molecular  mass 61.83.  Sodium  hydroxide pellets were 
from  Mallinckrodt,  Catalog No. 7708, Lot 7708M484721, relative  molecular mass 40.00.   All  water  used  was  NIST 
deionized  water  that  was  then  subsequently  passed  through  a  second purification system (Millipore Mill-Q A10) to 
produce water having a resistivity ≥18 MΩ·cm. 
 
Preparation of Part A:  The borate buffer solution was prepared by dissolving 18.56 g of boric acid granules in slightly 
less than 3 L of water.  The pH was adjusted to above 9.1 using 40 mL of an approximately 3.0 mol/L NaOH solution 
made by dissolving 29.87 g of sodium hydroxide pellets in 0.250 L of water.  The mixture volume was increased to 3.00 L 
with water to give a borate buffer with a boric acid concentration of about 0.10 mol/L. 
 
The  SRM  solution  was  prepared  in  a  darkened  room  by  dissolving  0.05636 g ± 0.00004 g  of  fluorescein  (buoyancy 
corrected) in 2.7134 kg ± 0.0006 kg of borate buffer solution (buoyancy corrected).   The mass of fluorescein used was 
corrected for the fluorescein purity yielding a final fluorescein concentration of 60.97 μmol/ kg ± 0.40 μmol/kg.  The 
fluorescein solution contained in an amber  bottle was immediately aliquotted into ampoules that were  subsequently 
flame-sealed.  The  pH  and  mass  density  of  the  SRM  were determined from measurements on four ampoules selected 
randomly from the lot. 
 
Preparation of Part A for Analysis:  The SRM 1934 Part A solution should always be diluted gravimetrically at least 
one-hundred  fold  with  the  same  buffer system used for the analyte of interest.   Subsequent gravimetric dilutions can 
then be employed to generate a calibration curve.  The calibration curve describes the relationship between fluorescence 
intensity, as determined by the fluorometer and the concentration of fluorescein, as determined by the gravimetric dilution.  
Care must be taken in  making  the  gravimetric  dilutions  because  uncertainties  expand  during  this  serial  process.   An 
error  at  one  level adversely affects determinations at all subsequent levels.  The calibration curve measurements should 
be generated starting with the lowest concentration.   For best results, the conditions used for determining the calibration 
curve such as solution degassing, temperature, ionic strength, pH, etc., should closely match those used in the measurement 
of the analyte.   Because fluorescence is a highly sensitive technique, great attention must be paid to the cleanliness of 
glassware and any other apparatus that contacts the solutions.   Many plastics and gloves can contaminate samples with 
small amounts of highly fluorescent materials such as release agents and plasticizers.  The running of blanks to check for 
such contamination is highly recommended. 
 
Depending on the solution pH, aqueous fluorescein solutions are complex, rapidly equilibrating mixtures of its several 
forms (cation, neutral species, monoanion, and dianion).   Each species has unique absorbance and fluorescence spectra.  
Above pH 9, aqueous fluorescein exists almost exclusively as the highly fluorescent dianion.  However, as the pH of the 
solution  is  reduced,  the  concentration  of  the  dianion  decreases,  and  the  concentrations  of  the  much  less  fluorescent 
monoanion and neutral forms increase [4].  Accordingly, the sensitivity of the fluorometric assay  for  fluorescein  also 
decreases,  and  quantitation  becomes  very  dependent  on  knowing  or  maintaining  the precise  pH  of  the  solutions 
during  calibration  as  well as  during  the  assay  itself.   While  the  calibration  strategy described above can work with 
solutions below pH 9, the uncertainties of such measurements inevitably grow larger as the solution pH is lowered. 
 
Assignment  of  Uncertainties:  Standard  uncertainty  components  equivalent  to  the  estimated  standard  deviation were 
assigned  for  sample  inhomogeneity  and  measurement  uncertainties.    These  values  were  then  combined  with  balance 
accuracy and estimated instrument method uncertainties using the root-sum-of-squares method.  An expansion factor of 
k = 2 was applied so that the expanded uncertainties given in this certificate express an interval within  which  the  true 
value  is  expected  to  fall  with  a  level  of  confidence  of  approximately  95 %  for  a  normal distribution [5].

Figure 2.  Corrected fluorescence emission spectrum for SRM 1934 Part B, diluted 100 fold using ACN, at an excitation wavelength 
of 488 nm.  A 488 nm diode laser was used for excitation.  The spectral bandpass of the detection system was set at 2.5 nm. 
 
Source of Material:  The Nile Red (NR) (9-diethylamino-5-benzo[α]phenoxazinone, C20H18N2O2, relative molecular 
mass 318.369, CAS No. 7385-67-3) was produced by Molecular Probes® (Life Technologies/Thermo Fisher Scientific) 
as Cat. # N1142, Lot # 1189983, and determined by the manufacturer to be 99 % pure using HPLC with UV absorption 
detection  at  254 nm.    Dye  solutions  were  dissolved  in  acetonitrile (ACN)  and  concentrations  were  determined 
gravimetrically.  The ACN used was Mallinckrodt UltimAR®, (HPLC/Spectrphotometric grade) Lot # H454 T37465. The 
balance  used  was  a  Mettler AT20,  which  was  internally  calibrated.  All  gravimetric  measurements  were  taken  at 
temperature T = 21.0 °C, 25 % relative humidity (rh) and 995 mbar atmospheric pressure. 
 
Preparation  of  Part  B:    The  SRM  solution  was  prepared  by  dissolving  0.030039 g ± 0.000005 g  of  Nile  Red  in 
776.7 g ± 0.2 g of ACN.  The certified Nile Red concentration was corrected for the mass of air displaced by the dye and 
ACN during weighing and the purity of the Nile Red, yielding a value of 118.7 μmol/kg ± 2.3 μmol/kg.  The  Nile Red 
solution contained in an amber  bottle was aliquotted into ampoules that were  subsequently  flame-sealed.  
 
Preparation of Part B for Analysis:  The SRM 1934 Part B  solution  should  always be diluted  gravimetrically  at least 
one-hundred  fold  with  ACN.   Subsequent gravimetric dilutions can then be employed to generate a calibration curve.  
The calibration curve describes the relationship between fluorescence intensity, as determined by the fluorometer and the 
concentration of Nile Red, as determined by the gravimetric dilution.   Care must be taken in  making  the  gravimetric 
dilutions because uncertainties expand during this serial process.   An error at one level adversely affects determinations 
at all subsequent levels.  The calibration curve measurements should be generated starting with the lowest concentration.  
For  best  results,  the  conditions  used  for  determining  the  calibration  curve  should  closely  match  those  used  in  the 
measurement of the analyte.   Because fluorescence is a highly sensitive technique, great attention must be paid to the 
cleanliness of glassware and any other apparatus that contacts the solutions.   Many plastics and gloves can contaminate 
samples with small amounts of highly fluorescent materials such as release agents and plasticizers.  The running of blanks 
to check for such contamination is highly recommended. 
 
Assignment  of  Uncertainties:  A standard  uncertainty  component  equivalent  to  the  estimated  standard  deviation was 
assigned for sample inhomogeneity.  This value was then combined with gravimetric and purity uncertainties using the 
root-sum-of-squares method.  An expansion factor of k = 2 was applied so that the expanded uncertainties given in this 
certificate  express  an  interval  within  which  the  true  value  is  expected  to  fall  with  a  level  of  confidence  of 
approximately  95 %  for  a  normal distribution [5].  The upper limit of the bias due to evaporation of solvent during 
ampouling was also estimated and added to the expanded uncertainty.

Figure 3.  Corrected fluorescence emission spectrum for SRM 1934 Part C, diluted 100 fold using IPA, at an excitation wavelength of 
405 nm.  A 405 nm diode laser was used for excitation.  The spectral bandpass of the detection system was set at 2.5 nm. 
 
Source  of  Material:    The  C30  [3-(2-N-methylbenzimidazolyl)-7-N,N-diethylaminocoumarin,  C21H21N3O2,  relative 
molecular mass 347.410, CAS No. 41044-12-6], also known as Coumarin 515, was produced by Aldrich (Sigma-Aldrich) 
as Cat. # 546127, Lot # BCBH1078V, and determined by  the  manufacturer to be 99 % pure  with  unspecified analysis 
techniques.   Dye solutions  were dissolved in acetonitrile (ACN) and concentrations  were determined gravimetrically.  
The ACN used was Mallinckrodt UltimAR®, (HPLC/Spectrphotometric grade) Lot # H454 T37465.  The balance used 
was  a  Mettler  AT20,  which  was  internally  calibrated.    All  gravimetric  measurements  were  taken  at  temperature 
T = 21.0 °C, 25 % relative humidity (rh), and 995 mbar atmospheric pressure. 
 
Preparation  of  Part C:    The  SRM  solution  was  prepared  by  dissolving  0.036239 g ± 0.000006 g  of  C30  in 
778.0 g ± 0.2 g of ACN.  The certified C30 concentration was corrected for the mass of air displaced by the dye and ACN 
during  weighing  and  the  purity  of  the  C30,  yielding  a  value  of  130.5 μmol/kg ± 1.7 μmol/kg.  The  C30  solution, 
contained in an amber  bottle, was aliquotted into ampoules that were  subsequently  flame-sealed.  
 
Preparation of Part C for Analysis:  The SRM 1934 Part C solution should always be diluted gravimetrically at least 
one-hundred  fold  with  isopropanol.   Subsequent gravimetric dilutions can then be employed to generate a calibration 
curve.  The calibration curve describes the relationship between fluorescence intensity, as determined by the fluorometer 
and the concentration of C30, as determined by the gravimetric dilution.  Care must be taken in  making  the gravimetric 
dilutions because uncertainties expand during this serial process.    An error at one level adversely affects determinations 
at all subsequent levels.  The calibration curve measurements should be generated starting with the lowest concentration.  
For  best  results,  the  conditions  used  for  determining  the  calibration  curve  should  closely  match  those  used  in  the 
measurement of the analyte.   Because fluorescence is a highly sensitive technique, great attention must be paid to the 
cleanliness of glassware and any other apparatus that contacts the solutions.   Many plastics and gloves can contaminate 
samples with small amounts of highly fluorescent materials such as release agents and plasticizers.  The running of blanks 
to check for such contamination is highly recommended. 
 
Assignment  of  Uncertainties:  A standard  uncertainty  component  equivalent  to  the  estimated  standard  deviation was 
assigned for sample inhomogeneity.  This value was then combined with gravimetric and purity uncertainties using the 
root-sum-of-squares method.  An expansion factor of k = 2 was applied so that the expanded uncertainties given in this 
certificate  express  an  interval  within  which  the  true  value  is  expected  to  fall  with  a  level  of  confidence  of 
approximately  95 %  for  a  normal distribution [5].  The upper limit of the bias due to evaporation of solvent during 
ampouling was also estimated and added to the expanded uncertainty.

Part D: Allophycocyanin Suspension 
 
Reference Values:  The purity of the allophycocyanin (APC) was estimated using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide 
gel  electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)  and  size  exclusion  chromatography (SEC)  for  material  qualification.    The  protein 
concentration was determined using amino acid analysis [7,8].  The measurand is the concentration of APC provided in 
Table 4A based on the indicated method.  An information APC purity value is provided in Table 4C.

in PBS, pH 7.4 with 0.02 % (w/w) Tween 20 was calculated using the absorbance value divided by the concentration and 
the  path  length,  and  is  reported  for  reference  value.    The  measurand  is  the  molar  extinction  coefficient  at  the  peak 
wavelengths listed based on the method indicated.

Source of Material:  The APC suspension was supplied by Life Technologies (Catalog #: A803, Lot #: 1575860, Product 
1575860,  Product 
information:  ~4 mg/mL,  M.W.  ~104,000,  medium,  60 %  saturated  ammonium  sulfate,  50 mM  potassium  phosphate, 
pH 7.0). 
 
Preparation of  Part D:  Twenty-eight vials of APC suspension were pooled after vortex to a single 50 mL centrifuge 
tube.  A small stir bar was added to the tube and the tube was placed on a stir plate with gentle stirring to ensure the 
suspension  was  mono-dispensed.    A  calibrated  pipettor  was  used  to  allocate  a  105 µL  suspension  into  a  0.5 mL 
polypropylene Sarstedt tubes (#72.730.105).  After tightening a cap on the tube and placing the SRM Part D label on the 
side of tube and a fill order indicator label on the top of the tube.  The tubes were stored in 4 °C refrigerator. 
 
Preparation of Part D for Analysis:  The SRM 1934 Part D is a suspension that should be resuspended using vigorous 
vortexing immediately before sampling, and it should always be diluted gravimetrically at least one-hundred fold with 
PBS, pH 7.4 with 0.02 % Tween 20.  Subsequent gravimetric dilutions can then be employed to generate a calibration 
curve.  The calibration curve describes the relationship between fluorescence intensity, as determined by the fluorometer 
and the concentration of APC, as determined by the gravimetric dilution.  Care must be taken in making the gravimetric 
dilutions because uncertainties expand during this serial process.  An error at one level adversely affects determinations 
at all subsequent levels.  The calibration curve measurements should be generated starting with the lowest concentration.  
For  best  results,  the  conditions  used  for  determining  the  calibration  curve  should  closely  match  those  used  in  the 
measurement of the analyte.  Because fluorescence is a highly sensitive technique, great attention must be paid to the 
cleanliness of glassware and any other apparatus that contacts the solutions.  Many plastics and gloves can contaminate 
samples with small amounts of highly fluorescent materials such as release agents and plasticizers.  The running of buffer 
blanks to check for such contamination is highly recommended. 
 
Assignment  of  Uncertainties:  The uncertainty includes all Type A evaluated elements, that is, between amino acid, 
within as well as between vial variability, calibration and pipetting [9,10].  A 3 % additional Type B uncertainty was also 
included  based  on  further  expert  evaluation  for  the  APC  concentration  determination.    The  standard  and  expanded 
uncertainty  for  the  determination  of  the  extinction  coefficient  includes  all  Type A  sources  from  APC  concentration 
analysis and those from the absorbance coefficient analysis as well as 3 % Type B uncertainty in the APC concentration.
