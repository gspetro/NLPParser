Fatty Acid Methyl Esters in 2,2,4-Trimethylpentane 
 

is  a  solution  of  26 fatty  acid  methyl  esters (FAMEs) 

in 
This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM) 
2,2,4-trimethylpentane.  This SRM is intended primarily for use in the calibration of chromatographic instrumentation 
used  for  the  determination  of  FAMEs.    A  unit  of  SRM 2377  consists  of  five  2-mL  ampoules,  each  containing 
approximately 1.2 mL of solution. 
 
Certified Mass Fractions of Constituents:  The certified mass fraction values and estimated uncertainties for the 
26 FAMEs are given in Table 1 along with the Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) Registry Numbers.  The certified 
mass fraction values are based on masses used in the gravimetric preparation of this solution and from the analytical 
results determined by using gas chromatography.  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest 
confidence  in  its  accuracy  in  that  all  known  or  suspected  sources  of  bias  have  been  investigated  or  taken  into 
account [1].  The measurand is the total mass fraction for each fatty acid methyl esters.  Metrological traceability is to 
the SI derived unit for mass faction (expressed as milligrams per gram). 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 2377 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until 30 June 2023, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with instructions given in this certificate 
(see  “Instructions  for  Handling,  Storage,  and  Use”).    The  certification  is  nullified  if  the  SRM  is  damaged, 
contaminated, or otherwise modified.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
Handling:  This material should be handled with care.  Use proper disposal methods. 
 
Storage:  The material should be stored under refrigeration (0 °C to 4 °C), in an unopened ampoule, until required for 
use.   
 
Use:  Prior to removal of a test portion for analysis, the contents of an ampoule should be allowed to warm to room 
temperature and mixed thoroughly.  Sample aliquots for analysis should be withdrawn at 20 °C to 25 °C immediately 
after opening the ampoules and should be processed without delay for the certified values in Table 1 to be valid within 
the  stated  uncertainties.    Because  of  the  volatility  of  2,2,4-trimethylpentane,  certified  values  are  not  applicable  to 
material stored in ampoules that have been opened for more than 5 minutes, even if they are resealed. 
 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
The  compounds  used  in  the  preparation  of  this  SRM  were  obtained  from  commercial  sources.    The  solution  was 
prepared at NIST by weighing and combining the individual compounds and 2,2,4-trimethylpentane.  The weighed 
components  were  added  to  the  2,2,4-trimethylpentane  and  mixed  overnight.    The  total  mass  of  this  solution  was 
measured,  and  the  mass  fractions  were  calculated.    These  gravimetric  concentrations  were  adjusted  for  the  purity 
estimation  of  each  component,  which  was  determined  by  using  capillary  gas  chromatography  with  two  stationary 
phases  of  different  polarities.    The  bulk  solution  was  chilled  slightly,  and  1.2 mL  aliquots  were  dispensed  into 
2-milliliter glass ampoules, which were flushed with argon then flame-sealed. 
 
Aliquots  from  nine  ampoules,  selected  using  a  random  stratified  sampling  scheme,  were  analyzed  in  duplicate  by 
using  capillary  gas  chromatography  with  flame  ionization  detection (GC-FID)  on  a  relatively  polar  nonbonded, 
biscyanopropyl polysiloxane phase (SP 2560, 100 m × 0.25 mm id, 0.25 µm film thickness, Supleco, Bellefonte, PA).  
The internal standard solution added to each sample for quantification purposes contained methyl tridecanoate, methyl 
heneicosanoate, and methyl octacosanoate.  Calibration solutions consisting of weighed amounts of the 26 FAMEs 
and  the  internal  standard  compounds  in  2,2,4-trimethylpentane  were  chromatographically  analyzed  to  determine 
analyte response factors. 

                                                           

(1)Certain  commercial  equipment,  instruments  or  materials  are  identified  in  this  certificate  to  adequately  specify  the 
experimental procedure.  Such identification does not imply recommendation or endorsement by the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the purpose.

(b)  The reference value is a weighted mean of the mass fractions determined by gravimetric and chromatographic measurements [2], corrected for 
purity.  The uncertainty listed with each value is an expanded uncertainty about the mean [3,4], with coverage factor 2 (approximately 95 % 
confidence), calculated by combining a between-method variance incorporating inter-method variance following the ISO/JCGM Guide [5].
