of  pathlength  on 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is a certified absorbance standard for the determination of pathlength on 
microliter volume spectrophotometers and fixed pathlength cuvettes.  A unit of SRM 2082 consists of three 2 mL 
ampoules, one ampoule each of a blank buffer solution (10 mM 2-amino-2-hydroxymethyl-propane-1,3 diol (TRIS) 
buffer,  pH 8.0);  tryptophan (1.4 mM)  in  TRIS  buffer  (component A);  and  uracil  (1.0 mM)  in  TRIS  buffer 
(component B).  Each ampoule contains approximately 1.8 mL of solution. 
 
Certified Values:  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that 
all  known  or  suspected  sources  of  bias  have  been  investigated  or  taken  into  account [1].    Values  obtained  using 
equations 1 to 6 are certified within the limits given in this certificate.  Equations 1 and 2 are the functions of the 
absorbance  at  280 nm,  A280,  and  260 nm,  A260,  with  respect  to  pathlength  in  millimeters  for  component A  and 
component B, respectively, measured against the TRIS buffer, with a spectral bandwidth of 0.8 nm, and a temperature 
of 22.0 ºC ± 0.1 ºC.  The absorbance at the respective wavelengths are calculated as the absorbance of the component 
solution, at 280 nm or 260 nm, minus the absorbance of the TRIS buffer at the same wavelength.  For conditions other 
than 22 °C and 0.8 nm spectral bandwidth, there are correction factors for temperatures between 18 °C and 30 °C and 
for spectral bandwidths from 0.8 nm to 5.0 nm given as equations 3 and 4 with coefficients and constants given in 
Table 1.  Equation 5 and 6 are used to calculate the pathlength in millimeters.  The uncertainty is estimated from the 
evaluation of multiple vials of each component and from the uncertainty of the pathlengths of the calibrated cuvettes, 
temperature  and  spectral  bandwidth.    Uncertainties  are  given  in  the  form  of  equation 7,  and  are  dependent  on  the 
measurement parameters of the SRM with coefficients and constants given in Table 2.  The measurand is pathlength.  
Metrological traceability is to the SI unit for length, expressed as millimeters. 
 
Information Values:  A NIST information value is a value that may be of interest to the SRM user, but insufficient 
information is available to assess the uncertainty associated with the value, therefore no uncertainty is provided [1].  
Values obtained with equations 10 and 11 are for information purposes only.  Information values cannot be used to 
establish metrological traceability. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 2082 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified,

SRM 2082 

INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE  
 
Handling and Storage:  SRM 2082 should be stored at –20 °C until it is ready for use.  Keep the product in the dark 
while in storage, as long term exposure to UV light can cause photo-degradation of component A (tryptophan).  It is 
recommended that the  SRM  vials be kept in the  storage box, and be thawed at 4 °C overnight or thawed at room 
temperature for a few hours.  The SRM vials should not be heated to thaw as this may promote degradation of the 
SRM components.  
 
Based upon our stability studies, SRM 2082 may be stored at 4 °C for up to three months without degradation.  It 
should be mixed thoroughly and centrifuged before using after standing for long periods of time. 
 
SRM  SOLUTIONS  MUST  BE  PROPERLY  MIXED  PRIOR  TO  USE.    After  the  SRM  has  been  completely 
thawed,  the  individual  vials  must  be  mixed  thoroughly  since  it  has  been  observed  that  freezing  will  promote 
concentration gradients and/or sample adhesion to the supplied tubes.  These gradients will remain in the vial after 
thawing without adequate mixing.  Mixing should be accomplished by first inverting the vials 20 times, insuring that 
the air bubble has traveled all the way up the vial, then by mechanical mixing using a vortexing mixer for 30 seconds.  
The inversion of the vial and vortexing should be performed a total of 3 times to ensure the sample is ready for use.  
Vortexing the vials at a low angle (30° from horizontal) will improve the efficiency of mixing.  Ensure that the vial is 
securely closed before mixing.  Brief centrifugation before opening is recommended as well. 
 
Use:  SRM 2082 is used to calibrate the pathlength for fixed pathlength cuvettes or microvolume spectrophotometers 
that utilize fixed or variable pathlength sample cells and is certified for use with pathlengths between 0.1 mm and 
2.0 mm.  SRM 2082 should be brought up to the temperature of the spectrophotometer on which the measurements 
will  be  made.    Often  this  is  room  temperature;  however,  this  may  not  be  the  case  depending  on  the  set  up  of  the 
instrument, and provisions should be made accordingly.  The spectrophotometer should be started and run using the 
manufacturer’s recommendations with sufficient time to warm up to operating temperature if necessary. 
 
Starting with the buffer solution, pipette enough of the liquid into the measurement chamber of the spectrophotometer 
to  meet  the  manufacturer’s  specifications  for  proper  measurements.    Measure  a  baseline  UV  absorbance  at  the 
wavelength(s)  of  interest,  which  is  ideally  a  spectrum  from  340 nm  to  240 nm.    The  baseline  may  be  subtracted 
automatically by the instrument, or it may be subtracted manually at a later time.  Repeat the measurements using 
component A (tryptophan) and component B (uracil).  Ensure that enough replicate measurements have been made 
using all parts of SRM 2082 to achieve the desired statistical sampling for the measurements. 
 
The vial used for the SRM should be opened, sample removed, and closed securely to prevent evaporation, which may 
cause a change in the concentration of the solutions. 
   
When  using  SRM 2082,  the  temperature  of  the  room  or  instrument  should  be  recorded  along  with  the  spectral 
bandwidth of the instrument.  The temperature should be measured with a calibrated thermometer that is accurate to 
to 
within  ± 0.25 K  and  is  traceable  to  the  International  Temperature  Scale  of  1990.    Spectral  bandwidth  of  the 
spectrophotometer should be obtained from the instrument manufacturer. 
 
For  user  convenience,  a  spreadsheet  containing  the  coefficients  of  the  certified  model,  confidence  band,  and  a 
calculator 
at  
https://www-s.nist.gov/srmors/view_detail.cfm?srm=2082 [2]. Utilizing estimates of absorbance uncertainty, u(Ec), 
below  0.001  A  is  not  recommended  unless  the  user  has  performed  a  careful  uncertainty  analysis  of  their 
instrumentation.  Instrument precision alone may significantly underestimate uncertainty. 
 
Uracil  (#U0750,
Preparation  and  Analysis:    The  SRM 2082  solutions  were  prepared  and  packaged  at  NIST.    Uracil  (#U0750, 
Lot No. SLBD1250V) and L-Tryptophan (#93659, Lot No. 1400132V) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and used 
as received.  A stock solution of TRIS buffer (1 M, pH 8.0) was obtained from Ambion Life Technologies (#AM9856, 
Lot No. 1001017).  Bulk solutions were prepared to attain final concentrations of nominally 1.0 mM uracil and 1.5 mM 
tryptophan in 10 mM TRIS buffer.  The prepared solutions were dispensed in 1.7 mL aliquots into sterile 2 mL sample 
tubes in a sterile hood.  The packaged samples were stored at –20 ºC. 
 
Cuvettes constructed from Spectrosil® quartz were obtained from Starna with nominal pathlengths of 0.5 mm, 1 mm, 
and 2 mm.  Additional quartz cuvettes were obtained from Precision Cell Inc., with nominal pathlengths of 0.2 mm 
and  0.1 mm.    The  pathlength  of  the  0.5 mm,  1.0 mm  and  2.0 mm  cuvettes  were  measured  by  NIST  Dimensional 
Metrology Group using a coordinate measuring machine with a fiber probe having a tip with an ellipsoidal geometry.  
The  uncertainty  for  this  instrument  has  been  shown  to  have  a  deviation  of  ± 0.11 µm  for  measurements  in  one 
dimension.  Pathlengths for the 0.5 mm, 0.1 mm, and 0.2 mm cells were determined by interference fringes in the

near-infrared  spectral  region.    Measurements  across  the  collection  of  cuvettes  of  both  uracil  and  tryptophan  were 
observed to be linear with respect to pathlength and thus adhered to the Beer-Lambert law. 
 
To test for homogeneity, 12 units were selected using a step randomization method based on filling order, with two 
random units selected out of every sequential hundred units.  All units were measured at 22 °C, at a spectral bandwidth 
of 0.8 nm, using the same 0.5 mm cuvette.  No significant heterogeneity or correlations with respect to filling order 
were observed and the lot was deemed suitably homogenous. 
 
Certification:  The buffer corrected absorbance of component A and component B have been determined in the UV 
region at the absorbance peaks of tryptophan and uracil, 280 nm and 260 nm, respectively.  The spectra of tryptophan 
and  uracil  are  shown  in  Figure 1.    Absorbance  measurements  are  traceable  to  the  NIST  High  Accuracy 
Spectrophotometer [3].    Absorbance  measurements  were  made  at  22 °C  and  a  spectral  bandwidth  of  0.8 nm.  
Correction  factors  have  been  measured  to  allow  for  the  determination  of  the  pathlength  in  the  temperature  range 
between 18 °C and 30 °C and for the variation in spectral bandwidth from 0.8 nm to 5.0 nm.

Coefficients used in the calculation of the pathlength based on the TRIS buffer corrected absorbance measurements 
cbance  measurements 
of SRM 2082 for Component A (tryptophan) and Component B (uracil) at 280 nm and 260 nm, respectively are shown 
in  Table 1.   The  absorbance A,  of  tryptophan  and  uracil  follow  the  Beer-Lambert  law  in  the  region  studied.    The 
constant Ec correlates the absorbance of the tryptophan or uracil solutions to the pathlength, l (in millimeters), through 
the relationship A = Ec·l and are the same as the constants in equations 1 and 2.  Coefficients a1 and a0 are used in 
equation 3 to relate the change in absorbance to temperature from 18 °C to 30 °C.  Coefficients b2, b1, and b0 are used 
in equation 4 to relate the change in absorbance to the spectral bandwidth from 0.8 nm to 5.0 nm. 
 
The pathlength can be determined from equations 1 and 2 by rearrangement into the form l = A/Ec.  If the absorbance 
is  not  measured  at  22 °C  and  0.8 nm  spectral  bandwidth,  correction  factors  to  the  absorbance  must  be  applied  to 
calculate the pathlength.  
 
The absorbance change due to temperature is defined as ∆tA = A22°C − At, where A22°C is the absorbance at 22 °C and 
At is the absorbance at temperature t, in Celsius.  The change in absorbance with respect to temperature for a 1 mm 
pathlength is linear in the range from 18 °C to 30 °C, and can be expressed in the following form: 
 
 
 
where  a1  and  a0  are  constants,  and  are  listed  in  Table 1  for  components  A  and  B.    The  value  of  ∆tA  scales 
proportionately with pathlength, with equation 3 representing ∆tA at a reference condition of 1 mm.  
 
The second correction to the absorbance measurements arises from the effect of the spectral bandwidth on the apparent 
absorbance  of  the  SRM.    The  change  in  absorbance  due  to  the  spectral  bandwidth,  ∆BA,  is  defined  as 
∆BA = A0.8 nm – ABλ,  where  A0.8 nm  is  the  absorbance  at  the  reference  spectral  bandwidth  of  0.8 nm  and  ABλ  is  the 
measured absorbance at spectral bandwidth, Bλ, in nm.  The deviation of the absorbance with respect to the spectral 
bandwidth is nonlinear and between 0.8 nm and 5 nm may be fit to quadratic equations of the form: 
 
 
 
where b2, b1, and b0 are constants, and Bλ is the spectral bandwidth (in nanometers).  The constants for the deviation 
of the absorbance due to spectral bandwidth over a 1 mm pathlength are given in Table 1.  The functions of ∆BA were 
determined using absorbance measurements at two pathlengths, with the value of ∆BA scaling linearly with pathlength. 
Equation 4 is defined at 1 mm pathlength as a convenient reference condition.  
 
following 
To  calculate  the  pathlength  in  mm  based  on  the  absorbance,  temperature,  and  spectral  bandwidth,  the  following 
equation should be used: 

∆tΑ  =  a1 • t  +  a0 

2  +  b1 • Bλ +  b0 

∆BA  =  b2 • Bλ

18 °C to 30 °C, and/or with a spectral bandwidth greater than 5 nm will NOT yield certified values for a calculated 
pathlength. 
 
Uncertainty  Calculation:    The  combined  standard  measurement  uncertainty  comprises  one  set  of  components 
evaluated by application of statistical methods (Type A evaluation).  The Type A uncertainties include contributions 
attributable to the uncertainties in the reference cuvette pathlength, the uncertainty in absorbance from the transfer 
spectrophotometer,  variation  in  the  measured  spectral  bandwidth,  uncertainty  in  the  absolute  temperature,  and  the 
sample to sample variation. 
 
A certified model of the derived pathlength uncertainty was obtained by propagation of error methods in accordance 
with  Supplement 1  to  the  ISO/JCGM  Guide [4].    The  combined  uncertainty  is  derived  from  uncertainties  of  the 
absorbance  as  well  as  from  uncertainties  given  in  Table 1.    The  uncertainty  in  the  calculated  pathlength,  u(l),  as 
calculated from equation 6 takes the form:

u2(∆tA) = au2·t2 + au1·t + au0 

 
where  u(Ec)  is  the  uncertainty  of  the  absorbance  with  respect  to pathlength  (see  equations  1  and  2),  u(∆tA)  is  the 
uncertainty of the temperature correction, u(∆BA) is the uncertainty of the spectral bandwidth correction, and u(A) is 
the uncertainty of the measured absorbance.   
 
The uncertainty of the temperature correction derives from the uncertainty of the constants a1 and a0 in equation 3 
(listed in Table 1).  Since the constants are interrelated and dependent on the temperature, the total uncertainty from 
temperature is determined as a function of t using the covariance between a1 and a0, and is expressed as a simple 
quadratic equation of the form: 
 
 
 
where au2, au1, and au0 are constants.  
a 
 
Similarly, the uncertainty of the spectral bandwidth correction derives from the uncertainty of the constants b2, b1, and 
b0  from  equation 4  (listed  in  Table 1).   This  correction  factor  is  a  function  of  the  spectral  bandwidth,  Bλ,  and  the 
ul 
uncertainty  is  also  calculated  from  the  covariance  of  the  constants  b2,  b1,  and  b0.    The uncertainty  of  the  spectral 
bandwidth can be expressed simply as a polynomial of the form: 
 
 
 
where bu3, bu2, bu1, and bu0 are constants. 
 
All of the constants for the calculation of the uncertainty are listed in Table 2 for both tryptophan and uracil. 
 
The last term in equation 7 relates to the customer’s uncertainty in the experimental absorbance measurement.  It is 
recommended that the user make ten replicate measurements of the absorbance A, with reloading of the sample for 
each  measurement.  The average value of A  may be used to calculate l, and the standard deviation of  A, σA,  will 
approximate u(A).  
 
The  final  expanded  uncertainty  of  the  pathlength,  U95(l),  using  the  absorbance  of  SRM 2082  is  calculated  by 
U95(l) = k·u(l), where k is the coverage factor for the 95 % confidence interval.  For the recommended ten replicate 
uncertainty
absorbance measurements, k = 2.26 and the expanded uncertainty is U95(l) = 2.26 u(l).

Component A (tryptophan) and Component B (uracil) at 280 nm and 260 nm, respectively, are shown above.  The 
constant u(Ec) corresponds to the uncertainty of equations 1 and 2.  Coefficients au2, au1, and au0 are used in equation 8

Information Values:  Some instruments may have fixed spectral bandwidths that are outside of the range measured 
in the preparation of the certificate for SRM 2082.  To extend the useful range, we have used a convolution method 
outlined  by  Travis  et  al.  to  calculate  spectra  out  to  a  spectral  bandwidth  of  10 nm  using  the  experimental  spectra 
obtained at 1.0 nm spectral bandwidth [5].
