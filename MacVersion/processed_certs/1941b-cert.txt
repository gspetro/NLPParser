Standard Reference Material® 1941b 

 

Organics in Marine Sediment 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is marine sediment collected at the mouth of the Baltimore (MD) Harbor.  
SRM 1941b is intended for use in evaluating analytical methods for the determination of selected polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners, and chlorinated pesticides in marine sediment and 
similar matrices.  Information values are also provided for total organic carbon (TOC), total carbon, hydrogen, and 
nitrogen.  All of the constituents for which certified, reference, and information values are provided in SRM 1941b 
were naturally present in the sediment before processing.  A unit of SRM 1941b consists of a bottle containing 50 g 
of radiation-sterilized, freeze-dried sediment. 
 
chlorinated 
Certified  Mass  Fraction  Values:    Certified  mass  fraction  values  for  PAHs,  PCB  congeners,  and  chlorinated 
pesticides are provided in Table 1 through Table 3.  The certified values for the PAHs, PCB congeners, and chlorinated 
pesticides are based on the agreement of results obtained at NIST from two or more chemically independent analytical 
techniques along with results from an interlaboratory comparison study [1].  A NIST certified value is a value for 
which  NIST  has  the  highest  confidence  in  its  accuracy  in  that  all  known  or  suspected  sources  of  bias  have  been 
investigated or taken into account [1]. 
 
Reference  Mass  Fraction  Values:    Reference  mass  fraction  values  for  additional  PAHs  (some  in  combination), 
additional PCB congeners, and additional chlorinated pesticides are provided in Table 4 through Table 7.  Reference 
values for alkylated PAH groups are provided in Table 8 and for selected hopanes and steranes in Table 9.  A reference 
value  for total organic carbon is provided in Table 10.  Reference  values are noncertified values that are  the best 
estimate of the true value; however, the values do not meet the NIST criteria for certification and are provided with 
associated uncertainties that may reflect only measurement precision, may not include all sources of uncertainty, or 
may reflect a lack of sufficient statistical agreement among multiple analytical methods [1]. 
 
Information Mass Fraction Values:  Information mass fraction values are provided in Table 11 for carbon, hydrogen, 
and nitrogen.  An information value is considered to be a value that will be of use to the SRM user, but insufficient 
information is available to assess the uncertainty associated with the value [1].  Information values cannot be used to 
establish metrological traceability.

Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 1941b is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until 01 October 2020, provided the SRM is  handled and  stored in accordance  with the instructions given in this 
certificate (see “Instructions for Handling, Storage, and Use”).  This certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, 
contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Coordination of the technical measurements leading to the certification of this material was under the leadership of 
M.M. Schantz and S.A. Wise of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division. 
 
Analytical measurements for the certification of SRM 1941b were performed at NIST by J.R. Kucklick, B.J. Porter, 
D.L. Poster, M.M. Schantz, P. Schubert, S. Tutschku, and L.L. Yu of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
Handling:  This material is naturally occurring marine sediment from an urban area and may contain constituents of 
unknown toxicities; therefore, caution and care should be exercised during its handling and use. 
 
Storage:    SRM  1941b  must  be  stored  in  its  original  bottle  at  temperatures  less  than  30  °C  and  away  from  direct 
sunlight. 
 
Use:  Prior to removal of subsamples for analysis, the contents of the bottle should be mixed.  The mass fractions of 
constituents in SRM 1941b are reported on a dry-mass basis.  The SRM, as received, contains a  mass  fraction of 
approximately 2.4 %  moisture (see “Conversion  to Dry-Mass Basis”).  The sediment sample should be dried to a 
constant  mass before  weighing for analysis; or a separate subsample of the sediment should be removed from the 
bottle at the time of analysis  and dried to determine the  mass  fraction on a dry-mass basis.  If the constituents of 
interest are volatile, then the moisture must be determined with a separate subsample. 
 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Sample Collection and Preparation:  The sediment used to prepare this SRM was collected from the Chesapeake 
Bay at the mouth of the Baltimore (MD) Harbor near the Francis Scott Key Bridge (39o12.3’N and 76o31.4’W).  This 
location is very near the site where SRM 1941 and SRM 1941a were collected.  The sediment was collected using a 
Kynar-coated modified Van Veen-type grab sampler.  A total of approximately 3300 kg of wet sediment was collected 
from the site.  The sediment was freeze-dried, sieved at 150 µm (100 % passing), homogenized in a cone blender, 
radiation  sterilized  (60Co),  and  then  packaged  in  screw-capped  amber  glass  bottles  each  containing  approximately 
50 g. 
 
Conversion to Dry-Mass Basis:  The results for the constituents in SRM 1941b are reported on a dry-mass basis; 
however,  the  material  “as  received”  contains  residual  moisture.    The  amount  of  moisture  in  SRM  1941b  was 
determined by measuring the mass loss after freeze-drying subsamples of 1.1 g to 1.3 g for four days at 1 Pa with a  
–10 °C shelf temperature and a –50 °C condenser temperature.  The moisture content in SRM 1941b at the time of the 
certification analyses was 2.39 % ± 0.08 % (95 % confidence level).  Analytical results for the organic constituents 
were determined on an as-received basis and then converted to a dry-mass basis by dividing by the conversion factor 
of 0.9761 (gram dry mass per gram as-received mass). 
 
Polycyclic  Aromatic  Hydrocarbons:    The  general  approach  used  for  the  value  assignment  of  the  PAHs  in 
SRM 1941b was similar to that reported in detail elsewhere [2].  The approach consisted of combining results from 
analyses using various combinations of different extraction techniques and solvents, clean-up/isolation procedures, 
and chromatographic separation and detection techniques:  Soxhlet extraction and pressurized-fluid extraction (PFE) 
using dichloromethane (DCM) or a hexane/acetone mixture, cleanup of the extracts using solid-phase extraction (SPE) 
or normal-phase liquid chromatography (LC), followed by analysis using the following techniques:  (1) reversed-phase 
liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (LC-FL) analysis of the total PAH fraction, (2) reversed-phase 

                                                           

(1) Certain  commercial  equipment,  instruments  or  materials  are  identified  in  this  certificate  to  adequately  specify  the 
experimental procedure.  Such identification does not imply recommendation or endorsement by the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the purpose.

LC-FL  analysis  of  isomeric  PAH  fractions  isolated  by  normal-phase  LC  (i.e.,  multidimensional  LC),  (3)  gas 
chromatography/mass  spectrometry  (GC/MS)  analysis  of  the  PAH  fraction  on  three  stationary  phases  of  different 
selectivity,  i.e.,  a  5  %  (all  column  compositions  are  given  as  mole  fractions  in  %)  phenyl-substituted 
methylpolysiloxane phase, a 50 % phenyl-substituted methylpolysiloxane phase, and a relatively non-polar proprietary 
phase. 
 
Three sets of GC/MS results, designated as GC/MS (I), GC/MS (II), and GC/MS (III), were obtained using  three 
columns with different selectivities for the separation of PAHs.  For GC/MS (I) analyses, duplicate subsamples of 
approximately 1 g from ten bottles of SRM 1941b were extracted using PFE with DCM.  Copper powder was added 
to the extract to remove elemental sulfur.  The concentrated extract was passed through an aminopropyl SPE cartridge 
and eluted with 2 % DCM in hexane (all solvent concentrations are given as volume fractions in %).  The processed 
extract  was  then  analyzed  by  GC/MS  using  a  0.25  mm  i.d.  ×  60  m  fused  silica  capillary  column  with  a  5  % 
phenyl-substituted methylpolysiloxane phase (0.25 µm film thickness; DB-5 MS, J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA).  The 
GC/MS (II) analyses were performed using 5 g subsamples from six bottles of SRM 1941b.  These samples were 
extracted using PFE with DCM.  The high molecular mass compounds were removed from the extracts using size 
exclusion chromatography (SEC) with a preparative-scale divinylbenzene-polystyrene column (10 µm particle size 
with 10 nm diameter pores), and the sulfur was removed from the extracts by adding copper powder.  The concentrated 
extract was passed through an aminopropyl SPE cartridge and eluted with 10 % DCM in hexane.  The analysis was 
by  GC/MS  using  a  0.25  mm  i.d.  ×  60  m  fused  silica  capillary  column  with  a  50  %  phenyl-substituted 
methylpolysiloxane phase (0.25 µm film thickness; DB-17 MS, J&W Scientific).  For the GC/MS (III), 9 g subsamples 
from six bottles of SRM 1941b were Soxhlet-extracted for 18 h  with 250 mL of a  mixture of 50 % hexane/50 % 
acetone.  Copper powder was added to the extract to remove elemental sulfur, and the concentrated extract was passed 
through a silica SPE cartridge and eluted with 10 % DCM in hexane.  The processed extract was then analyzed by 
GC/MS  using  a  0.25  mm  i.d.  ×  60  m  fused  silica  capillary  column  with  a  relatively  non-polar  proprietary  phase 
(0.25 µm film thickness; DB-XLB, J&W Scientific). 
 
ertification  process. 
Two sets of LC-FL results, designated as LC-FL (total) and LC-FL (isomer), were used in the certification process.  
For the LC-FL (total), subsamples of approximately 1 g from six bottles of SRM 1941b were extracted using PFE 
with  a  mixture  of  50  %  hexane/50  %  acetone.    The  extracts  were  concentrated  and  then  processed  through  an 
aminopropylsilane SPE cartridge using 2 % DCM in hexane to obtain the total PAH fraction.  For the LC-FL (isomer), 
a 5 g subsample from the six bottles was extracted using PFE with DCM and processed through an aminopropylsilane 
SPE  cartridge  using  10  %  DCM  in  hexane;  the  PAH  fraction  was  then  fractionated  further  on  a  semi-preparative 
aminopropylsilane column (µBondapak NH2, 9 mm i.d. × 30 cm, Waters Associates, Milford, MA) to isolate isomeric 
PAH fractions as described previously [3–6].  The total PAH fraction and the isomeric PAH fractions were analyzed 
using a 5 µm particle-size polymeric octadecylsilane (C18) column (4.6 mm i.d. × 25 cm, Hypersil-PAH, Keystone 
Scientific, Inc., Bellefonte, PA) with wavelength-programmed fluorescence detection [4,5]. 
 
For the GC/MS and LC-FL measurements described above, selected perdeuterated PAHs were added to the sediment 
prior to solvent extraction for use as internal standards for quantification purposes. 
 
In addition to the analyses performed at NIST, SRM 1941b was used in an interlaboratory comparison exercise in 
1999 as part of the NIST Intercomparison Exercise Program for Organic Contaminants in the Marine Environment [7].  
Results from 38 laboratories that participated in this exercise were used as the sixth data set in the determination of 
the  certified  values  for  PAHs  in  SRM  1941b.    The  laboratories  participating  in  this  exercise  used  the  analytical 
procedures routinely used in their laboratories to measure the analytes of interest. 
 
Homogeneity Assessment for PAHs:  The homogeneity of SRM 1941b was assessed by analyzing duplicate samples 
of approximately 1 g from ten bottles selected by stratified random sampling.  Samples were extracted, processed, and 
10ng  bottles  were  observed  for
analyzed as described above for GC/MS (I).  No statistically significant differences among bottles were observed for 
the PAHs at this sample size.  
 
PAH Isomers of Molecular Mass 300 and 302:  For the determination of the molecular mass 300 and 302 isomers, 
three subsamples of approximately 5 g each were extracted using PFE with DCM.  The extracts were then concentrated 
with a solvent change to hexane and passed through an aminopropyl SPE cartridge and eluted with 10 % DCM in 
hexane. The processed extract was then analyzed by GC/MS using a 0.25 mm i.d. × 60 m fused silica capillary column 
with  a  50  %  phenyl-substituted  methylpolysiloxane  phase  (0.25  µm  film  thickness;  DB-17MS,  J&W  Scientific).  
Perdeuterated dibenzo[a,i]pyrene was added to the sediment prior to extraction for use as an internal standard [8].  
 
PCBs  and  Chlorinated  Pesticides:    The  general  approach  used  for  the  determination  of  PCBs  and  chlorinated 
pesticides  in  SRM  1941b  consisted  of  combining  results  from  analyses  using  various  combinations  of  different 
extraction  techniques  and  solvents,  cleanup/isolation  procedures,  and  chromatographic  separation  and  detection 
techniques.  Techniques and solvents included Soxhlet extraction and PFE using DCM or a hexane/acetone mixture,

clean-up/isolation using SPE or LC, followed by analysis using GC/MS and gas chromatography with electron capture 
detection (GC-ECD) on two columns with different selectivity for the separation of PCBs and chlorinated pesticides.  
The analytical methods are described in detail elsewhere [2]. 
 
Six  sets  of  results  were  obtained  and  designated  as  GC-ECD  (I)  A  and  B,  GC/MS  (I) A  and  B,  GC/MS  (II),  and 
Interlaboratory Comparison Exercise.  For the GC-ECD (I) analyses, approximately 10 g subsamples from six bottles 
of SRM 1941b were extracted using PFE with DCM.  Copper powder was added to the extract to remove elemental 
sulfur, and SEC, as described above, was used to remove the high molecular mass compounds.  The concentrated 
extract  was  then  fractionated  on a semi-preparative aminopropylsilane column  to isolate  two  fractions containing:  
(1) the PCBs and lower-polarity pesticides and (2) the more polar pesticides.  GC-ECD analyses of the two fractions 
were performed on two columns of different selectivities for PCB separations:  0.25 mm × 60 m fused silica capillary 
column with a 5 % phenyl-substituted methylpolysiloxane phase (0.25 µm film thickness; DB-5, J&W Scientific), 
and a 0.25 mm  × 60  m fused silica capillary column  with a non-polar proprietary phase (0.25  µm  film  thickness; 
DB-XLB, J&W Scientific).  The results from the 5 % phenyl phase are designated as GC-ECD (IA) and the results 
from the proprietary phase are designated as GC-ECD (IB).  For the GC-ECD analyses, two PCB congeners that are 
not significantly present in the sediment extract (PCB 103 and PCB 198 [9,10]) and endosulfan I-d4, 4,4’-DDE-d8, 
4,4'-DD-d8,  and  4,4'-DDT-d8  were  added  to  the  sediment  prior  to  extraction  for  use  as  internal  standards  for 
quantification purposes. 
 
Two sets of results were obtained by GC/MS.  For GC/MS (I), approximately 9 g subsamples from six bottles were 
Soxhlet- extracted with a mixture of 50 % hexane/50 % acetone for approximately 18 h.  Copper powder was added 
to the extract to remove elemental sulfur, and the concentrated extract was passed through a silica SPE cartridge and 
eluted with 10 % DCM in hexane.  The processed extract was then analyzed by GC/MS with two ionization modes, 
electron  impact  (EI)  and  negative  ion  chemical  ionization  (NICI).    The  GC/MS  EI  method,  GC/MS  (IA),  used  a 
0.25  mm  i.d.  ×  60  m  fused  silica  capillary  column  with  a  relatively  non-polar  proprietary  phase  (0.25  µm  film 
thickness; DB-XLB, J&W Scientific).  The GC/MS NICI method, GC/MS (IB), used a 0.25 mm i.d. × 60 m fused 
silica capillary column with a 5 % phenyl-substituted methylpolysiloxane phase (0.25 µm film thickness; DB-5MS, 
J&W Scientific).  The GC/MS (II) results were obtained in the same manner as the GC/MS (IA) analyses except that 
three  subsamples  were  Soxhlet-extracted  with  DCM  for  approximately  18  h.    For  the  GC/MS  analyses,  selected 
carbon-13 labeled PCB congeners and chlorinated pesticides were added to the sediment prior to extraction for use as 
internal standards for quantification purposes. 
 
In addition to the analyses performed at NIST, SRM 1941b was used in an interlaboratory comparison exercise in 
1999 as part of the NIST Intercomparison Exercise Program for Organic Contaminants in the Marine Environment [7].  
Results from 38 laboratories that participated in this exercise were used as the sixth data set in the determination of 
the certified values for PCB congeners and chlorinated pesticides in SRM 1941b.  The laboratories participating in 
this exercise used the analytical procedures routinely used in their laboratories to measure the analytes of interest. 
 
The reference value for PCB 77 was determined from a separate fraction.  The samples were extracted and processed 
as  for  GC-ECD  (I)  above.    The  first  (PCB  and  lower-polarity  pesticide)  fraction  from  the  semi-preparative 
aminopropylsilane column was further fractionated using a Cosmosil PYE (pyrenylethyl group bonded) column (5 µm 
particle size, 4.6 mm i.d. × 25 cm ; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) [11].  Three fractions were collected:  the first fraction 
contained  the  pesticides  and  multi-ortho  PCBs,  the  second  fraction  contained  the  polychlorinated  naphthalenes, 
non-ortho PCB congeners, and some mono-ortho PCB congeners, and the third fraction removed the residual planar 
compounds  from  the  column.    The  second  fraction  was  analyzed  by  GC/MS  NICI  using  the  same  column  as 
GC/MS (IB) above.  Carbon-13 labeled PCB 77 was used as an internal standard for quantification purposes. 
 
Alkylated PAH Groups, Hopanes, and Steranes:  SRM 1941b was used in an interlaboratory comparison exercise 
in 2011 [12].  Results  from 33 laboratories that participated in this exercise were used in the determination of the 
reference  values  for  alkylated  PAH  groups,  hopanes,  and  steranes  in  SRM  1941b.    Note  that  not  all  laboratories 
returned data for each analyte.  The laboratories participating in this exercise used the analytical procedures routinely 
used in their laboratories to measure the analytes of interest.  For the alkylated PAHs, the majority of the laboratories 
(>90 %) used the parent PAH for determination of the response factor for the corresponding alkylated group. 
 
Total  Organic  Carbon  (TOC):    Two  laboratories  provided  results  for  TOC  using  similar  procedures.    Briefly, 
subsamples of approximately 200 mg were reacted with 6 mol/L hydrochloric acid and rinsed with deionized water 
prior to combustion in a gas fusion furnace.  The carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide produced were measured and 
compared to a blank for calculation of the percent TOC.  Each laboratory analyzed subsamples from three bottles of 
SRM 1941b.  One of the laboratories also analyzed three subsamples from three bottles of SRM 1941b for carbon, 
hydrogen, and nitrogen.

(a)  The reference mass fraction value reported on a dry-mass basis is the median of results using one analytical technique.  The 
expanded uncertainty, U, is calculated as U = kuc, where uc is one standard deviation of the median, and the coverage factor, k = 2.  
The measurand is the total mass fraction of the alkylated PAH groups listed as determined by the interlaboratory study methods.  
The  values  listed  are  metrologically  traceable  to  the  SI  unit  of  mass  fraction,  expressed  as  micrograms  per  kilogram  on  a 
dry-mass basis.

(a) Mass fraction is reported on a dry-mass basis; material as received contains approximately 2.4 % moisture. 
(b) The reference value for total organic carbon is a weighted mean value from routine measurements made by two laboratories [21].  
The uncertainty listed is an expanded uncertainty about the mean, with coverage  factor 2 (approximately 95 % confidence), 
calculated by  combining a between-method variance incorporating inter-method bias with a pooled within-method variance.  
The reporting follows the ISO/JCGM Guides [2].  The measurand is the total mass fraction of TOC listed as determined by the 
methods indicted.  The values listed are metrologically traceable to the SI unit of mass, expressed as a percent on a dry-mass 
basis.
