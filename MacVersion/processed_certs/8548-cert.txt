Report of Investigation 
 
Reference Material 8548 
 
IAEA-N-2 

(Nitrogen Isotopes in Ammonium Sulfate) 
 
This  Reference  Material (RM)  is  intended  for  use  in  developing  and  validating  methods  for  measuring  relative 
differences in nitrogen (N) isotope-number ratios, R(15N/14N) [1].  Even though the value for this RM is a reference 
value and not certified [2], its use will improve the comparability of data from different laboratories.  The equivalent 
name used by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) for this RM 
is IAEA-N-2.  RM 8548 consists of one vial containing approximately 0.4 g of ammonium sulfate salt ((NH4)2SO4).

(a)  A reference value is a non-certified value that is the best estimate of the true value; however, the value may reflect only the 

measurement precision and may not include all sources of uncertainty [2]. 

(b)  IAEA-N-2 is also known as IAEA-N2. 
(c)  The  δ15NAIR  value  is  expressed  as  a  mean  and  an  expanded  uncertainty.    The  expanded  uncertainty  is  equal  to U = kuc, 
where uc is the combined standard uncertainty as defined by the ISO Guide [3] and k is the coverage factor.  The combined 
standard  uncertainty  is  intended  to  represent,  at  the  level  of  one  standard  deviation,  the  effect  of  random  errors  on  the 
reference  value  that  were  evaluated  by  statistical  means  (Type A).    Any  uncertainty  due  to  biases  in  the  methods  is  not 
included in the expanded uncertainty.  The coverage factor, k = 2.179 (n=13), provides an expanded uncertainty interval 
that  has  about  a  95 %  probability  of  encompassing  the  mean.    The  values  for  RM 8548  are  taken  from  reference 4.  
(AIR – N2 of tropospheric air). 

Reference Difference in Isotope-Number Ratio Values:  The differences in measured isotope-number ratios of 
stable  nitrogen  isotopes  in  substance  P,  R(15N/14N)P = [N(15N)P / N(14N)P],  are  reported  as  δ15N  values [5].  The 
relative differences in isotope-number ratios for nitrogen are referenced to AIR where: 

δ15N = [R(15N/14N)sample / R(15N/14N)AIR] – 1 
AIR refers to N2 of tropospheric air [6], for which R(15N/14N)AIR = 0.003677 [5,7,8].  The reported δ15N results have 
been normalized to yield a value of +180 ‰ for RM 8558 (USGS32) [4], where the symbol ‰ is part per thousand 
and is equal to 0.001. 

Expiration  of  Value  Assignment:    RM 8548  is  valid,  within  the  measurement  uncertainty  specified,  until 
31 December 2020 provided the RM is handled in accordance with instructions given in this Report of Investigation 
(see “Instructions for Storage, Handling, and Use”).  This report is nullified if the RM is damaged, contaminated, or 
otherwise modified. 

Maintenance of RM:  NIST will monitor this RM over the period of its validity.  If substantive technical changes 
occur  that  affect  the  value  assignment  before  the  expiration  of  this  report,  NIST  will  notify  the  purchaser.  
Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 

Support and technical aspects of the preparation, analysis, and distribution of this RM was coordinated through the 
NIST Chemical Sciences Division by R.D. Vocke, Jr.

Materials. 

INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE, HANDLING, AND USE 

Storage and Handling:  This RM should be kept in a dry environment as it will attract water when exposed to air.  
To minimize the potential for contamination, it is recommended that this RM be stored in the container in which it is 
supplied. 

Use:  It is recommended that RM 8548 (IAEA-N-2) be used to calibrate or check working laboratory standards that 
are used routinely.  Working laboratory standards with a range of N isotope-ratios can be produced by the methods 
described by Böhlke et al. [9,10]. 

Distribution:  The distribution of RM 8548 (IAEA-N-2) is limited to one unit per customer per three-year period of 
time. 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS  

Preparation:   RM 8547 (IAEA-N-2) was prepared  as  a relatively  coarse  dry  salt by E. Salati (CENA, Piracicaba, 
Sao Paulo, Brazil) between 1978 and 1983 [11,12]. 
 
Analytical Methods:  The reference value for δ15N in RM 8548 (IAEA-N-2) was derived from an inter-laboratory 
comparison test after elimination of outliers [4].  The δ15N values were measured by mass spectrometry on N2 gas 
that  was  quantitatively  produced  using  variants  of  a  buffered  sample  combustion  method  coupled  with  additional 
purification steps.  The measured results were then normalized to yield a value of +180 ‰ for RM 8558 (USGS32). 
 
The δ15N value and expanded uncertainty reported in Table 1 are the values accepted by the Commission on Isotopic 
Abundances  and  Atomic  Weights  of  the  International  Union  of  Pure  and  Applied  Chemistry (IUPAC) 
(http://ciaaw.org/Nitrogen.htm) and the IAEA as of the date of this report. 
 
Isotopic Homogeneity:  There is no evidence of isotopic heterogeneity in this RM for sample sizes in the range of 
10 μmol to 100 μmol of nitrogen [4]. 
 
Normalization of Data:  The δ15N values in samples should be normalized to the AIR-USGS32 scale by calibrating 
the  measurement  with  respect  to  atmospheric  N2 [5]  and  the  δ15N  value  of  the  15N-enriched  anchor, 
RM 8558 (USGS32) [4].    A  general  formula  for  normalizing  nitrogen  isotope  measurement  results  using  two 
laboratory standards LS1 (AIR) and LS2 (USGS32) can be expressed as:

Note:  In  the  above  formulas,  cal  denotes  calibrated  measurements  made  versus  the  AIR–USGS32  scale,  and 
δ15NLS1,cal and δ15NLS2,cal  are the conventionally fixed δ15N values for AIR and USGS32.  WS denotes measurements 
made  versus  a  transfer  gas  (working  standard),  and  δ15N  LS1,WS  and  δ15N  LS2,WS  are  the  δ15N  values  for  calibrated 
laboratory working standards. 
 
Reporting of Nitrogen Stable Isotope δ-values:  The following recommendations from IUPAC are provided for 
reporting δ15N values [5]. It is recommended that: 

 

 

the  value  of  272  be  employed  for  14N/15N  of  N2  in  air  for  the  calculation  of  atom  fraction  15N  from 
measured δ15N values; 
all  δ15N  values  should  be  reported  with  respect  to  air  (atmospheric  nitrogen  gas)  and  normalized  to 
RM 8558 (USGS32). 

In  addition,  researchers  are  encouraged  to  report  the  isotopic  composition  of  RM 8548 (IAEA-N-2)  and  other 
internationally  distributed  nitrogen  isotopic  reference  materials [13]  in  their  publications,  as  appropriate  to  the 
method, as though they have been interspersed among unknowns. 

Current Reports of Investigation (ROI) for all light stable isotopic Reference Materials mentioned in this report are 
available on the SRM web site [14].
