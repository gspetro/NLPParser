This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended primarily for use in validating methods for determining elements, 
r  quality 
arsenic species, vitamin K1, and proximates  in kelp and similar  matrices.  This SRM can also be used for quality 
assurance when assigning values to in-house control materials.  A unit of SRM 3232 consists of three heat-sealed, 
aluminized pouches, each containing approximately 5 g of material. 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values:  The certified mass fraction values reported on a dry-mass basis are provided for 
elements in Table 1.  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in 
that  all  known  or  suspected  sources  of  bias  have  been  investigated  or  taken  into  account [1].    The  certified  mass 
fraction values in this material are the unweighted means of the NIST method means.  The expanded uncertainty is 
calculated as U = kuc, where the combined uncertainty uc incorporates the observed difference between method results, 
the method uncertainties, and an uncertainty component for moisture correction, consistent with the ISO/JCGM Guide 
and its Supplement 1 [2-4].  The coverage factor, k, corresponds to an approximately 95 % level of confidence.  Each 
measurand in Table 1 is the total mass fraction of the element and is metrologically traceable to the SI derived unit of 
milligrams per kilogram on a dry-mass basis. 
 
Reference Mass Fraction Values:  The reference mass fraction values reported on a dry-mass basis are provided for 
the  additional  elements  in  Table 2,  phylloquinone (vitamin K1)  and  arsenic  species  in  Table 3,  and  proximates  in 
Table 4; a reference value for calories on a dry-mass basis is also provided in Table 4.  A NIST reference value is a 
noncertified value that is the best estimate of the true value based on available data; however, the value does not meet 
the  NIST  criteria  for  certification  and  is  provided  with  an  uncertainty  that  may  not  include  all  sources  of 
uncertainty [1].  The reference values are derived from results reported by NIST or collaborating laboratories.  The 
reference  values  are  the  unweighted  means  of  the  NIST  or  collaborator-reported  method  means.    The  expanded 
uncertainty is calculated as U = kuc, where the combined uncertainty uc incorporates the observed difference between 
method results, the method uncertainties, and an uncertainty component for moisture correction, consistent with the 
ISO/JCGM Guide and its Supplement 1 [2-4].  The coverage factor, k, corresponds to an approximately 95 % level of 
confidence.   
 
Information Mass Fraction Value:  The information mass fraction value reported on a dry-mass basis is provided 
for arsenous acid in Table 5.  A NIST information value is considered to be a value that may be of interest to the SRM 
user,  but  insufficient  information  is  available  to  assess  the  uncertainty  associated  with  the  value [1].    Information 
values cannot be used to establish metrological traceability. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 3232 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until  31 December 2026,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  instructions  given  in  this 
certificate (see “Instructions for Storage and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, 
or otherwise modified.

RESEARCH

Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Coordination of the technical measurements leading to the certification of this SRM was performed by L.L. Yu of the 
NIST Chemical Sciences Division. 
 
Support for the development of SRM 3232 was provided in part by the Office of Dietary Supplements of the National 
Institutes of Health (NIH-ODS).  Technical consultation was provided by J.M. Betz (NIH-ODS).  Acquisition and 
preparation of the material were coordinated by K.E. Sharpless of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division. 
 
Analyses  at  NIST  were  performed  by  J.F. Browning,  C.Q. Burdette,  G.C. Caceres,  K.D. Chieh,  W.C. Davis, 
M. Ellisor,  B.L. Kassim,  S.E. Long,  K.E. Murphy,  R. Oflaz,  R.L. Paul,  L.J. Wood,  L.L. Yu,  and  R. Zeisler  of  the 
NIST Chemical Sciences Division. 
 
Statistical analysis was provided by J.H. Yen of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division. 
 
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Office  of  Reference 
Materials. 
 
NOTICE  TO  USERS:    SRM 3232  IS  INTENDED  FOR  RESEARCH  USE;  NOT  FOR  HUMAN  OR  ANIMAL 
CONSUMPTION. 
 
SOURCE AND PREPARATION 
 
The material used to produce the kelp powder (Thallus laminariae) was harvested from the East China Sea when 
the kelp was approximately 6 months old.  The kelp powder was blended and packaged at High-Purity Standards 
(Charleston, SC) into packets.  A packet contains approximately 5 g of kelp powder sealed in a nitrogen flushed plastic 
bag, which was sealed inside a nitrogen-flushed aluminized polyethylene bag with two packets of silica gel.  The 
packets of kelp powder were irradiated at Neutron Products (Dickerson, MD) to absorbed doses of 5.9 kGy to 7.6 kGy, 
and then packaged into units of SRM 3232 at NIST (Gaithersburg, MD). 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE AND USE 
 
Storage:  The SRM should be stored at controlled room temperature (20 °C to 25 °C) in the original unopened packets.  
From the date the packet is opened, the certification is valid for one year for elements, two weeks for arsenic species 
and proximates, and 24 h for vitamin K1 and its isomers, provided that the remaining kelp material is resealed inside 
the plastic bag and the aluminized polyethylene bag, and the resealed packet is stored in controlled room temperature 
of 20 °C to 25 °C. 
 
Use:  Before use, the contents of the packet should be homogenized thoroughly by shaking the packet in the horizontal 
plane for 1 min.  The contents should be allowed to settle for 1 min prior to opening to minimize the loss of fine 
particles.  For certified values to be valid, test portion size should be based on descriptions below (See “Analysis”).  
Examples  of  how  the  measured  values  should  be  evaluated  relative  to  those  in  the  certificate  are  available  in  the 
literature [5].  The reference values of arsenic species in Table 3 and information value of arsenous acid in Table 5 
are  dependent  on  the  extraction  procedures.    The  extraction  procedure  described  in  the  Analysis  section  must  be 
followed to relate the measurement values to the arsenic species values of the certificate. 
 
Correction to a Dry-Mass Basis:  The SRM must be measured as received.  A separate portion of the SRM must be 
used to determine the moisture contents for conversion of the analysis results from as-received to dry-mass basis.  The 
portion of the SRM for moisture analysis must fill the glass weighing vessel to approximately 1 cm in depth and must 
be dried to a constant mass.  The moisture content in mass fraction is calculated as the difference in mass of the test 
portion before and after drying divided by the mass of the test portion before drying.  At NIST, the moisture content 
of SRM 3232 was determined by drying over magnesium perchlorate in a desiccator at room temperature for 28 d and 
by drying in a forced-air oven at 80 °C for 3 h.  The means of the two methods were combined to derive the unweighted 
mean and the expanded uncertainty at approximately 95 % confidence of the dry-mass fraction of (0.9368 ± 0.0015) 
gram per gram of as-received mass.

ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Homogeneity Assessment:  The homogeneity of elements and arsenic species was assessed using the methods and 
test  portion  sizes  described  below.    Analyses  of  variance  and  graphical  analyses  of  the  data  found  no  detectable 
inhomogeneity  at  approximately  95 %  level  of  confidence.    For  the  values  related  to  vitamin  K1,  the  uncertainty 
incorporates a component for possible inhomogeneity based on the standard deviation.  Homogeneity of proximates 
was not assessed, although the data were treated as though the analytes were homogeneous. 
 
Determination of Elements:  Value assignment of the mass fractions of the elements in SRM 3232 was based on 
NIST measurements using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), inductively coupled 
plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), isotope dilution ICP-MS (ID-ICP-MS), isotope dilution cold-vapor generation 
ICP-MS (ID-CV-ICP-MS), and instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA). 
 
ICP-OES and ICP-MS methods:  Mass fractions of calcium, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, potassium, 
sodium, and zinc were measured by ICP-OES.  Mass fractions of arsenic and iodine were measured by ICP-MS.  For 
the determination of all elements except iodine, 0.5 g test portions from either six or ten packets of SRM 3232 were 
digested in a closed-vessel microwave system using nitric acid.  For the determination of iodine, 0.2 g test portions 
from eight packets of SRM 3232 were digested in a closed-vessel microwave system using ammonium hydroxide.  
Quantification  for  all  analyses  was  based  on  the  method  of  standard  additions  using  the  SRM 3100  series  single 
element standard solutions. 
 
ID-CV-ICP-MS method [6]:  The mass fraction of mercury was measured by ID-CV-ICP-MS.  Test portions of 0.25 g 
from  6  packets  were  digested  with  enriched  isotopes  in  a  closed  vessel  microwave  system  using  a  mixture  of 
hydrochloric acid and nitric acid.  The digests were stored in a refrigerator overnight at 4 °C to allow degassing of 
excess nitrogen dioxide and carbon dioxide.  The following day, mercury isotopes were measured in time-resolved 
analysis  mode  using  cold  vapor  generation  coupled  with  ICP-MS.    Quantitative  determinations  are  traceable  to 
SRM 1641d Mercury in Water, a primary standard for mercury. 
 
ID-ICP-MS  methods:    Mass  fractions  of  cadmium,  chromium,  copper,  lead,  and  molybdenum  were  measured  by 
ID-ICP-MS.  For the determination of chromium, copper, and molybdenum, test portions of 0.5 g from 6 packets were 
digested with enriched isotopes in a closed-vessel microwave system using a mixture of hydrofluoric acid and nitric 
acid.  Isotopic measurements were made at mass resolution of approximately 4000 using a sector-field ICP-MS.  For 
the determination of cadmium and lead, test portions of 0.6 g were digested with enriched isotopes in a closed-vessel 
microwave system using a mixture of hydrofluoric acid and nitric acid.  Isotopic measurements were made using a 
quadrupole ICP-MS.  Lead was measured in standard mode, and cadmium was measured in collision cell mode with 
kinetic  energy  discrimination  using  8 %  hydrogen  in  balance  helium  as  collision  gas [7,8].    Quantitative 
determinations are traceable to the SRM 3100 series single element standard solutions. 
 
INAA methods:  Mass fractions of aluminum, arsenic, calcium, chlorine, cobalt, iodine, iron, potassium, magnesium, 
manganese, rubidium, sodium, and zinc were determined by INAA.  Test portions of 0.2 g from 10 packets were made 
into  13 mm  pellets,  sealed  in  linear  polyethylene  bags,  and  irradiated  at  a  reactor  power  of  20 MW.    For  the 
determination of aluminum, calcium, chlorine, iodine, potassium, magnesium, manganese, and sodium, the duration 
of the irradiation was 1 min.  Gamma rays were counted for 5 min to 30 min after a 5 min to 3 h decay.  For the 
determination of arsenic, cobalt, iron, rubidium, and zinc, the duration of the irradiation was 6 h.  Gamma rays were 
counted for 2 h to 8 h after a 5 d to 1 month decay.  Quantitative determinations are traceable to standards prepared 
from  NIST  SRMs  and  standards  prepared  from  high  purity  metals  from  Alfa  Aesar,  Spex  Industries,  or  Aldrich 
Chemicals. 
 
Determination of Vitamin K1:  Value assignment of total vitamin K1 as a sum of trans-vitamin K1 and cis-vitamin K1 
was based on NIST measurements using an isotope dilution liquid chromatography atmospheric pressure chemical 
ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ID-LC-APCI-MS/MS) method.  The ratio of vitamin K1 isomers in SRM 3232 
was determined with the assumption that the instrument response was the same for trans- and cis- isomers. 
 
ID-LC-APCI-MS/MS  method:    The  mass  fractions  of  total  and  isomers  of  vitamin  K1  were  determined  by 
ID-LC-APCI-MS/MS.  Test portions of 2.5 g from 10 packets were transferred into 50 mL polyethylene centrifuge 
tubes containing an appropriate amount of vitamin K1-[2H7] as an internal standard.  For extraction, 30 mL of 30 mg/L 
butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) in hexane was added.  The samples were sonicated in a water bath for 1 h, mixed on 
a  rotary  mixer  at  1 Hz  for  1 h,  centrifuged  at  1400 gn  for  15 min,  and  the  hexane  was  removed  from  the  aqueous 

                                                           

(1)  Certain  commercial  equipment,  instruments  or  materials  are  identified  in  this  certificate  to  adequately  specify  the 
experimental procedure.  Such identification does not imply recommendation or endorsement by the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the purpose.

solution.  Another 30 mL aliquot of hexane was added and the extraction process was repeated three more times.  The 
hexane fractions from the four extraction steps were combined and 1 g magnesium sulfate was added.  The contents 
were  mixed  and  centrifuged.    The  hexane  phase  was  decanted  into  a  drying  vessel,  dried  under  nitrogen,  and  the 
residue was reconstituted in 1 mL of 1:1 volume ratio of ethanol:ethyl acetate that contained 30 mg/L BHT.  The 
separation of vitamin K1 isomers was accomplished by eluting with water:methanol gradient at 0.75 mL/min through 
a  150 mm X 3 mm  C30  column.    The  LC-MS/MS  was  operated  in  positive  ion  mode  and  multiple  reaction 
monitoring (MRM) mode.  The transitions at m/z 451.4 → m/z 187.3 and at m/z 458.4 → m/z 194.4 were monitored 
for vitamin  K1  and vitamin  K1-[2H7],  respectively.    Quantitative  determinations of vitamin  K1  are  traceable  to  the 
molar absorptivity of vitamin K1 [9]. 
 
Determination of Arsenic Species:  Value assignment of the mass fractions of arsenic species in SRM 3232 was 
based on measurements at NIST using liquid chromatography followed by offline INAA determination (LC-INAA) 
and online ICP-MS determination (LC-ICP-MS). 
 
NOTE:  THE EXTRACTION PROCEDURE BELOW MUST BE FOLLOWED TO RELATE THE MEASURED 
VALUES TO THOSE IN THE CERTIFICATE. 
 
Extraction procedure:  Test portions of 1 g from 8 packets were transferred into 15 mL polypropylene test tubes, into 
which  10 mL  of  a  solvent  containing  50 %  volume  fraction  of  methanol  in  water  was  added.    The  contents  were 
vortexed at 40 Hz for 1 min and then allowed to stand on the bench for 2 h at ambient temperature of 21 °C ± 1°C.  
The contents were vortexed at 40 Hz for 30 s and centrifuged at 3600 gn for 30 min.  The supernatant was used for 
speciation measurements by LC-INAA and LC-ICP-MS.  The mass of the extracted arsenic species was calculated as 
the mass concentration of the species in the extract multiplied by the volume of the solvent. 
 
LC-INAA method [10]:  From the above extraction procedure, a 0.9 g aliquot of the extract was diluted in a 2 mL vial 
by  weighing  into  the vial  0.9 mL  water  and  0.2 mL  internal  standard.   A  5 µg/g  monomethylarsonic  acid (MMA) 
solution and a 5 µg/g trimethylarsine oxide (TMAO) solution were used as the internal standards for separation by 
anion exchange and cation exchange, respectively.  A 50 µL aliquot of the extract containing the internal standard was 
injected  onto  a  cation  exchange  or  an  anion  exchange  LC  column  and  eluted  under  isocratic  conditions  using 
30 mmol/L pyridine at pH 3.0 and 20 mmol/L ammonium carbonate at pH 9.0, respectively.  Arsenic species were 
quantitatively collected in the fractions of the eluent.  The solvent of each fraction was evaporated at 75 °C under a 
stream of nitrogen.  The residue was reconstituted in water and quantitatively transferred to a filter paper, which was 
dried under an infrared lamp and pressed into a pellet for measurement using a procedure similar to the INAA methods 
described  above.    Quantitative  determinations  are  traceable  to  standards  prepared  from  SRM 3103a  Arsenic (As) 
Standard Solution. 
 
LC-ICP-MS method:  From the above extraction procedure, a 0.9 g aliquot of the extract was diluted in a 2 mL vial 
by weighing into the vial 0.9 mL of water and 0.2 mL of 5 µg/g TMAO solution serving as an internal standard.  A 
0.5 g aliquot of the resulting solution was diluted to 2 g with water to form a measurement sample.  A 1 g aliquot of 
the measurement sample solution was spiked with a 0.3 g standard containing 95 ng/g arsenosugar 328 and 30 ng/g 
dimethylarsinic acid (DMA).  An unspiked sample was prepared by mixing 1 g of the measurement sample with 0.3 g 
water.    The  spiked  and  the  unspiked  kelp  extract  samples  were  analyzed  for  arsenous  acid,  DMA,  TMAO,  and 
arsenosugar 328  by  cation  exchange  LC-ICP-MS  using  30 mmol/L  pyridine  in  a  gradient  elution  method [11].  
Quantitative determinations are traceable to standards prepared from SRM 3103a Arsenic (As) Standard Solution and 
SRM 83d Arsenic Trioxide (As2O3) Reductometric Standard. 
 
Determination of Proximates:  The results for proximates were provided by Covance Laboratories (Madison, WI) 
and National Food Lab (Livermore, CA).  The measurement methods for proximates are referenced in the footnote of 
Table 4.
