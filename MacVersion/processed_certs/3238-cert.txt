This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended primarily for validation of methods for determining isoflavones 
in solid oral dosage forms containing soy and in similar matrices.  This SRM can also be used for quality assurance 
when assigning values to in-house reference materials.  A unit of SRM 3238 consists of 5 packets, each containing 
approximately 2.6 g of material. 
 
The  development  of  SRM 3238  was  a  collaboration  between  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and 
Technology (NIST) and the National Institutes of Health, Office of Dietary Supplements (NIH-ODS). 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values:  The certified mass fraction values of isoflavones (aglycones and total glycosides) 
in SRM 3238 are provided in Table 1.  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence 
ySes 
in its accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [1].  Analyses 
equally  weighted 
for  value  assignment  were  performed  by  NIST,  and  certified  values  were  calculated  as  the  equally  weighted  
mean  of  the  mean  values  from  NIST  methods.    The  associated  uncertainties  are  expressed  at  the  95 %  level  of 
confidence [2–4].  Values are reported on a dry-mass basis in mass fraction units [5]. 
 
Reference Mass Fraction Values: The reference mass fraction value for daidzin is provided in Table 2.  Reference 
values are noncertified values that are the best estimate of the true values based on available data; however, the values 
do not meet the NIST criteria for certification [1] and are provided with associated uncertainties that may reflect only 
measurement reproducibility, may not include all sources of uncertainty, or may reflect a lack of sufficient statistical 
agreement among multiple analytical methods.  
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 3238 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until 15 December 2020, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given in this 
certificate (see “Instructions for Storage and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, 
or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
icate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Support for the development of SRM 3238 was provided in part by NIH-ODS.  Technical consultation was provided by 
J.M. Betz of NIH-ODS.

NOTICE AND WARNING TO USERS 
 
SRM 3238 IS INTENDED FOR LABORATORY USE ONLY, NOT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE AND USE 
 
Storage:  The original unopened packets of SRM 3238 should be stored at controlled room temperature (20 °C to 
the 
25 °C).  Once the packet is opened, the long-term stability of all analytes in SRM 3238 is unknown.  Therefore, the 
is  used
l  use  and  the  same  results  are  not  guarantee 
certification only applies to the initial use and the same results are not guaranteed if the remaining powder is used 
longer than two months after opening. 
 
Use:  Prior to removal of a test portion for analysis, the contents of a packet of material should be mixed thoroughly.  
For certified values to be valid, a test portion of at least 100 mg should be used; the homogeneity of test portions less 
than 100 mg has not been evaluated.  Results obtained in analyses should include their own estimates of uncertainty 
and  can  be  compared  to  the  certified  values  using  procedures  described  in  reference 6.    Test  portions  should  be 
analyzed as received and results converted to a dry-mass basis by determining moisture content (see “Determination 
of Moisture”) on a separate test portion. 
 
SOURCE, PREPARATION, AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Source and Preparation:  SRM 3238 was prepared from several different commercially available tablets that were 
purchased in the marketplace.  The tablets were ground using a Teflon disc mill at room temperature and sieved to 
180 µm (80 mesh).  The powdered materials were transferred to High-Purity Standards (Charleston, SC) where they 
were  blended,  aliquoted,  and heat-sealed  inside  nitrogen-flushed  4 mil  polyethylene  bags,  which  were  then  sealed 
inside  nitrogen-flushed  aluminized  plastic  bags  along  with  two  packets  of  silica  gel  each.    Following  packaging, 
SRM 3238 was irradiated (Neutron Products, Inc., Dickerson, MD) to an absorbed dose of 8.0 kGy to 10.0 kGy. 
 
NIST  Analyses  for  Isoflavones  Using  Isotope  Dilution  Liquid  Chromatography  with  Mass  Spectrometric 
(ID-LC/MS) Detection:  Daidzein, daidzin, genistein, genistin, glycitein, and glycitin were measured at NIST using 
ID-LC/MS.  Calibrants were prepared gravimetrically, at levels intended to approximate the levels of the isoflavones 
in the SRM.  Internal standards were employed; a single solution was used for the calibrants and samples.  Duplicate 
50 mg test portions of powder from each of 6 packets were accurately weighed into 15 mL polyethylene centrifuge 
tubes.    An  aliquot  of  a  mixed  internal  standard  solution  containing  13C6-daidzin,  13C6-daidzein,  13C6-genistein,  
13C6-genistin, 13C6-glycitein, and 13C6-glycitin was added.  Analytes were extracted from the sample, then hydrolyzed 
to convert acetyl- and malonyl-glycosides to free glycosides, neutralized, diluted, and centrifuged prior to injection.  
Details of the separation and a typical chromatogram are provided in Figure 1.  The separation was monitored using 
an absorbance detector at 260 nm, but MS was used for quantitation.  Daidzein and 13C6-daidzein were monitored at 
m/z 255 and m/z 261, respectively.  Daidzin and 13C6-daidzin were monitored at m/z 417 and m/z 423, respectively.  
Genistein and 13C6-genistein were monitored at m/z 271 and m/z 277, respectively.  Genistin and 13C6-genistin were 
monitored at m/z 433 and m/z 439, respectively.  Glycitein and 13C6-glycitein were monitored at m/z 285 and m/z 291, 
respectively.  Glycitin and 13C6-glycitin were monitored at m/z 447 and m/z 453, respectively. 
 
NIST Analyses  for  Isoflavones  Using  Liquid  Chromatography  with Absorbance (LC/absorbance)  Detection:  
Daidzein, daidzin, genistein, genistin, glycitein, and glycitin were measured at NIST using LC/absorbance.  Calibrants 
were prepared gravimetrically, at levels intended to approximate the levels of the isoflavones in the SRM.  An internal 
standard  approach  was  utilized  with  a  single  solution  used  for  the  calibrants  and  samples.    Duplicate  100 mg  test 
portions of powder from each of 10 packets were accurately weighed into 15 mL polyethylene centrifuge tubes.  An 
aliquot of an internal standard solution containing sissotrin was added.  Analytes were extracted from the sample, then 
hydrolyzed to convert acetyl- and malonyl-glycosides to free glycosides, neutralized, diluted, and centrifuged prior to 
injection.    Details  of  the  separation  and  a  typical  chromatogram  are  provided  in  Figure 2.    The  separation  was 
monitored and quantitation performed using an absorbance detector at 254 nm. 
 

 

                                                           

(1) Certain  commercial  equipment,  instruments  or  materials  are  identified  in  this  certificate  to  adequately  specify  the 
experimental procedure.  Such identification does not imply recommendation or endorsement by the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the purpose.

Determination of Moisture:  Moisture content of SRM 3238 was determined at NIST (see “Instructions for Storage 
and Use”) by (1) freeze drying to constant mass over 8 d; (2) drying over magnesium perchlorate in a desiccator at 
room temperature for 26 d; and (3) drying for 2 h in a forced air oven at 80 °C.  The results obtained using all three 
techniques were averaged to determine a conversion factor of (0.973 ± 0.002) gram dry mass per gram as-received 
mass, which was used to convert data from an as-received to a dry-mass basis; the uncertainty shown on this value is 
an expanded uncertainty.  An uncertainty component for the conversion factor (0.1 %) obtained from the moisture 
measurements  is  incorporated  in  the  uncertainties  of  the  certified  values,  reported  on  a  dry-mass  basis,  that  are 
provided  in  this  certificate.    Users  of  this  material  may  use  any  single  method  described  above  to  determine  the 
moisture content on test portions.  
 
Homogeneity Assessment:  The homogeneity of isoflavones in the SRM was assessed at NIST using the methods 
and  test  portion  sizes  described  above  and  analyses  of  variance  with  5 %  significance  level;  because  of  possible 
inhomogeneity, an uncertainty component for heterogeneity is incorporated in the combined uncertainty of each value. 
 
Value Assignment:  The equally weighted mean of NIST results provided by LC/absorbance and ID-LC/MS were 
used to calculate assigned values. 
 
Certified  Mass  Fraction  Values  for  Isoflavones:    Each  certified  mass  fraction  value  is  the  mean  from  the 
combination of the mean results provided by LC/absorbance and ID-LC/MS by NIST.  The uncertainty provided with 
each value is an expanded uncertainty about the mean to cover the measurand with approximately 95 % confidence.  
The expanded uncertainty is calculated as U = kuc, where uc incorporates the observed difference between the results 
from the methods and their respective uncertainties, and uncertainty components related to moisture correction and to 
possible inhomogeneity, consistent with the ISO/JCGM Guide and with its Supplement 1, and k is a coverage factor 
corresponding  to  approximately  95 %  confidence [2–4].  The  measurands  are  the  mass  fractions  of  isoflavones  in 
soy-containing  solid  oral  dosage  form.    The  certified  values  are  metrologically  traceable  to  the  SI  unit  of  mass, 
expressed as milligrams per kilogram.
