Standard Reference Material® 2133 

 
Phosphorus Implant in Silicon Depth Profile Standard 

the  analytical

This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  intended  for  use  in  calibrating  secondary  ion  response  to  minor  and 
trace 
ion  mass 
spectrometry (SIMS).  SRM 2133 is intended for calibrating the response of a SIMS instrument for phosphorus in a 
silicon  matrix  under  a  specific  set  of  instrumental  conditions.    It  may  also  be  used  by  a  laboratory  as  a  transfer 
standard  for  the  calibration  of  working  standards  of  phosphorus  in  silicon.    This  SRM  consists  of  a  1 cm × 1 cm 
single crystal silicon substrate that has been ion-implanted with the isotope 31P at a nominal energy of 100 keV. 
 
SRM 2133 is certified for the retained dose of  31P atoms.  The dose is expressed in units of phosphorus mass per 
unit area.  Additional non-certified information about the concentration of phosphorus atoms as a function of depth 
below the surface is provided based on SIMS analysis. 
 
Certified Value and Uncertainty:  The total retained dose of 31P atoms was determined by radiochemical neutron 
activation analysis (RNAA).  Aliquots of two independently prepared phosphorus reference solutions (one of which 
was  NIST  SRM 3139a  Phosphorus  Standard  Solution,  certified  for  phosphorus  concentration)  were  deposited  on 
aluminum foils and served as standards.  The resulting certified value and expanded uncertainty are: 
 
 
 
Using a value of 30.97376 g/mol for the isotopic mass of 31P, the retained dose is equivalent to: 
 

Certified Retained dose of 31P:   0.04927 g/cm2    0.00083 g/cm2 

9.58 × 1014 atoms/cm2    0.16 × 1014 atoms/cm2 

 
The uncertainty in the certified value is expressed as an expanded uncertainty U = kuc, where k is a coverage factor 
of 2.0 giving an approximate level of confidence of 95 %, and uc is the combined standard uncertainty calculated 
according  to  the  ISO  Guide [1].    The  combined  standard  uncertainty  is  obtained  by  combining  the  individual 
standard uncertainties derived or estimated from the measurement process by propagation of uncertainties [1].  The 
Type  A  and  Type  B  standard  uncertainty  components  arise  from  measurement  uncertainties  in  the  following 
principal  sources:    (1)  measurement  replication  and  heterogeneity  for  samples,  (2)  measurement  replication  for 
comparator  standards,  (3)  concentrations  of  standard  solutions,  (4)  radiochemical  impurities,  (5)  volumetric 
calibrations  of standards, and (6) determination of carrier yield.  All known potential sources of uncertainty have 
been considered [2-4].  
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 2133 is valid indefinitely, within the uncertainty specified, 
provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  given  in  this  certificate  (see 
“Instructions for Handling, Storage and Use”).  Accordingly, periodic recalibration or recertification of this SRM is 
not required.  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance  of  SRM  Certification:    NIST  will  monitor  this  SRM  over  the  period  of  its  certification.    If 
substantive technical changes occur that affect the certification before the expiration of this certificate, NIST will 
notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
The  overall  direction  and  coordination  of  the  technical  measurements  leading  to  certification  were  performed  by 
D.S. Simons of the NIST Surface and Microanalysis Science Division.

Statistical  analysis  was  performed  by  W.F. Guthrie  and  J. Lu  of  the  NIST  Statistical  Engineering  Division  and 
R.L. Paul, with assistance from R.R. Greenberg of the NIST Analytical Chemistry Division. 
 
The ion implantation for this SRM was carried out under the direction of L. Rubin of Axcelis Technologies1.   
 
Radiochemical  neutron  activation  analysis (RNAA)  and  data  reduction  were  performed  by  R.L. Paul  of  the  NIST 
Analytical Chemistry Division.   
 
Secondary ion mass spectrometry measurements were performed by P.H. Chi and D.S. Simons of the NIST Surface 
and Microanalysis Science Division and by C.W. Magee of Evans East. 
 
Cleaning and packaging were performed by D.S. Simons of the NIST Surface and Microanalysis Science Division.   
 
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the NIST Measurement Services 
Division. 
 
Production  and  Physical  Description:    The  starting  material  consisted  of  a  commercial  200 mm  p-type  silicon 
(100) single crystal wafer polished on one side.  The polished side of the silicon wafer was implanted with 31P ions 
at  a  nominal  energy  of  100 keV  in  an  ion  implanter.  The  wafer  was  nominally  at  room  temperature  during  the 
implantation.  The wafer was cut into 1 cm  1 cm squares with a wafer saw.  All squares were located at least 1 cm 
from the edge of the wafer.   
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE AND USE 
 
Handling:    The  implanted  side  of  the  SRM  is  the  polished,  reflective  side.    This  surface  was  cleaned  prior  to 
packaging.  Immediately prior to use, dust particles should be removed from the surface with a pressurized duster. 
 
Etching the sample in hydrofluoric acid is NOT recommended because some phosphorus may be removed with the 
surface oxide.  
 
Storage:  When not in use the SRM should be stored in its original tray with the cover secured tightly. 
 
Use:  Information on material composition as a function of depth can be obtained with SIMS by monitoring one or 
more  sputtered  ion  species  as  successive  layers  are  removed  by  ion  bombardment.    The  concentration  value  of  a 
species is normally calibrated with a reference sample of the same species in the same matrix as the unknown [5,6]. 
  
 
SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION 
 
The  usefulness  of  this  SRM  for  calibrating  the  SIMS  response  function  of  31P  in  silicon  depends  on  maintaining 
constant analysis conditions during the acquisition of the SIMS depth profile.  Care must be taken to ensure that the 
primary ion beam current remains stable and the beam raster location remains fixed. 
 
The  energy  of  the  ion  implanter  was  not  calibrated.    Caution  should  therefore  be  exercised  in  comparing  the 
experimental parameters from the SIMS profile with theoretical predictions of implantation models. 
 
The  functional  form  of  the  concentration  versus  depth  of  31P  in  this  material  was  measured  by  SIMS  under 
3 keV Cs+ bombardment at an angle of 60 to the surface normal and with  31P- detection. SIMS depth-profile data 
taken with a quadrupole mass spectrometer are plotted in Figure 1. 
 
The lateral variation of the implanted dose was tested by sheet resistance mapping of a companion wafer that was 
implanted in the same batch as the one used for this SRM.  This measurement showed a relative standard deviation 
of  0.43 %  of  the  mean  sheet  resistance  over  81  analysis  points.    The  sample-to-sample  variation  of  phosphorus 
content that was observed during the neutron activation analysis measurements was modeled as a function of sample 
location.  The uncertainty in the certified value takes into account the observed heterogeneity among samples. 
                                                 

1  Certain  commercial  equipment,  instruments,  or  materials  are  identified  in  this  certificate  to  adequately  specify  the 
experimental  procedure.  Such  identification  does  not  imply  recommendation  or  endorsement  by  the  National  Institute  of 
Standards and Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the 
purpose.
