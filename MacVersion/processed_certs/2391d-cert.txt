Standard Reference Material 2391d 

 

 

 
PCR-Based DNA Profiling Standard 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended primarily for use in the standardization of forensic and paternity 
quality  assurance  procedures  for  polymerase  chain  reaction (PCR)-based  genetic  testing,  for  instructional  law 
enforcement or non-clinical research purposes, and for quality assurance when assigning values to in-house control 
materials.    It  is  not  intended  for  any  human  or  animal  clinical  diagnostic  use.    This  SRM  is  composed  of 
well-characterized human deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in two forms; genomic DNA (Components A through D) and 
DNA  to  be  extracted  from  cells  that  have  been  spotted  onto  FTA paper (Component E).    The  complete  listing  of 
Components  is  included  in  Table 1.    A  unit  of  SRM 2391d  is  composed  of  one  vial  of  each  of  five  components 
packaged together in one box. 
 
Certified Values:  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that 
all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [1].  The certified values for the 
components in SRM 2391d were derived from a combination of Capillary Electrophoresis (CE) and Next Generation 
Sequencing (NGS)-based  characterizations  that  allowed  for  the  counting  and  direct  sequencing  of  short  tandem 
repeats (STRs) at a locus.  High confidence allele calls were established by using multiple PCR-based STR typing kits 
and NGS-based kits and technologies. The STR allele calls certified in SRM 2391d are traceable to the natural unit 
count one by virtue of counting the number of repeat units through the analysis of CE and NGS data [2].  Tables 2 
and 3 list CE and NGS-based methods used for characterization of the autosomal STR loci, Y-STR loci, and X-STR 
loci.   
 
Table 4  lists  genotypes  for  35 Certified  autosomal  STR  loci  plus  the  sex-typing  locus  Amelogenin.    Table 5  lists 
Certified haplotypes for 28 Certified Y-STR loci.  Table 6 lists Certified genotypes/haplotypes for seven X-STR loci. 
 
Information  Values:    A  NIST  Information  Value  is  data  that  may  be  of  interest  and  use  to  the  SRM  user,  but 
insufficient information is available to assess the highest confidence of the assignment [1].  Information Values have 
been assigned to the DNA concentrations of Components A through D (Table 1), the number of cells per paper punch 
of  Component E  (Table 1),  and  the  genotypes/haplotypes  (when  typed  exclusively  with  CE  methods)  of  the  five 
Components at 13 autosomal STR loci (Table 7), three Y-STR loci (Table 8), five X-STR loci (Table 9), 30 Insertion 
and Deletion (Indel) loci (Table 10), and 20 Insertion and Null allele (INNUL) loci (Table 11).  Information Values 
are also assigned to 101 autosomal identity single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci, 34 Y-SNP loci, 188 autosomal 
ancestry  and  phenotype  SNP  loci,  and  whole  mitochondrial  genome  DNA (mtDNA)  sequences  determined  by 
sequencing. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 2391d is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until  04 June 2024,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  given  in  this 
certification  (see  “Instructions  for  Use”).    The  certification  is  nullified  if  the  SRM  is  damaged,  contaminated,  or 
otherwise modified. 
 
Overall  direction  and  coordination  of  the  technical  activities  leading  to  certification  were  under  the  leadership  of 
C.R. Steffen of the NIST Biomolecular Measurement Division. 
 
Analytical determinations and technical measurements leading to the certification of this SRM were performed by 
E.L. Romsos,  A. Tona,  L.A. Borsuk,  K.M. Kiesler,  S. Riman,  and  K.B. Gettings  of  the  NIST  Biomolecular 
Measurement and Biosystems and Biomaterials Divisions. 
 
Statistical consultation was provided by H.K. Iyer of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division.

Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
‘icate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
through  the  NIST  Office  of  Reference
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Office  of  Reference 
Materials. 
 
NOTICE AND WARNINGS TO USER 
 
Warning:  SRM 2391d components are human source materials.  The suppliers of the source materials used to prepare 
this  product  found  the  materials  to  be  non-reactive  when  tested  for  hepatitis B  surface  antigen (HBsAg),  human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus 1 antigen (HIV-1Ag) 
by  Food  and  Drug  Administration (FDA)  licensed  tests.    However,  because  no  test  method  can  offer  complete 
assurance that HIV, hepatitis viruses, or other infectious agents are absent, this SRM should be handled at the Biosafety 
Level 1  for  any  potentially  infectious  human  serum  or  blood  specimen [3].    SRM 2391d  components  and  derived 
solutions should be disposed of in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations. 
 
Storage:  Store refrigerated at a temperature range of 2 ºC to 8 ºC (do not freeze). 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 
 
Vials for Components A through D should be briefly vortexed and centrifuged prior to opening.  After opening the 
vials, sample aliquots for analysis should be withdrawn immediately and processed without delay for the certified 
values to be applicable.  Component E, cells on FTA paper, should be washed to reduce PCR inhibitors and salts prior 
to PCR amplification. 
 
SOURCE AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Source of Material:  The human genomic DNA extracts prepared at NIST for Components A through C were derived 
from  buffy  coat  white  blood  cells  from  single  source  anonymous  donors  under  the  approval  of  the  NIST  Human 
Subjects Protection Office.  The cell line used for Component E was obtained from American Type Culture Collection 
(Manassas, VA) under license and material transfer agreements.  All source materials have been tested and found 
negative for HBsAg, HIV, HCV, and HIV-1Ag before use. 
 
Interlaboratory Study:  Four laboratories participated in the characterization of the material comprising SRM 2391d 
including  Promega  Corporation  (Madison, WI),  Qiagen  (Germantown, MD),  Verogen  (San  Diego, CA),  and  the 
Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory (AFDIL) (Dover, DE).   
 
Description of Components:  Five components are included in each unit.  Components A through D each contain 
55 µL of extracted genomic DNA in TE-4 buffer, pH 8.0, and are packaged in perfluoroalkoxy fluoropolymer (PFA) 
vials.  Table 1 lists the DNA concentration and expanded uncertainty for the Components based upon results from 
droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR).  Component E contains two 6 mm punches of FTA paper.  Each 
punch was prepared to hold approximately 7.5 × 104 cells.  Component E is packaged in sterile 0.5 mL polypropylene 
vials.  A detailed description of the individual components in SRM 2391d is listed in Table 1.  Note that SRM 2391d 
is  modified from SRM 2391c in that Components A through D are different samples with different profiles; however, 
Component E remains the same. 

                                                           
(1)Certain  commercial  equipment,  instruments  or  materials  are  identified  in  this  certificate  to  adequately  specify  the 
 
experimental procedure.  Such identification does not imply recommendation or endorsement by the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the purpose.
