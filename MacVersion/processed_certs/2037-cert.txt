Solvent Red 24 Diesel Fuel Dye 
 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended for the verification and calibration of spectrophot ometers used 
to measure the concentration of Solvent Red dyes employed as colorants to mark “off-road” diesel fuel.  SRM 2037 
is certified for the purity of the Solvent Red 24 Dye (C
24H20N4O, molecular mass 380.45) and for the second-
derivative-based molecular absorption coefficients (extinc tion coefficients) of solutions of Solvent Red 24 Dye in 
p-xylene and in 97:3 (v:v) kerosene:
screw-capped bottle containing approximately 100 mg of solid Solvent Red 24 Dye. 
 
Certified Values:   A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST  has the highest confid ence in its accuracy and 
that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or accounted for by NIST [1].  The certified mass 
fraction (purity) of the Solvent Red 24 dye is given in Table 1.  The certified second-derivative-
based molecular 
absorption coefficients, defined as  ∆D2 / bc, which corresponds to an absorption coefficient based on second 
derivative absorbance spectra, where  ∆D2 is the difference between the local  maximum and local minimum second 
e concentration, for 
derivative absorbance values at the wavelengths given in Table 2, b is the pathlength and c is th
solutions of SRM 2037 at a 95 % uncertainty interval (at 22.5 °C  ±  0.5 °C) are listed in Table 2.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 
 
CAUTION:   Solvent Red 24 has been   designated a possible mutagen   and is a common biological colorant for
 
staining lipids and fatty substances in cells and tissues.  Proper hand and eye protection should always  be used when 
e amounts of the solid dye 
handling this SRM.  The material and its solutions are intensely red and nearly invisibl
can stain clothing, equipment, etc. if handled improperly.  Any unused material should be discarded properly
 (see 
the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) accompanying the SRM. 
 
This material is not hydroscopic under the normal conditions of storage as described above and can be used without  
preliminary drying. 
 
This material is not easily dissolved in aliphatic hydro
preparation of such solutions, dissolution of a weighed amount of the solid dye in a small amount
hydrocarbon (e.g., toluene or xylene in which it is more soluble) followed by dilution with the aliphatic material is 
suggested.  
 
Software routines for calculating second derivative spectra often contain magnitude scaling factors [4
Furthermore, the type and amount of spectral smoothing used when determining the second derivatives can affect 

carbons (e.g., kerosene or di

esel fuel).  To facilitate

the solvent and temperature.   Steric factors argue for the  E-configurations about the nitrogen double bounds, but  1H

expanded uncertainties given in this cer tificate express an interval within which the true value is expected to fall 
with a level of confidence of approximately 95 % [2].  The uncertainty of the purity of the Solven
t Red 24 was 
handled differently because for any mate rial the upper limit for purity is 100  %.  Accordingly, a Baysian approach 
was used that distributes the calculated combined uncertainty density uniformly across the constrained mass fraction 
range to give an unsymmetrical interval bounded by 100 %  within which the true value is expected to fall with a 
level of confidence of approximately 95 % [3]. 
 
SRM Stability:   NIST has monitored the stability of solutions of prototype materials similar to SRM 2037 for over 
36 months.    Within the error of the measurem ents, the absorbance spectrum of the prototype solutions did not 
change, providing the solutions were stored in the dark.   Exposure of solutions of Solvent Red 24 and similar dyes 
to sunlight or other sources of ultraviolet light causes slow fading of the red color and a decrease in the mo
lecular 
absorption coefficient due to photochemical decomposition of the dye itself.  No specific photostability studies have 
been carried out on the solid dye, but given the solution results, it seems prudent to store the SRM in its original 
amber container in the dark.    SRM 2037, if stored tightly re-capped, in the dark between 15 
likely maintain its original optical properties for the duration of its certification period and perhaps beyond that. 
NIST will validate this conclusion by periodic monitoring of the stability over the time the lifetime of the SRM.
