Standard Reference Material 2389a 
 
Amino Acids in 0.1 mol/L Hydrochloric Acid 

 
This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  use  in  calibration  of  chromatographic 
instrumentation for the determination of amino acids.  SRM 2389a is a solution of amino acids in a 0.1 mol/L aqueous 
solution of hydrochloric acid.  A unit of SRM 2389a consists of five 2-mL ampoules, each containing approximately 
1.2 mL of the solution under argon. 
 
Certified Concentrations of Amino Acids:  The certified concentrations and estimated uncertainties for the 16 amino 
acids provided in Table 1 are based on the results obtained from the gravimetric preparation of the solutions and from 
the  analytical  results  determined  using  liquid  chromatography-tandem  mass  spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).    A  NIST 
certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that all known or suspected 
sources  of  bias  have  been  investigated  or  taken  into  account [1].    Values  are  provided  in  mass  fraction  units 
(milligrams per gram), and, for user convenience, in amount-of-substance concentrations (millimoles per liter) [2].  
The  amount-of-substance  concentrations  were  calculated  from  the  mass  fraction  values  using  the  density  of  the 
solution determined at 20 °C (g/mL) and the relative molecular masses of each amino acid.  An allowance for the 
change in density over the range 18 °C to 23 °C is included in the uncertainty. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 2389a is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until 01 January 2024, provided the SRM is handled in accordance with the instructions given in this certificate (see 
“Instructions for Handling, Storage, and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, 
or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Coordination  of  the  technical  measurements  leading  to  certification  was  under  the  direction  of  D.M. Bunk, 
M.S. Lowenthal, and K.W. Phinney of the NIST Biomolecular Measurement Division.   
 
Preparation  of  the  SRM  solution  was  performed  in  the  NIST  Chemical  Sciences  Division  by  L.T. Sniegoski  and 
M.J. Welch.    Analytical  measurements  were  performed  by  B.S Benford,  formerly  of  NIST,  M.S. Lowenthal,  and 
B.E. Lang of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division.   
 
Statistical consultations on the experimental design and the evaluation of the data were provided by J.H. Yen of the 
NIST Statistical Engineering Division.

(a)  The results are expressed as the certified value ± the expanded uncertainty.  Each result is the average of the gravimetric and 
the LC-MS/MS means.  The uncertainty provided with each value is an expanded uncertainty about the mean to cover the 
measurand with approximately 95 % confidence: it expresses both the observed difference between the results from the methods 
and their respective uncertainties, incorporating uncertainty components for purity correction and gravimetry, consistently with 
the ISO/JCGM Guide and with its Supplement 1 [3-5].  The certified values are metrologically traceable to the SI-derived unit 
for mass fraction (expressed as milligrams per gram). 

(b)  The amount-of-substance concentrations (mmol/L) were obtained by multiplying the certified values in mass fraction units by 
the density of the solution at 20 °C (1.00123 g/mL) and dividing by the relative molecular masses of each of the compounds.  
These concentrations are for use in the temperature range of 18 °C to 23 °C, and an allowance for the change in density over 
this temperature range is included in the Type B components of uncertainty. 

INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
Handling:  This material contains 0.1 mol/L hydrochloric acid and should be handled with care.  Use proper disposal 
methods. 
 
Storage:  Sealed ampoules, as received, should be stored in the dark at approximately 4 °C. 
 
Use:  Prior to removal of the test portion for analysis, the contents of an ampoule of material should be allowed to warm 
to room temperature (18 °C to 23 °C).  Test portions for use should be withdrawn immediately after opening the ampoules 
and should be processed or diluted without delay for the certified concentration to be valid within the stated uncertainty.  
The certified concentration values listed in Table 1 apply only to aliquots removed at 18 °C to 23 °C. 
 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
re  of  the  highest  purity  available  and
Preparation of Material:  All chemicals used in the preparation of this SRM were of the highest purity available and 
were obtained from a commercial source.  The amino acid solution was prepared by weighing the individual amino acids, 
concentrated HCl, and water and mixing until the amino acids were completely dissolved.  The total mass of this solution 
was measured.  The concentration of each amino acid was calculated using the measured density of the 0.1 mol/L HCl 
solution at 20 °C of 1.00123 g/mL.  Corrections were made to the calculated amino acid concentrations based on purity 
as determined by LC with absorbance detection with confirmatory data provided by the manufacturer.  The purity of each 
amino acid was also evaluated by elemental analysis at Galbraith Laboratories (Knoxville, TN).  Moisture content for all 
amino acids was determined using Karl Fischer titration at Galbraith Laboratories and for lysine at NIST.  Arginine and 

                                                 

(1)  Certain  commercial  equipment,  instruments,  or  materials  are  identified  in  this  report  to  specify  adequately  the 
experimental procedure.  Such identification does not imply recommendation or endorsement by the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the purpose.

the 
lysine contained measurable levels of water and values were corrected; correction for moisture was not necessary for the 
remaining amino acids.   
 
The bulk solution was dispensed in 1.2 mL aliquots into argon-flushed 2-mL amber ampoules that were then flame sealed 
and stored in numbered boxes at ≈4 oC.  
 
LC-MS/MS  Measurements:    Three  aliquots  from  four  randomly  selected  ampoules  were  analyzed  in  duplicate  by 
LC-MS/MS on a SIELC (Prospect Heights, IL) Primesep 100 mixed-mode LC column.  Chromatographic separation 
was  performed  using  microflow  liquid  chromatography  coupled  in-line  to  a  triple  quadrupole  mass  spectrometer 
equipped with a standard source.  Data were acquired through selected-reaction monitoring of amino acid precursor-
to-product ion transitions.  Unique isotopically-labeled internal standards were used for quantification of each amino 
acid.  Internal standards and calibrants were prepared gravimetrically in 0.1 mol/L HCl as stock solutions and were further 
diluted gravimetrically to working concentrations.  Internal standards were mixed gravimetrically with calibrants and 
were measured quantitatively by LC-MS/MS to determine the calibration curves.  The same internal standard solution 
was mixed with aliquots of SRM 2389a and was analyzed in an identical manner.  Mass ratios of SRM 2389a were 
determined  by  interpolation  of  integrated  peak  area  ratios  through  calibration  curves  created  from  multiple  reaction 
monitoring analysis of the calibrants.
