Linerboard  Standard  for  Tape  Adhesion  Testing 

This  Standard  Reference  Material  (SRM)  is  intewed  to  provide  aumifbrn  source  oflmerboanl  for  use  with  ASTM  D  2840  Standard 
It  may  also  be 
Test  Method  for  Adhesion  of  Pressure-Sensitve  Tape  to  Fiberboard  at  90  Degree  Angle  and  Constant  Stress  [1]. 

used  for  the  folowing  ASTM  test  methods:  ASTM  D  3554  Standard  Test  Method  for  Holdmg  Power  of  Pressare-Senstive  Tapes 
[2],  ASTM  D  3889  Standard  Test  Method  for  Adherence  to  Lmetboard  of  Pressure  -Sansitve  Tape  at  Low  Temperate  [3]. 

Each  wit  of  this  SRM  consists  of  fifty  21.6  om  x  28  on  (8  '&  mx  11]  in)  Inerboard  sheets  of  Mosmee  696-C!'  paper,  sealed  in  a 
moisture  resistant  foil-lmed  package. 

Based  on  avalable  ASTM  Comuuttee  D-10  test  informahon,  two  test  resilts  (each  based  on  fire  specimens  -  using  tape  fiom  the 
same  roll  and  tested  in  accordance  with  Procedure  A  of D  2860)  should  agree  with  each  other  within  50%  of  the  average  test  result 

at  least  94  %  of  the  tre.

Expiration  of  Certification:  The  certification  of  an  unopened  package  of  this $RM  is  deemed  to  be  indefinte,  provided the  SRM 
is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  the  Care  and  Handling  and  Instracticns  for  Use  sections  of  this  certificate.  However, 
certification  willbe  mulbfied  ffhe  SRM  is  damaged,  contanmated,  or  exposed  to  excess  lnowadihy.  Indo-adhal  sheets,  once  wed,  cannot 
be  retested. 

Certification  of  the  Imerboard  is  based  on  anabysis  and  information  developed  by  the  Tape  Task  Group  of  ASTM  Committee  D-10 
on  Packaging  and  Subcorurttee  D10.14  on  Tapes  and  Labels.

INSTRUCTIONS  FOR  USING  SRM  18104 

With  ASTM  Designation  D  2360,  Procedure  A 
Adhesion  of  Pressure-Sensitive  T  ape  to  Fiberbo  ard  at  90  Degree  Angle  and  Constant  Stress 

Care  and  Handhmeg:  SRM  18104,  Linettoard  is  isned  in  sealed  packages.  Open  the  sealed  package  only  m  a  room  mantamed 
in  aceordance  with  ecdiions  evenm  ASTM  E17]  Standard  Atmospheres  for  Conditiowme  Flesble  Barrier  Matenals  [4],  [23  °C 
22°C  (79.4  °F  23.6  °F)  and  50  %  4  2%  RA].  Unless  resealed,  the  package  should  always  remainin  a  cortrolled  temperature 

and  humidity  room.  Aifer  opemme  the  sealed  package,  remove  at  least  five  Inerboard  sheets.  Handle  the  sheets  by  the  edges  only. 
Allow  onbythe  unprted  side  to  touch  the  tabletop  or  other  foreign  surface.  Use  onkrthe  printed  side  of  the  Imetboard  sheet  for  the 
test.  Condition  all  sheets  at  least  24  h  puorto  testing  (see  ASTM  D  2860). 

Instructions  for  Use:  Each  lrerboarl  sheet  provides  safficiat  matenalfor  14  measmemerts.  Cut  2.54  em  (1m)  wile  stups  parallel 

to  the  29  om  (11.5)  dimension  of  the  Inerboard  sheet  This wil  ewe  astup  2.54  emx  29.2  en {1  mx  11%  m)  withthe  machre 
direction  pmumg  across  the  2.54  em(]  mj)  dimension.  Cut  each  stip  mhalfto  qve  mdivial  test  stups  2.54  em  (1m)x  29em  (11.5

ni. 

To  conduct  a  complete  determmaton  on  one  rel  of  tape,  take  five  tape  specimens  from  the  same  roll  and  five  Imerboard  strips,  one 
from  each  of  five  envebpes.  Do  not  remove  almerboard  stup  ftom  an  envelope  before  preparme the  test.  Remove  at  least  thee  laps 

oftape  fiom  the  roll  before  taking  tape  specumens.  Lightly  sand  the  backing  of  the  tape  on  the  rolwith  a  300-ert  adrasive  paper  to 
remove  the  easy-uraind  treatrert  from  the  tape  backing.  This  willmuprove  the  adhesionof'the  test  tape  to  the  double-coated  tape 
used  to  mut  the  test  tape  to  the  ngid  panel  (see  D  2860  procedure  A) 

If  for  ay  reasona  specimenis  considered  void  (we  D  2860),  select  at  random  another  lmerboard  strip  from  ary  envelope.  If  more 

than  one  specimen  is  voided,  select  at  random  replacemert  inerboarl  strips  fom  a  corresponding  muamber  of  different  envelopes.
