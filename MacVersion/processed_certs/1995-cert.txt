Standard Sapphire Single Crystal Wafer for Crystalline Orientation 

 
This  Standard  Reference  Material  (SRM)  is  intended  for  use  in  the  calibration  of  instruments  (X-ray 
diffractometers)  used  to  measure  the  crystal  orientation  of  wafers  relative  to  the  crystal  surface.    The  SRM  unit 
consists of a 50 mm diameter sapphire wafer.   
 
Certified Values and Uncertainites:  NIST certified values are values for which NIST has the highest confidence 
in its accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or accounted for by NIST [1].  
The crystal orientation of the sapphire crystal C-axis (001) relative to the surface normal has been measured both 
parallel  and  perpendicular  to  an  edge  flat  (A-axis  (11-20))  that  is  manufactured  into  the  wafer.    The  statistical 
uncertainty (type A) has been combined with the maximum systematic error (type B) in quadrature to determine an 
overall error for all wafers of 8.4 arc seconds.  The certified crystal orientation is found in Table 1.  The calibration 
uncertainty components are listed in Table 2. 
 
Expiration  of  Certification:    The  certification  of  this  SRM  is  deemed  to  be  indefinite  within  the  stated 
uncertainties,  provided  the  SRM  is  stored  and  handled  in  accordance  with  the  “Storage  and  Handling”  and 
“Instructions  for  Use”  sections  of  this  certificate.    However,  certification  will  be  nullified  if  the  SRM  is 
contaminated or otherwise altered. 
 
Maintenance  of  SRM  Certification:    NIST  will  monitor  this  SRM  over  the  period  of  its  certification.    If 
substantive technical changes occur that affect the certification before the expiration of this certificate, NIST will 
notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
Coordination for this SRM was provided by E.C. Benck and R.J. Matyi of the NIST Atomic Physics Division. 
 
The  crystal  orientation  measurement  technique,  development,  and  certification  of  this  SRM  were  performed  by 
E.C. Benck of the NIST Atomic Physics Division. 
 
Statistical analysis was performed by B. Toman of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division. 
 

Support aspects involved in the issuance of this SRM were coordinated through the NIST Measurement Services 
Division.

Storage and Handling:  Sapphire is typically inert under ambient and testing conditions.  The sapphire wafer may 
be  returned  to  the  wafer  storage  box  and  reused.    The  wafer  should  not  be  dropped  or  similarly  mechanically 
stressed.  
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 
 
Dust  should  be  removed  from  the  SRM  wafer  surface  and  the  wafer  mount  prior  to  installation  in  the  X-ray 
diffractometer.  The flat manufactured into the wafer should be mounted either parallel or perpendicular to the X-
ray  plane  of  dispersion  with  the  polished  surface  facing  towards  the  X-ray  source.    Consult  the  equipment 
manufacturer’s operating instructions for performing the actual measurements with the SRM.  Measurements should 
be made near the center of the wafer. 
 
Summary  of  Analytical  Method:    The  angular  measurements  were  made  using  a  high  resolution  double  crystal 
X-ray diffractometer.  The diffractometer utilizes a dispersive geometry with a fixed first crystal; for this work, a 
(004)  reflection  from  a  highly  perfect  silicon  reference  crystal  is  used.    The  sample  crystal  is  mounted  on  an 
Ultradex1  precision  indexing  table  that  is in turn mounted on a high precision rotation spindle that is driven by a 
stepper motor and non-rotating micrometer via a sine arm.  The inclusion of the Ultradex table allows the sample to 
be  indexed  in  1°  increments  for  large  excursions  while  leaving  the  sine  arm  drive  (total  angular  range  of 
approximately ± 3°) for precision movements. 
 
Attached  to  the  sample  rotation  spindle  is  a  polarization-encoded  optical  angle  interferometer  that  employs  a 
calibrated  (NIST-traceable)  He-Ne  laser  source.    Angle  measurements  were  performed  by  counting  interference 
fringes with a calibration technique relating fringes to angle increment that was established by conventional angle 
metrology methods.  Since the wavelength of the interferometer is traceable to the SI, the measurements of angular 
misorientation are as well.  

The following measurement procedure was used for each of the sapphire wafers in the production run: 

1.  The wafers were used as supplied by the vendor with no additional preparation. 
2.  The sample was mounted on a precision rotation axis (φ-axis) with the wafer flat parallel to the plane of 
dispersion.  The sample and φ-axis are mounted on the sample rotation or ω-axis of a double crystal X-ray 
diffractometer.  The X-ray beam nominally samples a 1 cm wide area at the center of the wafer.  The ω-
axis is perpendicular to the X-ray plane of dispersion; the rotation of this axis will be calibrated using circle 
closure  with  an  optical  polygon  and  a  precision  nulling  autocollimator.    Angles  were  measured  using  a 
polarization-encoded  angle  interferometer.    These  attributes  (closure  calibration  and  angle  measurement 
with an angle interferometer with calibrated laser) ensure traceability to the SI. 

3.  The sample surface was aligned with respect to a two-axis electronic autocollimator.  The sample surface 
was made perpendicular to the autocollimator to a precision of better than 2 x 10-4 radians (i.e., better than 
4 angular seconds).  The angle in the plane of dispersion corresponding to the crystal being aligned with 
the  autocollimator  is  determined  from  a  linear  least  squares  fit  to  a  series  of  autocollimator  signal 
measurements versus angle measurements. 

4.  The  reflection  from  the  wafer  was  recorded  with  CuKα1  radiation  monochromated  by  a  highly  perfect 
silicon reference crystal.  The angle was determined using a curve fitting routine with the X-ray detector 
signal  and  angle  measurements.    The  angle  difference  between  the  autocollimator  signal  and  the  X-ray 
reflection was calculated. 

5.  The sample was rotated 180° about the φ-axis.  Steps (3) and (4) were repeated in order to determine the 

surface normal and reflection angles from which the difference angle was calculated. 

6.  The  angle  difference  between  the  autocollimator  and  the  X-ray  reflection  determined  in  (4)  and  (5)  was 
summed,  and  one  half  of  this  value  is  the  wafer  misorientation  with  respect  to the  surface  about  an  axis 
perpendicular to the wafer flat. 

7.  The sample was rotated 90° to orient the wafer flat perpendicular to the plane of dispersion. 
8.  Steps 3, 4, and 5 were repeated. 
9.  The  angle  differences  between  the  autocollimator  and  the  X-ray  reflection  determined  in  step  8  were 
summed,  and  one  half  of  this  value  is  the  wafer  misorientation  with  respect  to  the  surface  about  an  axis 
parallel to the wafer flat.

Misalignment of the Sample Normal:  Misalignment of the sample normal out of the plane of the diffractometer 
by  an  amount  φ  leads  to  a  tilt  error  Δθ    =    (φ2/2)  tan  θ.    The  fact  that  the  error  depends  on  the  square  of  the 
misorientation  means  that  as  the  sample  is rotated 180° about the φ-axis, the apparent shift in the diffracted peak 
position will be the same (θ  +  Δθ), so by taking the difference, the tilt error cancels out. 
 
Misalignment of the φ-Axis:  Realignment of the wafer with respect to the autocollimator after each rotation about 
the φ-axis results in errors due to misalignment of the φ-axis from the plane of the diffractometer negligible.

Mounting Misalignment:  An error in aligning the major flat to the diffractometer plane results in an error in the 
direction of the crystal misorientation, but not the overall magnitude.  Although care was taken to remove any dust 
or debris from the wafer and the mounting bar, there always is the possibility of dust causing the wafer flat to be 
misaligned.  In  addition,  there  is  the  possibility  of  the  wafer  support  itself  being  misaligned  relative  to  the 
diffractometer  plane  resulting  in  a  systematic  error.    Consequently,  we  estimate  that  the  absolute  accuracy  of  the 
wafer  alignment  to  be  better  than  20  angular  seconds.    For  the  magnitude  of  angles  being  measured,  this 
corresponds to an uncertainty of 0.15 angular seconds. 
 
Angular Rotation about φ-Axis:  Errors in the angular positioning about the φ-axis result in the most significant 
uncertainty in the crystal orientation measurements.  The angular positioning of the φ-axis bearing is determined by 
a set of interlocking gear teeth.  Based on the manufacturer’s specifications, the angular accuracy should be better 
than  4 angular  minutes.    Consequently,  for  the  magnitude  of  angles  being  measured,  the  maximum  systematic 
uncertainty due to any measured angle is 0.9 angular seconds.  
 
Peak Assignment:  Error in the peak assignment, due to statistical noise, is not a significant source of error.  The 
intensity of the X-ray beam was maintained to produce reasonable signal-to-noise ratios.  Repeat measurements of 
the  same  rocking  curve  without  moving  the  φ-axis  maintain  results  in  the  same  angle  measurement  to  within 
0.1 arc second. 
 
Crystal  Inhomogeneity:    Although  the  sapphire  wafers  are  of  good  quality,  the  wafers  still  exhibited  some 
variation in the crystal orientation across the surface of the wafer.  This is probably due to internal strains within the 
crystal.  A broad X-ray beam was used to average any localized variations in the crystal orientation.  These internal 
strains are probably responsible for the observed line widths of the rocking curves.  Crystals, in which the rocking 
curves were so broad as to blend the two X-ray peaks, were rejected.  A few of the crystals produced rocking curves 
where the X-ray peaks exhibited sub-peaks; this was  probably due to localized regions of strain sampled by the X-
ray.  The curve fitting program could be forced to converge on an individual sub-peak instead of the envelope of the 
entire  peak.    In  the  worst  case,  the  resulting  measurements  using  a  sub-peak  differed  from  the  normal  peak 
assignment method by 5 arc seconds. 
 
Measurement  Repeatability:    The  statistical  measurement  uncertainties  of  SRM  1995  were  determined  from 
repeated measurements of three wafers selected from the production run.  Based on the statistical measurements, an 
expanded uncertainty at the 95 % level of confidence was determined to be below 7 arc seconds.
