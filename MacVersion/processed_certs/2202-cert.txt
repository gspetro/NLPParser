Standard  Reference  Material  2202 

Potassium  Chloride 

(Standard  for  lon-Selective  Electrodes) 

B.  R.  Staples 

This  Standard  Reference  Material  (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  use  in  the  calibration  of  ion-selective  electrodes  for 
potassium  and  chloride  ions.  SRM  2202  consists  of  approximately  160go0f ACS  Potassium  Chloride.  It  conforms  to  the 
American  Chemical  Society  specifications  for  analytical  reagent-grade  material,  but  should  not  be  considered  entirely 
free  from  impurities  such  as  occluded  water  and  traces  of  bromide  and  heavy  metals.  Coulometric  analysis  of  this 
material  indicates  99.9  percent  purity,  and  upon  drying  at  500  °C  for  24  hours,  99.99  percent  of  the  calculated  chloride 
was  found. 

This  material  is  certified  for  the  activity  coefficients  at  25  °C  of the  potassium  and  chloride  ions  at  various  concentrations 
and  the  related  values,  pK  and  pCl.  These  values  are  given  in  the  table  on  the  reverse  page.  The  accuracies  of the  pK  and 
pC!  values  are  estimated  to  be  +  0.01.  The  mean  activity  coefficient  may  be  represented  by  the  equation:

*To  convert  to  parts  per  million  (mg/l)  multiply  by  10? 

The  mean  activity  coefficient  at  temperatures  from  15  to  45  °C  and  for  any  concentration  up  to  0.1  molal  may  be 
obtained  by  using  the  equation  on  the  face  of  the  certificate  and  these  temperature-dependence  expressions  for  its 
constants  A,  and  B  (Constants  6,  C  and  D  are  unimportant  at  0.1  molal  and  below.) 

A  =  0.5108  +  8.4705  x  10“  (-25)  +  3.5498  x  107°  (t-25)" 
B  =  1.295  (1.6  +  4.7218  x  10“  (t-25)). 

The  values  for  pK  and  pC!  may  be  calculated  from  log  y+  using  the  procedure  described  by  Bates,  Staples,  and 
Robinson  [Anal.  Chem.  42,  867  (1976)  ]. 

Preparation  of  Standard  Solutions 

To  prepare  a  1.0  molal  solution,  transfer  72.234  g  of  potassium  chloride  (weight  in  air)  to  a  1-liter  volumetric  flask. 
Dissolve  and  fill  to  the  mark  with  distilled  water  at  25°C.  The  distilled  water  should  have  a  conductivity  no  greater  than 
2x10°O"'.  The  potassium  chloride  should  be  dried  for  2  hours  at 
110°  C  before  use.  Similarly,  a  0.1  molal  solution  may 
be  prepared  by  the  transfer  of  7.410  g  of  potassium  chloride  (weight in  air)  to  a  1-liter  volumetric  flask,  dissolving,  and 
diluting  to  mark  with  distilled  water  at  25°  C.  Appropriate  dilution  of  either  standard  solution  should  be  used  to  obtain 
standards  in  the  concentration  range  of  interest  to  the  user. 

Blectrode  Calibration 

It  is  recommended  that  reference  standards  be  used  at  a  concentration  similar  to  that  of  the  sample  to  minimize  liquid 
junction  potential  errors. 
Use  of  a  bracketing  technique  will  minimize  errors  due  to  non-Nernstian  response  of  the 
electrodes. 
The  use  of  two  standard  solutions  that  bracket  the  concentration  of  the  sample  solution  increases  the 
reliability  of  the  measurement.  Thus,  if  standard  solutions  of  concentrations  slightly  higher  and  lower  than  the  sample 
solution  are  used  to  calibrate  the  pH/millivolt  meter,  the  error  due  to  liquid  junction  potential  will  be  small.
