Certificate of Analysis 
 
Standard Reference Material 2384 
 
Baking Chocolate 

 
This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  use  in  validating  methods  for  determining 
proximates, fatty acids, calories, and elements in baking chocolate and similar matrices.  This SRM can also be used 
for quality assurance when assigning values to in-house reference materials.  The SRM is baking chocolate prepared 
from 100 % cocoa beans by a manufacturer of baking chocolate and consists of a single production lot.  A unit of 
SRM 2384 consists of five 91 g (3.2 oz) individually wrapped bars of baking chocolate. 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values:  Certified mass fraction values for elements and fat in SRM 2384 are provided in 
Tables 1 and 2.  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that all 
known or suspected sources of bias have been taken into account [1].  Analyses for value assignment were performed 
by NIST and collaborating laboratories.  Certified mass fraction values were calculated as the mean of the mean values 
from NIST methods and the median or the mean of the mean measurements made by collaborating laboratories, where 
appropriate.  The associated uncertainties are expressed at an approximately 95 % level of confidence [2,3].  Values 
are reported on an as-received (not dry-mass) basis in mass fraction units [4]. 
 
Reference Mass Fraction Values:  Reference mass fraction values for sodium, fatty acids, proximates, calories, and 
total dietary fiber are provided in Tables 3 through 5.  A NIST reference value is a noncertified value that is the best 
estimate  of  the  true  value  based  on  available  data;  however,  the  value  does  not  meet  the  NIST  criteria  for 
certification [1] and is provided with an associated uncertainty that may reflect only measurement reproducibility, may 
not include all sources of uncertainty, or may reflect a lack of sufficient statistical agreement among multiple analytical 
methods.  Reference mass fraction values were derived from results reported by NIST and collaborating laboratories.  
Values are reported on an as-received (not dry-mass) basis in mass fraction units [4]. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 2384 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until  31 December 2029,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  instructions  given  in  this 
the  SRM  is  damaged, 
certificate  (see  “Instructions  for  Storage  and  Use”).    This  certification  is  nullified  if  the  SRM  is  damaged, 
contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate this notification. 
 
Coordination of the technical measurements leading to the certification of this SRM was performed by M.M. Phillips, 
K.E. Sharpless, and L.J. Wood of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division and H.B. Chin, I-P. Ho, and D.W. Howell of 
the Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA, Washington, DC). 
 
Analytical  measurements  at  NIST  were  performed  by  K.D. Chieh,  K.E. Murphy,  B.C. Nelson,  C.S. Phinney, 
B.J. Porter, K.E. Sharpless, J.R. Sieber, and L.J. Wood of the Chemical Sciences Division. 
 
Statistical analysis was provided by J.H. Yen of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division.

NOTICE TO USERS 
 
SRM 2384 IS INTENDED FOR LABORATORY USE ONLY, NOT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE AND USE 
 
Storage:  Until required for use, the baking chocolate should be stored under refrigeration at approximately 4 °C. 
 
Use:  Test portions for analysis  may be  melted or  grated as described in AOAC Official Method 970.20 [5].  The 
following masses used for NIST analyses should be used as the minimum sample size to ensure valid results: 1 g for 
fat and fatty acids and 0.5 g for elements. 
 
SOURCE, PREPARATION, AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Source and Preparation:  SRM 2384 is baking chocolate prepared from 100 % cocoa beans and taken from a single 
production lot. 
 
NIST Analyses for Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, P, and Zn:  Mass fractions of calcium, copper, iron, potassium, 
magnesium,  manganese,  sodium,  phosphorus,  and  zinc  were  measured  by  inductively-coupled  plasma  optical 
emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) in six bars of chocolate on two or more days.  A quarter of each bar was melted in 
individual beakers and single or duplicate 0.5 g portions were taken from each bar and digested in a microwave sample 
preparation  system  using  nitric  acid.    Digests  were  transferred  to  plastic  bottles  and  diluted  with  the  appropriate 
volume of 1.5 % (volume fraction) nitric acid.  Quantitation was based on the method of standard additions  using 
SRM 3100  series  single  element  standard  solutions.    The  ICP-OES  result  for  sodium  was  confirmed  using  X-ray 
fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy. 
 
dy  isotope  dilution 
NIST  Analyses  for  Cd  and  Pb:    Mass  fractions  of  cadmium  and  lead  were  measured  by  isotope  dilution 
inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ID ICP-MS) in six bars of chocolate.  Two 5 g squares of each bar 
were melted in individual beakers and duplicate 1.0 g portions were spiked with isotopically enriched 206Pb and 111Cd 
and digested in a microwave sample preparation system using nitric acid.  Digests were transferred to plastic bottles 
and diluted  with the appropriate volume of 2 % (volume  fraction) nitric acid.   Lead  was  measured by ICP-MS in 
standard mode, whereas cadmium was measured in collision cell/kinetic energy discrimination mode.  Quantification 
was based on calibration by reverse isotope dilution ICP-MS using primary standard solutions prepared from SRM 746 
Cadmium-Vapor Pressure, SRM 3108 Cadmium (Cd) Standard Solution, SRM 3128 Lead (Pb) Standard Solution, 
and from Pb metal (Johnson Matthey, 99.999+ % pure). 
 
NIST Analyses for Fat:  The mass fraction of fat was measured by pressurized-fluid extraction in two sets of seven 
samples of chocolate.  One-gram portions of grated chocolate  were extracted into petroleum ether.  Extracts  were 
evaporated under nitrogen and then dried at 100 °C to constant mass, per AOAC Official Method 963.15, Fat in Cacao 
Products [5]. 
 
NIST Analyses for Fatty Acids:  Mass fractions of fatty acids were measured by gas chromatography with flame 
ionization  detection  (GC-FID)  in  three  sets  of  five  samples  of  chocolate  over  a  three-day  period.    Using 
pressurized-fluid  extraction,  fat  was  extracted  into  petroleum  ether  from  approximately  1 g  samples  of  grated 
chocolate.    Methyl  nonadecanoate  (C19:0  fatty  acid  methyl  ester [FAME])  was  used  as  an  internal  standard.   A 
two-step process employing methanolic sodium hydroxide and boron trifluoride was used to convert the fatty acids to 
their methyl esters.  FAMEs were extracted into hexane and samples  were analyzed by GC-FID.  Calibrants  were 

                                                           

(1) Certain  commercial  equipment,  instruments  or  materials  are  identified  in  this  certificate  to  adequately  specify  the 
experimental procedure.  Such identification does not imply recommendation or endorsement by the National Institute of Standards 
ndards 
se.
and Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the purpose.

prepared gravimetrically from SRM 2377 Fatty Acid Methyl Esters in 2,2,4 Trimethylpentane at levels intended to 
approximate the levels of the fatty acids in the SRM following extraction.  A single internal standard solution was 
used for the calibrants and samples.  Calculations were based on average response factors for the calibrants. 
 
Analyses by Collaborating Laboratories:  Data from additional sources were used for value assignment, including 
an interlaboratory comparison exercise organized by the GMA FIACC.  Not every laboratory measured every analyte, 
and some data were excluded as outliers.  The GMA FIACC laboratories were asked to use AOAC methods or their 
equivalent, to make single measurements from each of two bars, and to report the analytical method that was used. 
 
Homogeneity Assessment:  The homogeneity of elements and fatty acids was assessed at NIST using the methods 
described  above.   A  small  but  statistically  significant  heterogeneity  was  found  for  cadmium,  calcium,  lead,  and 
manganese, and an inhomogeneity component has been included in the expanded uncertainties for these analytes.  All 
other analytes, including those for which homogeneity was not assessed, have been treated as homogeneous. 
 
Value Assignment:  The collaborating laboratories reported individual results for two to eight analyses for a given 
analyte.  The mean of each laboratory’s results was then determined.  For calculation of assigned values for analytes 
that  were  measured  only  by  the  collaborating  laboratories,  the  mean  of  the  collaborating  laboratory  means  was 
determined.    For  analytes  that  were  also  measured  by  NIST,  the  median  or  mean  of  the  individual  collaborating 
laboratory means and the mean of the individual sets of NIST data were averaged, as appropriate.  For analytes that 
were only measured by NIST, the mean of the individual sets of NIST data were averaged, as appropriate. 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values for Elements:  Each certified mass fraction value is the combined mean from the 
mean  of  results  from  analyses  by  NIST  and  the  median  or  mean  of  the  mean  results  provided  by  collaborating 
laboratories, where appropriate.  Values are expressed as x ± U95%(x), where x is the certified value and U95%(x) is the 
expanded uncertainty of the certified value.  The true value of the analyte lies within the interval x ± U95%(x) with 
95 % confidence.  To propagate this uncertainty, the certified value should be treated as a normally distributed random 
variable with mean x and standard deviation U95%(x)/2 [2-4,6,7].  The uncertainties for cadmium, calcium, lead, and 
manganese also incorporate an additional uncertainty component for possible inhomogeneity.  The measurands are 
the total mass fractions of elements in baking chocolate as listed in Table 1 on an as-received basis.  Metrological 
traceability is to the SI measurement unit for chemical mass fraction, expressed as milligrams per kilogram.

Certified Mass Fraction Value for Fat:  The certified mass fraction value is the combined mean from the mean of 
results from analyses by NIST and the mean of results provided by collaborating laboratories.  The value is expressed 
as x ± U95%(x), where x is the certified value and U95%(x) is the expanded uncertainty of the certified value.  The true 
value  of  the  analyte  lies  within  the  interval  x ± U95%(x)  with  95 %  confidence.   To  propagate  this  uncertainty,  the 
certified  value  should  be  treated  as  a  normally  distributed  random  variable  with  mean  x  and  standard  deviation 
U95%(x)/2 [2-4].  The measurand is the total mass fraction of extractable fat in baking chocolate as listed in Table 2 on 
an  as-received  basis.    Metrological  traceability  is  to  the  measurement  processes  and  standards  used  by  NIST  and
