Technology 

 
This  Standard  Reference  Material  (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  use  in  validating  analytical  methods  for  the 
determination of catechins, xanthines, and toxic elements in solid oral dosage forms containing green tea and in similar 
matrices.  SRM 3256 can also be used for quality assurance when assigning values to in-house control materials.  A 
unit of SRM 3256 consists of five packets, each containing approximately 2.5 g of powdered material.   
 
; 
The development of SRM 3256 was a collaboration among the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), 
linistration 
the National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements (NIH-ODS), and the Food and Drug Administration 
Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (FDA CDER). 
 
nes  and  toxic 
Certified Mass Fraction Values:  The certified mass fraction values of selected catechins and xanthines and toxic 
elements are provided in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest 
confidence  in  its  accuracy  in  that  all  known  or  suspected  sources  of  bias  have  been  investigated  or  taken  into 
account [1].  Values for catechins and xanthines were derived from the combination of results provided by NIST using 
two independent methods and by two collaborating laboratories.  The certified values for catechins and xanthines in 
this material are the equally weighted means of the individual sets of results; the associated uncertainties are expanded 
uncertainties at the 95 % level of confidence [2–4].  Values for toxic elements were provided by NIST and participants 
in an interlaboratory comparison exercise.  The certified values  for toxic elements  in this  material are the equally 
weighted  mean  of  the  mean  of  NIST  results  and  the  median  of  collaborating  laboratories’  results;  the  associated 
uncertainties are expanded uncertainties at the 95 % level of confidence [2–4].  Values are reported on a dry-mass basis 
in mass fraction units [5]. 
 
Reference  Mass  Fraction  Values:    Reference  mass  fraction  values  for  gallocatechin  gallate,  theanine,  and 
theophylline are provided in Table 3.  Reference values are noncertified values that are the best estimate of the true 
values based on available data; however, the values do not meet the NIST criteria for certification [1] and are provided 
with  associated  uncertainties  that  may  reflect  only  measurement  reproducibility,  may  not  include  all  sources  of 
uncertainty, or may reflect a lack of sufficient statistical agreement among multiple analytical methods.   
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 3256 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until 30 November 2021, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given in this 
lis  damaged, 
certificate (see “Warning and Instructions for Storage and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, 
contaminated, or otherwise modified.

Maintenance  of  SRM  Certification:    NIST  will  monitor  this  material  over  the  period  of  its  certification.    If 
substantive  technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will 
notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification.

RUCTIONS  FOR  STORAGE  AND  USE 
WARNING AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE AND USE 
 
Warning:  For laboratory use only.  Not for human consumption.   
 
Storage:  The material should be stored at controlled room temperature (20 °C to 25 °C), in an unopened packet, until 
needed.   
 
ghly. 
Use:  Prior to removal of a test portion for analysis, the contents of a packet of material should be mixed thoroughly.  
For certified values to be valid, test portions of 60 mg to 100 mg  for catechin analyses  and 50 mg to 100 mg  for 
xanthine analyses should be used.  The stability of catechins, xanthines, and theanine in opened packets has not been 
investigated.  Test portions should be analyzed as received and results converted to a dry-mass basis by determining 
moisture content (described below) on a separate test portion. 
 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS 1 
 
Material  Acquisition  and  Preparation:   SRM  3256  was  prepared  from  several  different  commercially  available 
products (both tablets and capsules) that were purchased in the marketplace.  The tablets and the contents of capsules 
were ground using a Teflon disc mill at room temperature.  The powdered materials were transferred to High-Purity 
Standards  (Charleston,  SC)  where  they  were  blended,  aliquotted,  and  heat-sealed  inside  nitrogen-flushed  4  mil 
polyethylene bags, which were then sealed inside nitrogen-flushed aluminized plastic bags along with two packets of 
silica  gel  each.    Following  packaging,  SRM  3256  was  irradiated  (Neutron  Products,  Inc.,  Dickerson,  MD)  to  an 
absorbed dose of 7.9 kGy to 9.5 kGy.   
 
Analytical  Approach  for  Determination  of  Catechins,  Xanthines,  and  Theanine:    Value  assignment  of  the 
concentrations of the catechins and xanthines in SRM 3256 was based on the combination of measurements from two 
different liquid chromatography (LC) methods with different detection, i.e., ultraviolet absorbance detection (UV) and 
mass  spectrometry  (MS)  and  by  data  provided  by  collaborating  laboratories  using  LC  with  fluorescence 
detection (LC/FL) and LC/UV.  NIST provided theanine measurements by using LC/MS. 
 
NIST Analyses  for  Catechins:    Catechins  were  measured  by  using  two  LC  methods  with  UV  or  MS  detection.  
Calibrants  were  prepared  gravimetrically,  and  a  single  internal  standard  solution  was  used  for  the  calibrants  and 
samples.  For Catechin Method 1, below, a series of three calibrants containing varying analyte levels was used.  For 
Catechin Method 2, below, four calibrants were prepared at levels approximating the values expected in the SRMs.   
 
Catechin Method 1.  To establish the optimum test portion size for catechin analysis, test portions of varying masses 
(50 mg to 200 mg) from each of six packets were analyzed.  Materials were individually combined with Ottawa sand 
internal  standard), 
(Sigma-Aldrich,  Milwaukee,  WI),  7-(β-hydroxypropyl)theophylline  (proxyphylline; 
ethylenediaminetetracetic  acid  (EDTA),  methanol,  and  water,  and  were  extracted  by  inversion  (rotation)  for  2  h.  
Samples were centrifuged, the supernatant decanted, and re-extracted.  Supernatants were combined and filtered prior 
to analysis by using LC/UV with a C18 column and absorbance detection at 210 nm.  A typical separation is provided 
in Figure 1.

Method 

Catechin Method 2.  Two 60 mg test portions from each of six packets were combined with proxyphylline (internal 
standard) and extracted by ultrasonic agitation for 90 min.  The extraction process was repeated using fresh solvent, 
and supernatants were combined.  Supernatants were syringe-filtered prior to analysis by using LC/UV and LC/MS.  
>tor  (detection 
A C18 column (different brand than that used for Catechin Method 1) was used with an absorbance detector (detection 
at 280 nm) and a mass spectrometer (electrospray ionization source; ESI) connected in series.  Selected ion monitoring 
was used for quantitation at m/z 171 for gallic acid (GA), m/z 239 for proxyphylline (internal standard; IS), m/z 291 
for  catechin  (C)  and  epicatechin  (EC),  m/z  307  for  gallocatechin  (GC)  and  epigallocatechin  (EGC),  m/z  443  for 
\ 
epicatechin  gallate  (ECG),  and  m/z  459  for  gallocatechin  gallate  (GCG)  and  epigallocatechin  gallate  (EGCG).    A 
typical separation is provided in Figure 1.   
 
NIST Analyses for Xanthines:  Xanthines were measured by using LC/UV and LC/MS.  Calibrants were prepared 
yared 
the  levels  of  the 
gravimetrically, at levels intended to approximate the levels of the xanthines in the SRM.  A single internal standard 
solution was used for the calibrants and samples.   
 
Xanthine Method 1.  Caffeine (Caf) and theobromine (TB) were measured simultaneously with the catechins measured 
using Catechin Method 1, above. 
 
Xanthine Method 2.  Caffeine and theophylline were measured in two 50 mg test portions from each of six packets. 
Test portions were individually combined with an internal standard solution containing trimethyl-13C3-caffeine and 
13C15N2-theophylline, methanol, and water.  Materials were extracted using ultrasonic agitation for 2 h.  Samples were 
syringe-filtered prior to LC/MS analysis.  A C18 column and ESI in positive polarity were used, and ions at m/z 198 
for  labeled  caffeine,  m/z  195  for  caffeine,  m/z  184  for  labeled  theophylline,  and  m/z  181  for  theophylline  were 
monitored.   
 
Xanthine Method 3.  Theobromine (and theanine) were measured in two 50 mg test portions from each of six packets. 
Test  portions  were  individually  combined  with  an  internal  standard  solution  containing  2H6-theobromine  and 
2H5-L-theanine, methanol, and phosphate buffer in water.  Materials were extracted using ultrasonic agitation for 2 h. 
Samples were syringe-filtered prior to LC/MS analysis.  A C18 column and ESI in positive polarity were used, and 
ions  at  m/z  187  for  labeled  theobromine,  m/z  181  for  theobromine,  m/z  180  for  labeled  theanine,  and  m/z  175  for 
theanine were monitored.   
 
NIST Analyses for Theanine:  Theanine was measured simultaneously with theobromine (Xanthine Method 3) using 
LC/MS [6].  Calibrants were prepared gravimetrically, at levels intended to approximate the levels of the theanine in 
the SRM.  A single internal standard solution was used for the calibrants and samples.   
 
Collaborating Laboratories’ Analyses:  Hershey Foods analyzed 250 mg test portions from each of six packets for 
catechin, epicatechin, caffeine, and theobromine using sonication, and analyzed extracts by using LC/FL (catechins) 
or LC/UV at 280 nm (xanthines).  Tampa Bay Analytical Research analyzed 150 mg test portions in triplicate from 
each of five packets for catechins and caffeine using sonication.  Extracts were analyzed by using LC/UV. 
 
ations  of  arsenic, 
Analytical Approach for Determination of Toxic Elements:  Value assignment of the concentrations of arsenic, 
NIST  using 
cadmium,  lead,  and  mercury  in  SRM  3256  was  based  on  the  combination  of  measurements  from  NIST  using 
inductively  coupled  plasma-mass  spectrometry  (ICPMS)  methods  and  data  provided  through  an  International 
Measurement Evaluation Programme (IMEP) interlaboratory comparison exercise organized by IRMM [7]. 
 
NIST Analyses for Toxic Elements:  Two 0.5 g test portions from six packets of SRM 3256 were digested in nitric 
acid in a microwave and analyzed by ICPMS.  Arsenic, cadmium, and lead were measured using the collision cell 
mode  (CCT-ICPMS)  and  the  method  of  standard  additions.    Mercury  was  measured  using  isotope  dilution  and  a 
cold-vapor introduction system (ID-CV-ICPMS) [8].   
 
Collaborating  Laboratories’  Analyses:    Results  were  reported  by  54  laboratories  representing  20  countries  [7].  
Laboratories used their usual methods of analysis.   
 
Determination of Moisture:  Moisture content of SRM 3256 was determined at NIST (see “Warning and Instructions 
for Storage and Use”) by (1) freeze-drying to constant mass over 7 days and (2) drying over magnesium perchlorate 
in a desiccator at room temperature for 28 days.  Unweighted results obtained using both techniques were averaged to 
determine a conversion factor of (0.9764 ± 0.0033) gram dry mass per gram as-received mass, which was used to 
convert data from an as-received to a dry-mass basis; the uncertainty shown on this value is an expanded uncertainty.  
An  uncertainty  component  for  the  conversion  factor  (0.15  %)  obtained  from  the  moisture  measurements  is 
incorporated in the uncertainties of the certified and reference values, reported on a dry-mass basis, that are provided 
in this certificate.

Homogeneity Assessment:  The homogeneity of catechins, xanthines, and theanine was assessed at NIST by using 
the LC/UV and LC/MS methods described above.  The homogeneity of arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury was 
assessed at NIST by using ID-CV-ICPMS and CCT-ICPMS.  An analysis of variance did not show inhomogeneity for 
the test portions analyzed; see “Warning and Instructions for Storage and Use.” 
 
Value Assignment:  The equally weighted mean of results provided by LC/UV, LC/MS, and the individual means of 
collaborating laboratories’ data, where available, were used to calculate assigned values for the organic compounds.  
In cases where data were provided using two detectors in series, the average was treated as a single method mean 
when it was combined with other data.  The equally weighted means from the NIST data sets and the median of the 
lab means for the IMEP study were used to calculate assigned values for toxic elements.

(a) Each certified value, expressed as a mass fraction, is an equally weighted mean of results provided by using LC/UV, LC/MS, 
and the individual means of collaborating laboratories’ data where available.  In cases where data were provided by using UV 
and  MS  detectors  in  series,  the  average  was  treated  as  a  single  method  mean  when  it  was  combined  with  other  data.    The 
uncertainty provided with each value is an expanded uncertainty about the mean to cover the measurand with approximately 
95  %  confidence;  it  incorporates  Type  B  uncertainty  components  related  to  the  analyses,  as  well  as  a  component  related  to 
moisture  correction,  and  expresses  both  the  observed  difference  between  the  results  from  the  methods  and  their  respective 
uncertainties, consistent with the ISO Guide and its Supplement 1 [2–4].  The expanded uncertainty is calculated as U = kuc, 
where  uc  is  the  combined uncertainty,  and  k  is  a  coverage  factor  corresponding  to  approximately  95  %  confidence  for  each 
analyte.  The measurands are the mass fractions of (+)-catechin, (–)-epicatechin, (–)-epicatechin gallate, (–)-epigallocatechin, 
(–)-epigallocatechin  gallate,  (–)-gallocatechin,  (–)-gallocatechin  gallate,  gallic  acid,  caffeine,  and  theobromine  in  Green
