Thermal Spray Powder – Particle Size Distribution 
Tungsten Carbide/Cobalt (Acicular) 

 

 
This  Standard  Reference  Material  (SRM)  is  primarily  intended  for  use  in  the  calibration  of  equipment  used  to 
measure particle size distributions (PSD) in the 9 µm to 30 µm range.  A unit of SRM 1984 consists of a single bottle 
containing approximately 14 g of tungsten carbide/cobalt powder.   
 
Certified values:  The PSD values at five mass percentiles were measured by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) 
and laser light scattering (LLS).  The certified PSD values by SEM are listed in Table 1.  These certified values were 
determined by the measurement of over 10 000 individual particles from three bottles.  The reference PSD values by 
LLS are listed in Table 2.  A comparison of the two methods is shown in Figure 1.

(a) The uncertainty at each percentile, computed according to the ISO/JCGM and NIST Guides [1], is an expanded uncertainty at 
the 95 % level of confidence.  The measurands are the certified PSD values listed in Table 1.  Metrological traceability is to 
the SI unit for lenght (expressed as µm).

Expiration  of  Certification:    The  certification  of  SRM 1984  is  valid  indefinitely,  within  the  measurement 
uncertainty  specified,  provided  the  sample  dispersion  procedures are rigorously followed (see “Sample Dispersion 
and Measurement Procedures for Light Scattering Method”).  Periodic recertification of this SRM is not required.  
The powder contains no organic binder and is, therefore, considered chemically stable.  The certification is nullified 
if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance  of  SRM  Certification:    NIST  will  monitor  this  SRM  over  the  period  of  its  certification.    If 
substantive  technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will 
notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
The concept for the development of this SRM was provided by S.J. Dapkunas formerly of NIST. 
 
The SRM measurement technique, development, and certification were performed by J.F. Kelly and P. Pei formerly 
of NIST. 
 
Statistical analyses were performed by H-k. Liu of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division.

Support aspects involved in the issuance of this SRM were coordinated through the NIST Office of Reference Materials. 
 
Measurement  of  SRM:    The  starting  material  was  a  10 kg  batch  from  a  single  lot (W2203A)  of  Type SD 251 
tungsten carbide/cobalt powder obtained from OSRAM Sylvania Products, Inc.(1) (Towanda, PA).  This powder was 
chosen for its size distribution, irregularly shaped particle morphology (Figure 2), resistance to fracture on handling, 
and low level of aggregation. 
 
The powder was split into bottle units containing approximately 14 g each by using spinning rifflers.  A randomized 
set of 100 bottles from 672 bottles was selected for homogeneity testing, round robin study using LLS instruments, 
and certification analyses by SEM.  Homogeneity testing of 14 randomly selected bottles, measured in duplicate, was 
performed with a LLS instrument at NIST.  The data showed no evidence of size heterogeneity.  
 
Scanning  Electron  Microscopy  Analysis:    SEM  based  image  analysis  was  carried  out  on  three  bottles.    Sample 
preparation for microscopy entailed both a reduction in the mass of powder and a separation into size fractions.  The 
size  fractionation  was  accomplished  by  sieving  using  sieves  with  nominal  openings  of  10 µm,  20 µm,  and  30 µm.  
Subsamples from each of the sieve splits were then produced by successive division using a spinning riffler.  
 
SEM  images  were  acquired  for  each  of  the  sieve  fractions.   The backscatter electron images of the particles were 
acquired  as  greyscale  image  files  into  a  computer  via  a  digital  interface.    The  2048 × 2048 pixel  images  were 
analyzed to obtain the projected areas of the tungsten carbide/cobalt particles.  These areas were fitted with ellipses 
and  the  major  and  minor  axes  converted  to  particle  volumes  (prolate  ellipsoids)  and  particle  diameters  using  the 
average  of  the  three  ellipsoid  axes.    The  pixel-to-length  conversion  was  calibrated  using  a  micrometer  slide 
calibrated at NIST using laser interferometry.  Several hundred particles of each sieve fraction were measured for a 
total of approximately 2 400 particles measured from each bottle.  Particle size distributions describing the percent 
of powder mass represented by particles with diameters less than a given length were calculated using the weighting 
factors obtained from the sieving results.  The diameter values corresponding to the specific mass fractions of 10 %, 
25 %, 50 %, 75 %, and 90 % are listed in Table 1.  Current practice in the thermal spray industry is to specify these 
values to define the particle size distribution.  A graphical comparison of the distribution measured by SEM with the 
mean distribution obtained by LLS is shown in Figure 1.  
 
Laser  Light  Scattering  Method  (Round Robin Study):  Ten laboratories participated in this round robin study.  
Each round robin participant received two bottles for analysis using their light scattering instruments.  The reference 
distribution  values  given  in  Table 2  are  based  on  20 measurements  by  the  10 participating  laboratories.    The  LLS 
data  from  all  10 laboratories  were  obtained  using  such  instruments  as  the  Horiba LA910,  Microtrac X100, 
Sympatec HELOS,  and  Beckman  Coulter LS 230  following  the  sample  preparation  procedure  specified  by  NIST.  
Therefore,  in  the  use  of  this  SRM,  the  sample  dispersion  procedure  is  mandatory;  otherwise,  the  data  may  not  be 
comparable.  Although the light scattering instruments produce a continuous plot of weight percent finer than a given 
diameter, five cumulative percentiles were selected as a representative data set for certification since it is consistent 
with the industrial practice.

SAMPLE DISPERSION AND MEASUREMENT PROCEDURES FOR LIGHT SCATTERING METHOD 
 
Sample  Dispersion  Procedure:    Application  of  the  reference  values  produced  by  LLS  requires  following  this 
sample  dispersion  procedure;  otherwise,  results  may  not  be  comparable  to  the  reference  values  listed  in  Table 2.  
NOTE:  Each sample bottle contains approximately 14 g tungsten carbide/cobalt powder that is sufficient for many 
analyses by LLS instruments.   
 
1.  Use  a  microriffler  for  splitting  the  sample  into  subsamples  of  the  appropriate  mass  as  specified  by  the 

manufacturer’s instructions.   

 
2.  Add  4 %  aqueous  sodium  pyrophosphate  solution  to  each  subsample at the ratio of 1.00 mL/g of powder and 
lagnetic  stirrer  since  the  powder  will  attach 
make a paste by mixing gently with a spatula.  DO NOT use a magnetic stirrer since the powder will attach 
to the magnet and may be crushed during stirring.   

 
3.  Transfer the paste quantitatively (totally) into the measuring cell containing distilled water whose pH has been 
pre-adjusted  to  9.5 ± 0.1  with  1 mol/L sodium  hydroxide  solution.    Flush  the  container  with  pH-adjusted 
distilled water to complete the transfer. 

 
4.  Follow the instrument manufacturers’ instructions for instrument calibration and operation.
