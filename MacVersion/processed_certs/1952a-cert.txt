Standard Reference Material® 1952a



Cholesterol in FreezeDried Human Serum



(In Cooperation with the College of American Pathologists)



This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended primarily for use in evaluating the accuracy of procedures for the determination of cholesterol in serum, and in validating working or secondary reference materials.  A unit of SRM 1952a consists of six 10 mL vials containing approximately 0.28 g of freezedried serum, two vials each at three different concentration levels of cholesterol.  Before use, the serum in each vial must be reconstituted with 3.00 mL of distilled water.

		(a)	The measurand is the concentration level of cholesterol; metrological traceability is to the derived SI unit for concentration expressed as millimoles per liter or milligrams per deciliter.

	

Certified Values:  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [1].  The certified concentrations in Table 1 apply only to reconstituted serum at room temperature, 20 °C to 25 °C.  The uncertainty in the certified value is an expanded uncertainty about the mean to cover the measurand with approximately 95 % confidence; it incorporates Type B uncertainty components related to the analyses, consistent with the ISO/JCGM Guide and with its Supplement 1 [2,3].  The expanded uncertainty is calculated as U = kuc, where uc is the combined uncertainty, and the coverage factor, k = 2, corresponds to an approximately 95 % confidence for each analyte.



Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 1952a is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, until 30 September 2018, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with instructions given in this certificate (see “Instructions for Storage and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, or otherwise modified. 



Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive technical changes occur that affect the certification before the expiration of this certificate, NIST will notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate this notification.



Coordination of the technical measurements leading to the certification of this SRM was performed by M.J. Welch of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division and E. White V and K.W. Phinney of the NIST Biomolecular Measurement Division.



Certification measurements were performed by L.T. Sniegoski, S.S.C. Tai, and M.J. Welch of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division and by P.M. Ellerbe, a NIST research associate at NIST through the College of American Pathologists.

NOTICE AND WARNINGS TO USERS



SRM 1952a IS INTENDED FOR RESEARCH USE.  THIS IS A HUMANSOURCE MATERIAL.  HANDLE PRODUCT AS A BIOHAZARDOUS MATERIAL CAPABLE OF TRANSMITTING INFECTIOUS DISEASE.  The supplier of the serum has tested the source materials used to prepare this product and found them nonreactive/negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg) and human immunodeficiency (HIV) 1 and 2 antibodies.  However, no known test method can offer complete assurance that hepatitis B virus, HIV, or other infectious agents are absent from this material.  Accordingly, this human bloodbased product should be handled at the Biosafety Level 2 or higher as recommended for any POTENTIALLY INFECTIOUS HUMAN SERUM OR BLOOD SPECIMEN in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/National Institutes of Health Manual [4].

							

						Instructions for Storage and Use



Storage:  The freezedried serum should be stored at a temperature between 2 °C and 8 °C.  It should not be frozen or exposed to sunlight or ultraviolet radiation.



Use:  Remove the metal closure and lightly tap bottom of vial to dislodge any serum particles from the stopper.  Carefully remove the stopper to avoid possible loss of serum particles.  Use a Type I Class A volumetric transfer pipet or other dispenser of known accuracy to add 3.00 mL  0.01 mL of distilled water.  The distilled water should be between 20 °C and 25 °C and should be added slowly to the sides of the vial while continually turning the vial.  Any additional volume outside these limits will add to the specified uncertainty of the values in Table 1.  Replace the stopper, swirl at intervals for approximately one hour, and finally invert the vial several times.  Do not shake vigorously because this will cause frothing.  Use immediately at temperatures between 20 °C and 25 °C, or store between 2 °C and 8 °C until ready for use, preferably within 8 h.



SOURCE, PREPARATION, AND ANALYSIS()



Source and Preparation:  The human serum used in the preparation of SRM 1952a was provided by the College of American Pathologists (CAP).



Analysis:  The certified values for cholesterol were determined by isotope dilution gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (IDGCMS) [5,6].  This method is recognized as a higherorder reference measurement procedure by the Joint Committee for Traceability in Laboratory Medicine (JCTLM) [7].  Value assignment of the concentration of cholesterol in SRM 1952a was based on the results from the NIST IDGCMS reference measurement procedure for cholesterol in serum [5,6].  This procedure employs hydrolysis of cholesterol esters using potassium hydroxide (KOH) in ethanol, followed by extraction with hexane, and derivatization of cholesterol using bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide.  The freezedried serum was reconstituted with distilled water as described in “Instructions for Storage and Use”.  SRM 911c Cholesterol was used to calibrate the method, and cholesterol25,26,27-13C3 was used as the internal standard.
