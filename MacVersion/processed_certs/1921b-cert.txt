Infrared Transmission Wavelength/Wavenumber Standard 

/Wavenumber 

 
This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  use  in  calibrating  the  wavelength/wavenumber 
scale of spectrophotometers in the infrared (IR) spectral region from 3.2 µm to 18.5 µm (540 cm-1 to 3125 cm-1).  A unit 
of SRM 1921b consists of a matte finish polystyrene film approximately 38 µm thick with a 25 mm diameter exposed 
area, centered 38 mm from the bottom of a cardboard holder, which is 5 cm × 11 cm × 0.2 cm in size. 
 
Certified Wavelength/Wavenumber Values:  The spectral transmittance of a statistically representative group of 
the  polystyrene  film  SRM  specimens  was  measured  under  both  vacuum  and  purge  conditions.    The  positions  of 
absorption  bands  in  the  range  of  3.2 µm  to  18.5 µm  were  obtained  using  both  a  centroid  method  as  well  as  a  band 
minimum determination method.  Thirteen of the band locations were selected for certification based on experimental 
and statistical analysis results.  The certified wavelength values and associated uncertainties of these bands are shown 
in Tables 1 and 3 for the centroid and band minimum methods, respectively.  The corresponding wavenumber values 
and  associated  uncertainties  of  the  bands  are  shown  in  Tables 2  and  4,  respectively.    (See  section  entitled  “Band 
Wavenumber and Wavelength Determination” for details).  To aid the user in distinguishing among the bands during 
measurement, a spectrum is shown in Figure 1, with arrows identifying the certified bands.  For band wavelength and 
wavenumber  values  measured  in  air  or  under  purge  conditions,  see  section  entitled  “Correction  for  Air/Nitrogen 
Purge”. 
 
The expanded uncertainty, U, is provided for each certified band wavelength and wavenumber.  It is the product of 
the coverage factor, k = 4, and the combined standard uncertainty.  The combined standard uncertainty is the root sum 
of squares of all the uncertainty components [1,2]. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 1921b is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until 31 December 2021, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given in this 
certificate (see “Instructions for Storage, Handling, and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, 
contaminated, otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Overall direction and coordination of the technical measurements leading to certification were performed under the 
supervision of R.V. Datla and L.M. Hanssen of the NIST Sensor Science Division. 
 
Technical measurements leading to certification were performed by R. Saunders and L.M. Hanssen of NIST.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE, HANDLING, AND USE 
 
Storage and Handling:  When not in use, SRM 1921b should be kept in its accompanying protective cover.  For 
storage, it is advisable to keep the SRM in a desiccator cabinet.  The SRM should always be handled with care; the 
exposed film surface should never be touched by fingers or any other objects.  Dust may be removed by blowing with 
clean, dry air. 
 
Measurement Conditions: (1)  The calibration measurements were made using a Bomem DA-3.02 Fourier transform 
spectrophotometer.  The instrument room temperature was maintained at 23 °C ± l °C and the humidity ranged from 
30 % to 50 % during the measurements.  Calibration measurements were made under a purge gas of clean air (with 
CO2 and H2O removed) at atmospheric pressure.  Details of the measurement methodology can be found in reference 2. 
 
Source of Material:  The polystyrene film used for SRM 1921b was taken from a single roll.  It was manufactured 
by the Dow Chemical Company and donated by the Coblentz Society. 
 
SRM 
Calibration Measurements:  Prior to calibration with SRM 1921b, the spectrophotometer should be set up under the 
following conditions: 
 

Step 1.  Set the instrumental resolution to any value up to a maximum of 4 cm-1.  For a resolution of 4 cm-1 used 
with a Fourier transform spectrophotometer no (equivalent to Boxcar) apodization should be used in the 
Fourier transform processing [3,4].  For 2 cm-1 or less resolution, other apodizations can be used.  Within 
these constraints, the most appropriate resolution for calibration is the one that is used for typical sample 
measurements.  

Step 2.  Set the source aperture to provide sufficient signal for measurement, yet not greater than that required to 
maintain  measurement  resolution.    The  setting  should  not  be  so  large  that  the  wavenumber  shift  error 
becomes significant [5] or the detector becomes significantly non-linear [6,7]. 

Step 3.  Close and purge or evacuate the sample chamber for a time suitable for the instrument to reach pressure 

and temperature equilibrium. 

Step 4.  Obtain at least six transmittance spectra of SRM 1921b for statistical evaluation. 
Step 5.  Analyze the resulting spectra for band locations as described in the next section. 
Step 6.  When  appropriate,  apply  the  results  to  correct  the  spectrometer’s  wavelength/wavenumber  scale  as 

section.
described in the last section. 

 
The purpose of analysis in step 5 is to obtain band locations as discussed below. 
 
Band  Wavenumber  and  Wavelength  Determination:    Two  methods  have  been  used  to  obtain  calibrated  band 
locations: a centroid method with band fraction of 0.5 and a band minimum determination method.  Both methods 
have  been  applied  to  spectra  in  wavenumbers.    Wavelength  values  can  be  obtained  from  the  wavenumber  values 
through  the  relationship  λν = 1,  where  λ  is  the  wavelength  in  cm  (see  also  the  description  below  on  potential 
atmospheric corrections).  The user can select either Tables 1 and 2 if they apply the centroid (with band fraction of 
0.5) method, or Tables 3 and 4 if they apply any method designed to obtain the band minimum.  Note that calibration 
values  are  now  provided  for  the  1943 cm-1  absorption  band (#9),  but  only  for  use  with  a  band  minimum  location 
method; this is new for SRM 1921b.  (For band #9 use of the centroid method is associated with significantly greater 
uncertainties and is not recommended.) 
 
Centroid Method 
 
The first method used to determine the band wavenumber (υ) and wavelength (λ) values of SRM 1921b is the centroid 
(also known as the center of gravity) method [8,9].  This procedure is performed on the transmittance spectra using 
wavenumber values only.  The wavenumber value is defined as the number of waves per unit length (cm).  Refer to 
Figure 2 for the following band determination procedure description.  The process is applied for each calibration band. 
 
 

 

                                                           

(1) Certain  commercial  equipment,  instruments  or  materials  are  identified  in  this  certificate  to  adequately  specify  the 
experimental procedure.  Such identification does not imply recommendation or endorsement by the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the purpose.

First,  the  bounds  of  an  initial  wavenumber  range (νmin  to  νmax)  enclosing  the  band  are  determined;  they  are  the 
the  differences 
wavenumber values at which transmittance relative maxima occur on either side of the band.  Next, the differences 
between the transmittance values at each bound and the transmittance at the band minimum, 
 
 
 
are determined.  Then half the value of the smaller of ∆T(νmax) and ∆T(νmin), ∆To/2 is determined.  The wavenumber 
range (ν1 to ν2) to be used in the centroid calculation is that between the wavenumber values where the transmittance 
values on either side of the band equal the minimum transmittance value plus ∆To/2, 
 
 

∆T(νmax) = [T(νmax) - T(ν band min)] and ∆T(νmin) = [T(νmin) - T(ν band min)],

Band Minimum Determination Method 
 
accurately
A  NIST-designed  method  is  applied  to  determine  accurately  the  band  minimum  (or  maximum)  value  to  obtain 
calibration values for SRM 1921b.  This  method is called the  extrapolated centroid method [10,11].  It entails the 
calculation of centroid values for a set of fractions (approaching zero fraction) of the band and extrapolating a curve 
fit through the set of values to a value for zero fraction that corresponds to the band minimum (or maximum).  Results 
of any method that is designed to find the band minimum should produce essentially the same result and hence be 
directly comparable [4,12]. 
 
Correction for Air/Nitrogen Purge:  The NIST certification measurements were performed under clean air purge.  
However, it should be noted that the wavelength values reported in Table 1 are vacuum values where the index of 
refraction, n, equals 1.  For instruments that operate under vacuum, calibration measurements of SRM 1921b can be 
directly compared to values in Table l.  Also, for instruments which give vacuum wavenumber and wavelength values 
(such  as  Fourier  transform  infrared (FTIR)  spectrometers  which  use  helium-neon  lasers  for  determination  of  the 
wavenumber scale) even when operated under air or purge gas, as in our case, no corrections are necessary.   
 
In all other cases when measurements of SRM 1921b are made under air, nitrogen, or other purge gas, the wavenumber 
and wavelength values need to be adjusted for the index of refraction of the gas (n = 1.000 26 for dry nitrogen gas at 
atmospheric pressure and T = 298 K) [13,14].  Thus, for nitrogen purge, the user-measured wavenumber values should 
be divided by 1.000 26, and the wavelength values should be multiplied by 1.000 26 to compare to the certified values 
in Table l. 
 
Corrections  due  to  Sample  Temperature:    The  certified  values  in  Tables 1  through  4  are  for  SRM 1921b  at  a 
nominal temperature of 23 °C (296 K).  The expanded uncertainties include accommodation for a temperature range 
of  ± 5 °C.    For  temperatures  outside  this  range  (18 °C  to  28 °C),  the  user  should  correct  the  values  using  the 
temperature  coefficients  given  in  Table 5.    The  table  only  contains  values  for  those  bands  where  the  temperature 
dependence  is  significant  relative  to  the  expanded  uncertainties.    Below  15 °C  and  above  35 °C,  the  appropriate 
corrections have not been determined and the user is advised not to exceed this range.

Corrections to Instrument Wavenumber Scale:  The resulting N (N ≥ 6) values for each peak at wavenumber, ν, 
should be averaged to obtain a single band wavenumber value (laboratory mean,  y ν), and the standard deviation of 
the values, sν, should be calculated.  In order to determine whether or not the laboratory measurements are biased 
relative to SRM 1921a, calculate the difference, δν, between the laboratory mean,  y ν, and the certified value, Cν, as 
follows: 
 

A practical limit for evaluating consistency with the certified value is: 
 

δν =  y ν - Cν

where Uuser is the user’s Type B evaluated expanded uncertainty [15] and U [1] is the uncertainty from Table 2.  If 
νδ δ>
should be corrected to the SRM.  If this is the case, generally a linear least squares fit of δν to ν for the 13 peaks should 
provide a sufficient correction to the spectrophotometer  scale.  However, if  |δν| ≤ δc, the  wavenumber scale of the 
spectrophotometer is considered to be accurate and correction is not advised.
