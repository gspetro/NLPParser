Certificate of Analysis 
Standard Reference Material 1546a 

Meat Homogenate 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended primarily for validation of methods for determining fatty acids, 
cholesterol, proximates, calories, elements, vitamins, and amino acids in canned meat products and similar materials.  
This SRM can also be used for quality assurance when assigning values to in-house reference materials.  The meat 
homogenate  is  a  mixture  of  pork  and  chicken  products  blended  together  in  a  commercial  process.    A  unit  of 
SRM 1546a consists of four cans, each containing approximately 85 g of material. 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values:  Certified mass fraction values for fatty acids, cholesterol, elements, and vitamins 
in SRM 1546a, reported on an as-received basis, are provided in Tables 1 through 4.  A NIST certified value is a value 
for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been 
investigated or taken into account [1].  Analyses for value assignment were performed by NIST and collaborating 
laboratories.  Certified values were calculated as the mean of the mean values from NIST methods and the median or 
mean of the means of results provided by collaborating laboratories, where appropriate.  The associated uncertainties 
are expressed at an approximately 95 % level of confidence [2–4]. 
 
Reference Mass Fraction Values:  Reference mass fraction values for additional fatty acids, elements, and vitamins, 
proximates,  calories,  and  amino  acids  in  SRM 1546a,  reported  on  an  as-received  basis,  are  provided  in  Tables 5 
through 9.  A NIST reference value is a noncertified value that is the best estimate of the true value based on available 
data; however, the value does not meet the NIST criteria for certification [1] and is provided with an uncertainty that 
may reflect only measurement reproducibility, may not include all sources of uncertainty, or may reflect a lack of 
sufficient statistical agreement among multiple analytical methods.  The reference mass fraction values were derived 
from results reported by NIST and/or collaborating laboratories. 
 
Information Mass Fraction Values:  An information  mass fraction value for taurine is provided in Table 10.  A 
NIST information value is a value that may be of interest to the SRM user, but insufficient information is available to 
assess the uncertainty associated with the value, therefore no uncertainty is provided [1].  Information values cannot 
be used to establish metrological traceability. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 1546a is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until  31 January 2024, provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  given  in  this 
certificate (see “Instructions for Storage and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, 
or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Coordination of the technical measurements leading to the certification of this SRM was performed by M.M. Phillips 
and  L.J. Wood  of  the  NIST  Chemical  Sciences  Division;  K.E. Sharpless  of  the  NIST  Special  Programs  Office; 
D. Howell and W. Koshute of the Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA, Washington, DC); and J. Roseland and 
K. Patterson of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA, Beltsville, MD).

NOTICE TO USERS:  SRM 1546a IS INTENDED FOR RESEARCH USE; NOT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE AND USE 
 
Storage:  The SRM should be stored at room temperature or under refrigeration in the original unopened cans.  The 
certification, which includes all value assignments, does not apply to contents of previously opened cans, because the 
stability of all analytes has not been investigated. 
 
One  technique 
Use:    Before  use,  the  contents  of  the  can  should  be  mixed  thoroughly  to  ensure  homogeneity.    One  technique 
recommended is to transfer the entire contents of a can to a plastic bag, then manually squeeze the bag to blend the 
material.  Care should be taken to avoid separating fat from the material.  To relate analytical determinations to the 
certified values in this Certificate of Analysis, the test portion mass indicated in the description of the NIST analyses 
for  each  group  of  analytes  below  should  be  used  (see  “Source,  Preparation,  and  Analysis”).    Results  obtained  in 
analyses should include their own estimates of uncertainty and can be compared to the listed values using procedures 
described in reference 5. 
 
SOURCE, PREPARATION, AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Source  and  Preparation:    SRM 1546a  is  a  mixture  of  pork,  mechanically-separated  chicken,  ham,  salt,  sucrose, 
water, and spices and was prepared by the Hormel Foods Corporation (Austin, MN), by a commercial process that 
quantity  of  sodium 
included cooking, grinding, blending, and sieving prior to canning under sterile conditions.  A small quantity of sodium 
nitrite was added as a preservative prior to canning. 
 
Analytical Approach for Determination of Fatty Acids:  Value assignment of the mass fractions of fatty acids in 
SRM 1546a was based on the combination of measurements made using two extraction procedures and two different 
analytical methods at NIST and by collaborating laboratories, where appropriate.  NIST provided results using gas 
chromatography (GC)  with  flame  ionization  detection (FID)  and  GC  with  mass  spectrometric (MS)  detection  as 
described below.  Value assignment of the cholesterol mass fraction was based on measurements made by NIST using 
an isotope dilution (ID) GC-MS method. 
 
NIST Analyses for Fatty Acids by GC-FID:  The mass fractions of fatty acids were determined by GC-FID from two 
1.5 g to 2.0 g test portions taken from each of 10 cans of SRM 1546a.  The meat homogenate and internal standard 
solution (tricosanoic acid, palmitic acid-d35, and myristic acid-d27) were mixed with diatomaceous earth in pressurized

combined  with  methanolic (m-trifluoromethylphenyl) 

fluid  extraction (PFE)  cells.    Following  PFE  with  hexane:dichloromethane:methanol  (70:25:5 volume  fraction) 
containing approximately 1 mg/g butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), sodium sulfate was added to absorb excess water.  
Extracts  were 
hydroxide 
(1:1 volume fraction), vortexed, and allowed to stand for at least 30 min prior to analysis by GC-FID.  GC-FID was 
performed  using  a  0.25 mm × 100 m  biscyanopropyl polysiloxane  fused  silica  capillary  column.    Calibrants  were 
prepared gravimetrically from SRM 2377 Fatty Acid Methyl Esters in 2,2,4-Trimethylpentane, at levels intended to 
approximate the levels of the fatty acids in the SRM following extraction.  A single internal standard solution was 
used for the calibrants and samples.  Calculations are based on average response factors for the calibrants. 
 
NIST Analyses for Fatty Acids by GC-MS:  The mass fractions of fatty acids were determined by GC-MS from one 
1.5 g to 2.0 g test portion from each of six cans of SRM 1546a.  The meat homogenate and internal standard solution 
(tricosanoic  acid,  palmitic  acid-d35,  and  myristic acid-d27)  were  mixed  with  diatomaceous  earth  in  PFE  cells.  
Following PFE with hexane:acetone (80:20 volume fraction) containing approximately 1 mg/g BHT, sodium sulfate 
was added to absorb excess water.  Extracts were combined with methanolic sodium hydroxide, blanketed with N2, 
capped, mixed, and heated in a dry bath at 100 °C for 30 min with gentle shaking every 10 min.  Extracts were cooled 
to 40 °C and fatty acids were extracted with 40 mg/L BHT in hexane and saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution.  
The  hexane/BHT  layer  was  removed  and  the  hexane/BHT  extraction  repeated  twice  and  combined  with  the  first 
extracted portion.  A subsample of the combined extracts was analyzed by GC-MS.  GC-MS was performed using a 
0.25 mm × 60  m  fused  silica  capillary column containing a cyanopropyl:methylpolysiloxane (50:50 mole  fraction) 
phase.  Calibrants were prepared gravimetrically from SRM 2377 Fatty Acid Methyl Esters in 2,2,4-Trimethylpentane, 
at  levels  intended  to  approximate  the  levels  of  the  fatty  acids  in  the  SRM  following  extraction.   A  single  internal 
standard solution was used for the calibrants and samples.  Calculations are based on average response factors for the 
calibrants. 
 
Analytical Approach for Determination of Cholesterol:  The mass fraction of cholesterol was measured using the 
ID-GC-MS method developed at NIST for serum cholesterol [6] and modified for the determination of cholesterol in 
food matrices using the approach in AOAC International Official Method 996.06 for hydrolysis [7].  One sample set 
consisted of single 2.0 g test  portions from each of  nine cans of SRM 1546a, weighed into Pyrex test tubes.  The 
second sample set consisted of single 1.0 g test portions from each of ten cans of SRM 1546a, weighed into Pyrex test 
tubes.  An aliquot of a solution containing a known mass of the internal standard, cholesterol-13C3, was added to each 
tube.    Cholesterol  esters  were  hydrolyzed  by  heating  the  samples  in  an  alcohol-KOH  solution  for  1 h  at  100 °C.  
Cholesterol was extracted into hexane, and a portion of the hexane extract was evaporated to dryness prior to addition 
of  N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide  to  convert  cholesterol  to  the  trimethylsilyl (TMS)  derivative.    GC-MS  was 
performed  using  a  30 m  phenyl:methyl polysiloxane  (5:95  mole  fraction)  non-polar  fused  silica  column  directly 
interfaced to the ion source.  Cholesterol was determined in the electron ionization mode with selected ion monitoring 
at  m/z 458  and  m/z 461  for  the  unlabeled  and  labeled  cholesterol-TMS,  respectively.    Calibrants  were  prepared 
gravimetrically, from SRM 911c Cholesterol, at levels intended to approximate the level of the cholesterol in the SRM 
following extraction.  A single internal standard solution was used for the calibrants and samples.  Calculations are 
based on linear regression analysis for the calibrants. 
 
Analytical Approach for Determination of Elements:  Value assignment of the mass fractions of the elements in 
SRM 1546a was based on the combination of results at NIST and collaborating laboratories, where appropriate.  NIST 
provided measurements by using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), inductively 
coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA), and thermal neutron 
prompt gamma-ray activation analysis (PGAA). 
 
NIST Analyses for Ba, Ca, Cl, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, P, Se, Sr, and Zn Using ICP-OES and/or ICP-MS:  The 
mass fractions of barium, calcium, chlorine, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, 
strontium, and zinc were measured by ICP-OES.  Barium, copper, manganese, molybdenum, selenium, and strontium 
were measured by ICP-MS.  Duplicate 3.5 g to 4.0 g test portions were taken from each of 10 cans of SRM 1546a and 
were digested in a microwave sample preparation system using nitric acid or a nitric acid/hydrofluoric acid mixture.  
Quantitation for ICP-OES and ICP-MS was based on the method of standard additions using SRM 3100 series single 
element standard solutions. 
 
NIST  Analyses  for  B  Using  PGAA:    The  mass  fraction  of  boron  was  determined  by  PGAA  from  individual  disks 
prepared from 1 g test portions taken from each of six cans of SRM 1546a.  Samples, controls, and standards, prepared 
from  SRM 3107  Boron (B)  Standard  Solution,  were  packaged  individually  in  clean  Teflon  bags  and  irradiated 
individually for less than 1 h.  Gamma-ray spectra up to 11 MeV were collected, and the boron gamma-ray signal at 
477 keV was monitored and compared to that of the standard to determine the mass fraction of boron. 
 
NIST Analyses for Cl, Na, Rb, and Se Using INAA:  The mass fractions of chlorine, rubidium, selenium, and sodium 
<s  that  were  prepared  from  0.4
were measured by INAA in individual disks that were prepared from 0.4 g test portions taken from each of six cans

were packaged individually in clean polyethylene bags and irradiated individually.  For determination of chlorine, 
samples  were  irradiated  at  20 MW  for  60 s  and  nuclides  were  counted  for  5 min  after  a  10 min  decay.    For 
determination of sodium, samples were irradiated at 20 MW for 60 s and nuclides were counted for 30 min after a 
40 min decay.  For determination of selenium and rubidium, samples were irradiated at 20 MW for 4 h and nuclides 
were counted for 8 h following a decay of several weeks. 
 
Analytical Approach for Determination of Vitamins:  Value assignment of the mass fractions of the vitamins in 
SRM 1546a  was  based  on  the  combination  of  results  provided  from  NIST  and  collaborating  laboratories,  where 
appropriate.  NIST provided measurements by using isotope dilution (ID) with liquid chromatography (LC) and mass 
spectrometry (MS) or tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). 
 
NIST  Analyses  for  Thiamine,  Riboflavin,  Niacinamide,  Niacin,  Pantothenic  Acid,  Pyridoxine,  and  Pyridoxamine:  
Mass  fractions  of  thiamine,  riboflavin,  niacinamide,  niacin,  pantothenic  acid,  pyridoxine,  and  pyridoxamine  were 
measured by ID-LC-MS/MS in duplicate 2 g test portions taken from each of ten cans of SRM 1546a.  The analytes 
and  internal  standards  were  extracted  into  ammonium  acetate  at  pH 2.6  for  analysis  by  positive  ion  mode 
ID-LC-MS/MS.  A gradient  method  with an ammonium  formate buffer/methanol  mobile phase and a C18 column 
were  used  for  ID-LC-MS/MS  determination  of  the  vitamins.    Calibrants  were  prepared  gravimetrically  at  levels 
intended  to  approximate  the  levels  of  the  vitamins  in  the  SRM  following  extraction.   The  purity  of  neat  calibrant 
materials  was  determined  at  NIST  using  LC-absorbance,  Karl  Fischer  titration,  thermogravimetric  analysis,  and 
differential scanning calorimetry.  A single internal standard solution was used for the calibrants and samples.  The 
analyte and internal standard transitions monitored for ID-LC-MS/MS are listed in Table 11. 
 
NIST Analyses for Choline and Carnitine:  Mass fractions of choline and carnitine were measured in duplicate 2.0 g 
test  portions  taken  from  each  of  ten cans  of  SRM 1546a.    An  aliquot  of  an  internal  standard  solution  containing 
2H9-choline  chloride  and  2H9-carnitine  hydrochloride  was  added  to  each  calibrant  and  sample.    The  analytes  and 
internal standards were extracted and hydrolyzed by microwave digestion in dilute hydrochloric acid for analysis by 
positive-ion  mode  LC-MS.    A  gradient  method  with  an  ammonium  formate/acetonitrile  mobile  phase  and  a 
mixed-mode C18 column were used for LC-MS determination.  Choline and 2H9-choline were measured at m/z 104 
and m/z 113, respectively.  Carnitine and 2H9-carnitine were measured at m/z 162 and m/z 171, respectively.  Calibrants 
were  prepared  gravimetrically,  at  levels  intended  to  approximate  the  levels  of  the  vitamins  in  the  SRM  following 
extraction.  The purity of neat calibrant materials was determined at NIST using quantitative proton nuclear magnetic 
resonance spectroscopy (qNMR).  A single internal standard solution was used for the calibrants and samples. 
 
NIST  Analyses  for  Vitamin D3  and  25-Hydroxyvitamin D3:    Mass  fractions  of  vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol)  and 
25-hydroxyvitamin D3  were  measured  in  duplicate  2.0 g  to  3.0 g  test  portions  taken  from  each  of  ten cans  of 
SRM 1546a.  Aliquots of internal standard solutions containing vitamin D3-13C5 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-13C5 were 
added to each calibrant and sample.  Prior to extraction, the samples of SRM 1546a were incubated with lipase at 
40 °C for 2 h to hydrolyze the fats.  Ethanol containing butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and potassium carbonate was 
added to each sample, and the analytes and internal standards were extracted into hexane containing BHT by overnight 
stirring.  The samples were centrifuged, the supernatants were decanted, and an additional aliquot of hexane containing 
BHT was added.  Samples were extracted further by a combination of sonication and rotary mixing, then centrifuged, 
and the supernatants combined with those from the previous extraction.  Two additional cycles of sonication and rotary 
mixing  were  conducted,  for  a  total  of  four  extractions.    The  pooled  organic  layers  were  dried  under  nitrogen  to 
approximately 40 mL and magnesium sulfate was added.  Following vortex mixing and centrifugation, the organic 
layer  was  decanted  and  evaporated 
  The  analytes  were  derivatized  with 
to  dryness  under  nitrogen. 
4-phenyl-1,2,4-triazoline-3,5-dione (PTAD) and reconstituted in a mixture of methanol and ethyl acetate for analysis 
by positive-ion mode LC-MS/MS.  A gradient method with a water/methanol mobile phase and a pentafluorophenyl 
column were used for LC-MS/MS determination.  Vitamin D3+PTAD and vitamin D3-13C5+PTAD were measured at 
transitions  m/z 560 → m/z 298  and  m/z 565 → m/z 298, 
  25-Hydroxyvitamin D3+PTAD  and 
25-hydroxyvitamin  D3-13C5+PTAD  were  measured  at  transitions  m/z 558 → m/z 298  and  m/z 563 → m/z 298, 
respectively.  Calibrants were prepared gravimetrically, at levels intended to approximate the levels of the vitamins in 
the  SRM  following  extraction.    The  purity  of  the  neat  vitamin D3  calibrant  material  was  determined  by  the 
manufacturer and confirmed at NIST using spectrophotometry.  The purity of the neat 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 calibrant 
material was determined at NIST using LC-absorbance, Karl Fischer titration, thermogravimetric analysis, and qNMR.  
A single internal standard solution was used for the calibrants and samples. 
 
Collaborating Laboratories’ Analyses:  The GMA FIACSG laboratories were asked to use their usual methods to 
make single measurements of fatty acids, cholesterol, proximates, calories, elements, vitamins, and amino acids on 
test portions taken from each of two cans of SRM 1546a.  Because of variability among data provided by laboratories 
participating in this interlaboratory comparison exercise, the median of laboratory means is used, with the uncertainty 
estimated  using  the  median  absolute  deviation (MADe) [8].    The  laboratories  participating  in  the  USDA 

respectively.

interlaboratory study were asked to use their usual methods to make single measurements of vitamin D and metabolites 
on test portions taken from each of three cans of SRM 1546a [9].  The mean of laboratory means is used, with the 
uncertainty estimated using the standard error of the mean of laboratory means.  The methods used by collaborating 
laboratories are indicated below. 
 
Homogeneity Assessment:  The homogeneity of fatty acids, cholesterol, elements, and vitamins was assessed at NIST 
using  the  methods  and  test  portion  sizes  described  above.    Analysis  of  the  variance  showed  statistically  
significant heterogeneity in some cases, and the uncertainties for barium, calcium, pantothenic acid, pyridoxamine, 
pyridoxine, riboflavin, sodium, strontium, thiamine, and total vitamin B6 as pyridoxine all incorporate an uncertainty 
component for possible heterogeneity.  Homogeneity of constituents measured solely by collaborating laboratories 
(e.g.,  proximates,  amino acids)  was  not  assessed,  although  the  data  were  treated  as  though  these  analytes  were 
homogeneously distributed. 
 
Value Assignment:  For calculation of assigned values for analytes that were measured only by NIST, the mean of 
the mean values from NIST results was used.  The collaborating laboratories reported the individual results for each 
of their analyses for a given analyte.  The mean of each laboratory’s results was then determined.  For calculation of 
assigned values for analytes that were measured only by the GMA FIACSG laboratories, the median of the laboratory 
means was used.  For analytes that were also measured by NIST, the mean of the individual sets of NIST data were 
averaged with the median of the individual GMA FIACSG laboratory means or the mean of the USDA laboratory 
means, as appropriate. 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values for Fatty Acids as Free Fatty Acids:  Each certified mass fraction value is the 
combined mean from the mean of NIST GC-MS data, the mean of NIST GC-FID data, and the median of the means 
of  results  provided  by  collaborating  laboratories,  where  appropriate.    The  method  reported  by  collaborating 
laboratories was GC-FID.  The uncertainty provided with each value is an expanded uncertainty about the mean to 
cover the measurand with approximately 95 % confidence.  The expanded uncertainty is calculated as U = kuc, where 
uc  incorporates  the  observed  difference  between  the  results  from  the  methods  and  their  respective  uncertainties 
consistent with the JCGM Guide and with its Supplement 1, and k is a coverage factor corresponding to approximately 
95 % confidence [2–4].  The measurand is the total mass fraction for each fatty acid listed in Table 1 on an as-received 
basis.  Metrological traceability is to the SI derived unit for mass fraction (expressed as grams per 100 grams).

Certified Mass Fraction Value for Cholesterol:  The certified mass fraction for cholesterol is the mean of results 
obtained by NIST using ID-GC-MS.  The uncertainty provided with the value is an expanded uncertainty about the 
mean  to  cover  the  measurand  with  approximately  95 %  confidence.    The  expanded  uncertainty  is  calculated  as 
U = kuc,  where  uc  represents  the  combined  uncertainty  consistent  with  the  JCGM  Guide  and  with  its 
Supplement 1, and k is a coverage factor corresponding to approximately 95 % confidence [2,3].  The uncertainty for 
cholesterol  incorporates  Type B  uncertainties  for  purity  of  the  reference  compound,  completeness  of  hydrolysis, 
stability of cholesterol in base, and the difference between the certification set of data and a confirming set of data 
using a different GC column and different ions.  The measurand is the total mass fraction for cholesterol as listed in 
Table 2 on an as-received basis.  Metrological traceability is to the SI derived unit for mass fraction (expressed as 
milligrams per gram).

Certified Mass Fraction Values for Elements:  Each certified mass fraction value is the combined mean from the 
mean of results from analyses by NIST and the median of the means of results provided by collaborating laboratories, 
where appropriate.  The uncertainty provided with each value is an expanded uncertainty about the mean to cover the 
measurand  with  approximately  95 %  confidence.    The  expanded  uncertainty  is  calculated  as  U = kuc,  where  uc 
incorporates the observed difference between the results from the methods and their respective uncertainties consistent 
with the JCGM Guide and with its Supplement 1, and k is a coverage factor corresponding to approximately 95 % 
confidence [2–4].   The  uncertainty  for  sodium  also  incorporates  an  additional  uncertainty  component  for  possible 
inhomogeneity.  The measurand is the total mass fraction for each element listed in Table 3 on an as-received basis.
