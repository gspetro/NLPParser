Standard Reference Material 1828c 
 
Ethanol-Water Solutions (Six Levels) 
 
 
This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  a  set  of  six  levels  of  ethanol (ethyl  alcohol:  Chemical  Abstracts 
Service [CAS]  Registry  Number  64-17-5).    SRM 1828c  is  intended  for  use  in  the  calibration  of  instruments  and 
techniques used for the determination of ethanol in aqueous solutions.  A unit of SRM 1828c consists of six 2 mL 
ampoules, one ampoule each of the  nominal ethanol  mass fractions of 0.02 %, 0.04 %, 0.08 %, 0.1 %, 0.2 %, and 
0.3 %.  Each ampoule contains approximately 1.2 mL of solution.   
 
Certified Values:  The certified mass fraction values expressed as percent and associated uncertainties for each of the 
six solutions are given in Table 1.  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its 
accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or accounted for by NIST [1]. The 
certified values are based on the agreement of results obtained at NIST using two analytical techniques.   
 
Information Values:  Information values for the density at 20 °C for each of the six solutions are given in Table 2. 
An information value is a value that will be of interest to the SRM user, but insufficient information is available to 
assess the uncertainty associated with the value or only a limited number of analyses were performed [1].  Information 
values cannot be used to establish metrological traceability.  
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 1828c is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until  30 April 2037,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  given  in  this 
certificate (see “Instructions for Handling, Storage, and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, 
contaminated, or otherwise modified.  
 
If  substantive 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Coordination  of  the  technical  measurements  leading  to  the  certification  of  this  SRM  was  under  the  direction  of 
J.A. Murray and W.A. MacCrehan of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division. 
 
Preparation  of  and  analytical  measurements  on  the  SRM  were  performed  by  J. Murray  and  B. Lang  of  the  NIST 
Chemical Sciences Division. 
 
Statistical consultation and evaluation of the data were provided by N.-F. Zhang, of the NIST Statistical Engineering 
Division.

Materials.

rE  AND  USE 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE AND USE 
 
Handling:  The solutions contain ethanol in water at the stated concentrations.  Use proper disposal methods. 
 
Storage:  Sealed ampoules, as received, should be stored in the dark at temperatures between 10 °C and 30 °C. 
 
Use:    Sample  aliquots  for  analysis  should  be  withdrawn  immediately  after  opening  the  ampoules  and  should  be 
processed without delay for the certified values in Table 1 to be valid within the stated uncertainty.  Because of the 
volatility of ethanol, the certified values are NOT applicable to material stored in ampoules that have been opened for 
more than 2 min, even if they are resealed. 
 
Metrological Traceability for Certified Values:  The certified mass fraction of ethanol for each of the six solutions 
through 
is given in Table 1.  Metrological traceability is to the SI derived unit for mass fraction, expressed as percent, through 
aization
the  mass  balance  purity  assessment  of  neat  material,  determined  by  gas  chromatography  with  flame  ionization 
detection  (GC-FID)  using  two  separate  columns  and  Karl  Fischer  analysis,  and  the  certified  value  of  SRM 2897a 
Ethanol-Water Solution (Nominal Mass Fraction 2 %) used to prepare calibrants.

(a) Values are expressed as x ± U95%(x), where x is the certified mass fraction value (expressed as percent) and U95%(x) is the 
expanded uncertainty of the certified value [2,3]. The true value of the analyte is believed to lie within the interval x ± U95%(x) 
with 95 % confidence. To propagate this uncertainty, treat the certified values as a normally distributed random variable with 
mean x and standard deviation U95%(x)/2.

PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
The solutions were prepared at NIST by weighing and mixing known masses of ethanol and organic-free water.  Each 
solution was mixed a minimum of 12 h.  Aliquots of 1.2 mL were dispensed into 2 mL amber glass ampoules that had 
been evacuated with argon and then flame sealed.  
 
Aliquots from twelve ampoules, selected using a random stratified sampling scheme, were analyzed in duplicate by 
using  GC-FID  on  a  relatively  polar  DB-wax  column,  15 m × 0.45 mm id,  0.85 µm  film  thickness (Agilent 
Technologies,  Wilmington, DE).    The  internal  standard  added  to  each  sample  for  quantification  purposes  was 
1-propanol.  Calibration solutions consisting of weighed amounts of ethanol and the internal standard compound in 
organic-free water were chromatographically analyzed to determine analyte response factors.  The ethanol used to 
prepare  the  calibration  solutions  were  adjusted  for  the  mass  balance  purity  estimation  of  the  ethanol,  which  was 
determined  using  GC-FID  with  two  stationary  phases  of  different  polarities,  and  Karl  Fischer  analysis  for  water 
content.  
 
In  addition  to  the  GC-FID  analyses,  the  mass  fraction  of  each  of  the  six  solutions  was  determined  by  using  gas 
chromatography-mass  spectrometry  (GC-MS)  on  an  Rxi-1301Sil  MS  column,  60 m  x  0.25 mm  id,  1.0 µm  film 
thickness (Restek  Technologies,  Bellefonte,  PA).    The  internal  standard  added  to  each  sample  for  quantification 
purposes  was  1-propanol.    Calibration  solutions  consisting  of  weighed  amounts  of  SRM 2897a  and  the  internal 
standard compound in organic-free water were chromatographically analyzed to determine analyte response factors.  
Aliquots from six ampoules were analyzed in duplicate by GC-MS.  
 
The density of all six solutions was estimated at 20 °C using a density meter with an oscillating U-tube sensor.
