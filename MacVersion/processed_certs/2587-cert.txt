Certificate of Analysis 
Standard Reference Material® 2587 

 

 
Trace Elements in Soil Containing Lead from Paint 
(Nominal 3000 mg/kg Lead) 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended for use in the evaluation of methods and for the calibration of 
apparatus used to determine lead and other trace elements in soil.  SRM 2587 is composed of soil samples collected 
from  a  suburban  garden  known  to  have  been  contaminated  by  lead-based  house  paint.    All  values  are  reported  as 
mass fractions [1], on a dry-mass basis and are based on measurements using a sample mass of at least 200 mg.  A 
unit consists of approximately 55 g of material with a particle size of <75 μm (200 mesh).  
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values:  The certified values for four environmentally important elements are provided in 
Table 1.    A  NIST  certified  value  is  a  value  for  which  NIST  has  the  highest  confidence  in  its  accuracy  in  that  all 
known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or accounted for by NIST. 
 
Reference Mass Fraction Values:  Reference values for 14 additional elements are provided in Table 2.  Reference 
values  are  noncertified  values  that  are  the  best  estimate  of  the  true  value;  however,  the  values  do  not  meet  NIST 
criteria for certification and are provided with associated uncertainties that may reflect only measurement precision 
and may not include all sources of uncertainty. 
 
Information Mass Fraction Values:  Information values are listed in Table 3.  These values may be of interest to 
the  SRM  user;  however,  insufficient  information  is  available  to  adequately  assess  the  uncertainty  associated  with 
these values. 
 
Expiration  of  Certification:    The  certification  of  SRM 2587  is  valid,  within  the  uncertainty  specified,  until 
30 September 2023,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  given  in  this 
certificate (see “Instructions for Storage, Handling, and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, 
contaminated, or otherwise modified.  
 
Maintenance  of  SRM  Certification:    NIST  will  monitor  this  SRM  over  the  period  of  its  certification.    If 
substantive  technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will 
notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
Partial  financial  support  for  the  development  of  this  SRM  was  provided  by  the  U.S.  Environmental  Protection 
Agency (EPA)  under  the  direction  of  project  manager  B. Schumacher  of  the  EPA  National  Exposure  Research 
Laboratory, Las Vegas, NV. 
 
The overall direction and coordination of the technical measurements leading to the certification of this SRM were 
performed by R.L. Watters, Jr. and G.C. Turk of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division. 
 
Statistical consultation was provided by L.M. Gill of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division. 
 
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Office  or  Reference 
Materials.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE, HANDLING, AND USE 
 
Use:  To relate analytical determinations to the certified values on this Certificate of Analysis, a minimum sample 
mass of 200 mg should be used and the sample should be dried according to the “Instructions for Drying”.  Sample 
preparation procedures should also be designed to effect complete dissolution in order to relate the determined value 
to  the  certified  value.    The  SRM  must  be  stored  in  its  original  bottle  at  temperatures  less  than  30 °C  away  from 
fumes and direct sunlight. 
 
Instructions  for  Drying:    Samples  should  be  oven  dried  for  2 h  at  105 °C.    For  the  determination  of  volatile 
elements (arsenic and mercury), samples should be analyzed as received; separate samples should be dried according 
to  these  instructions  to  obtain  a  correction  factor  for  moisture.    Moisture  corrections  are  then  made  to  the 
measurement results before comparing them to the certified values.  This alternative drying method may also be used 
for nonvolatile elements. 
 
Certified  Mass  Fraction  Values  and  Uncertainties:    Certified  values  and  uncertainties  are  provided  in  Table 1. 
The  certified  values  are  based  on  results  from  two  or  more  NIST  independent  analytical  methods  and  additional 
results  from  methods  used  at  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey (USGS) (Table 4).    All  values  are  reported  as  mass 
fractions [1], on a dry basis (see “Instructions for Drying”), and are based on measurements using a sample mass of 
at least 200 mg.

The certified values are equally weighted means from the combination of results provided by NIST and USGS.  The 
uncertainty is calculated as, U = kuc+ B.  The quantity uc is the combined standard uncertainty calculated according 
to the ISO and NIST Guides [2] and is intended to represent, at the level of one standard deviation, the combined 
effect  of  within-method  variation  and  material  inhomogeneity.    The  coverage  factor,  k,  is  determined  from  the 
Student-t distribution corresponding to the calculated effective degrees of freedom and 95 % level of confidence for 
each element.  B is a bias adjustment for the difference between methods, which is the maximum difference between 
the certified value and method means [3]. 
 
Reference  Mass  Fraction  Values  and  Uncertainties:    Reference  values  and  uncertainties  are  given  in  Table 2.  
The  reference  value  for  Hg  is  derived  from  a  single  method  performed  at  NIST.    The  reference  values  for  the 
remaining elements are derived from two or more methods performed at NIST and/or USGS.

COLLECTION, PREPARATION, AND ANALYSIS 
 
Collection:    Soil  material  used  in  the  preparation  of  SRM 2587  was  collected  from  a  suburban  residence  in  the 
Hartford, CT area known to be contaminated by lead-based paint.  The soil was collected within the top 25 cm 
after  surficial  organic  material  had  been  removed.    Visual  inspection  of  the  collected  soil  revealed  moderate 
quantities of partially decomposed organic matter as well as minor amounts of masonry debris.  Uncontaminated soil 
from the Boston, MA area was collected for use as a diluent.  
 
Preparation:    The  preparation  of  SRM 2587  was  performed  at  the  USGS  laboratory  in  Denver, CO,  under  the 
direction of S.A. Wilson.  The collected soils were dried at room temperature for 5 days, disaggregated, and sieved. 
The  material  with  particle  size  under  2 mm  was  collected  in  20 L  containers  and  chemically  analyzed.    The 
information from this preliminary analysis was then used to combine and blend the sub-sets into a single set with a 
target  lead  concentration  of  3000 mg/kg.    The  blended  mixture  was  ground  to  <75 μm (200 mesh)  using  a 
Hardinger(1) ball mill equipped with an air separator system and  mixed for 20 hours using a cross-flow V-blender.  
The material was then split into 8 kg aliquots and sterilized using Co-60 irradiation.  After sterilization the material 
was re-combined, blended for 3 h, and bottled. 
 
Analysis:    Certification  analyses  were  performed  in  the  NIST  Chemical  Sciences  Division  and  at  USGS.    The 
analytical methods used and the analysts are listed in Table 4. 

                                                            
(1) Certain commercial equipment, instruments, or materials are identified in this report to specify adequately the experimental 
procedure.  Such identification does not imply recommendation or endorsement by NIST, nor does it imply that the materials or 
equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the purpose.

User  Experience  with  SRM 2587:    In  order  to  demonstrate  user  experience  with  SRM 2587,  a  number  of 
laboratories analyzed this material, using a variety of dissolution and instrumental methods.  For lead, this was done 
through the Environmental Lead Proficiency Analytical Testing Program (ELPAT), where SRM 2587 was included 
as an unknown for Round Robin number 12.  Data for As, Cd, Cr, and Hg, were supplied by volunteer laboratories 
in  a  round  robin  exercise  organized  by  NIST.    The  sample  preparation  methods  include  EPA-SW846-3050A, 
EPA-SW846-3051 [4]  and  others.    As  these  methods  may  not  effect  complete  sample  dissolution,  the  results 
obtained  using  these  methods  tend  to  be  lower  than  the  certified  values.    The  results  are  summarized  in  Table 5. 
These results were not used in calculating the certified values of SRM 2587.
