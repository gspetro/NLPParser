Raman  Spectroscopy: 
Relative Intensity Correction Standard for Raman Spectroscopy: 
532 nm Excitation 

 
This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  a  certified  spectroscopic  standard  for  the  correction  of  the  relative 
intensity  of  Raman  spectra  obtained  with  instruments  employing  532 nm  laser  excitation.    A  unit  of  SRM 2242a 
consists of an optical glass slide that emits a broadband luminescence spectrum when excited at 532 nm.  This SRM 
is approximately 10 mm in width × 10 mm in length × 1.65 mm in thickness, with both surfaces optically polished, 
and furnished with two mounts.  The relative spectral intensity of the glass luminescence has been determined using 
a  white-light,  uniform-source,  integrating  sphere  calibrated  at  NIST  for  its  irradiance.    The  shape  of  the  mean 
luminescence  spectrum  of  this  glass  is  described  by  a  mathematical  expression  that  relates  the  relative  spectral 
intensity to the wavenumber (cm-1) expressed as the Raman shift from the excitation laser wavelength.  This model, 
together with a measurement of the luminescence spectrum of the standard, can be used to determine the spectral 
intensity  response  correction  that  is  unique  to  each  Raman  system.    The  resulting  instrument  intensity  response 
correction may then be used to obtain Raman spectra that are largely free from instrument-induced spectral artifacts. 
 
Certified Values:  A NIST certified value [1] represents a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its 
The
accuracy  in  that  all  known  or  suspected  sources  of  bias  have  been  fully  investigated  or  taken  into  account.    The 
measurand is relative luminescence measured as a function of Raman shift (cm‐1) from the laser excitation wavelength 
of 532 nm.  Metrological traceability is to the NIST spectral irradiance scale. 
 
Equation 1 defines a log-normal model used to describe the mean shape of the SRM 2242a luminescence spectrum 
when  excited  at  532 nm.    Table 1  lists  the  certified  values  of  the  coefficients  of  Equation  1.    Figure 1  shows  the 
spectrum and its associated 95 % level of confidence expanded confidence and prediction uncertainty bands. 
 
The dependent variable of this model is the relative spectral intensity of the luminescence.  The independent variable 
of this model is the wavenumber expressed in units of Raman shift (cm-1) from the laser excitation wavelength of 
532 nm.    This  model  is  certified  to  describe  the  luminescent  response  of  the  SRM  when  it  is  measured  in  the 
temperature range of 20 °C to 25 °C.  This model certifies the shape of the luminescence spectrum between 150 cm-1 
and 4000 cm-1 Raman shift for excitation with a 532 nm laser. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 2242a is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until 31 December 2024, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given in this 
certificate (see “Instructions for Handling, Storage, and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, 
contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Production and certification of this SRM were performed by A.A. Urbas of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division.  
The glass was produced, cut and polished by A. Kirchhoff of the NIST Fabrication Technology Division.   
 
Statistical consultation was provided by D.V. Samarov of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division.  Support aspects 
involved in the issuance of this SRM were coordinated through the NIST Office of Reference Materials. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
changes occur  that  affect  the  certification before  the  expiration of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the  purchaser.  
Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification.

Raman  Shift  (cm)

Figure 1.  Certified, linearly shifted log-normal model describing the luminescence spectrum of SRM 2242a when 
excited at 532 nm.  The horizontal axis has dimensions of Raman shift (cm-1).  The vertical axis is on a relative scale 
and normalized to unity with the dimensions of number of photons per second per square centimeter per wavenumber.  
The dashed lines (---) represent an approximate 95 % confidence band for the spectrum.  The wider, dotted lines (···), 
are  the  corresponding  95 %  prediction  band  for  individual  spectra  measured  using  methods  and  instruments

SRM 2242a

Physical Description:  SRM 2242a is a manganese-doped (0.15 wt % MnO2) borate matrix glass.  One mount is a 
12.5 mm square cuvette-style optical mount.  This mount is designed for the typical 12.5 mm sampling accessories 
widely used in chemical spectroscopy.  The glass slide is retained in a slot on the front face of the holder.  Two plastic 
springs,  also  retained  in  the  slot,  hold  the  glass  slide  in  place  while  allowing  for  positioning  within  the  slot  to 
accommodate different beam heights.  Grooves on the sides of the slot require that the glass slide and springs be loaded 
into the slot from the bottom of the holder.  The other mount is a 2.5 cm × 7.6 cm × 0.3 cm microscope slide-style 
holder.  On the top face is a rectangular slot to retain the glass slide over a circular aperture in the center of the holder.  
Two plastic springs serve to hold the glass slide in the slot centered over the circular aperture.  Removal of the SRM 
glass for measurements that are physically hindered by the holders does not alter the certified properties of this SRM. 
 
The glass matrix of SRM 2242a is susceptible to corrosion when exposed to water vapor for extended periods of time.  
Storage  at  high  relative  humidity (RH)  or  direct  contact  with  liquid  water  can  rapidly  deteriorate  the  surface.    To 
improve stability, a bilayer nanolaminate was deposited on the glass substrate to serves as a moisture barrier.  The thin 
film with applied to the substrates by atomic layer deposition (ALD) and consists of a base layer of 30 nm Al2O3 with 
a 20 nm SiO2 capping layer.  While this moisture barrier greatly reduces humidity related surface corrosion it does not 
prevent it.  Due to the potential use of these SRMs on microscope systems with high magnification objectives, thicker 
films that may offer superior performance were not investigated.  The emission profile of the coated and uncoated 
units could not be distinguished on a confocal Raman microscope using a 50X objective.   
 
Measurement Conditions:  The certification measurements of the luminescence spectrum of SRM 2242a were made 
using two spectrometer systems: one commercial micro-Raman spectrometer system operated in a 180° backscatter 
geometry and one home-built Raman system that utilized two spectrograph and detector combinations.  Measurements 
on  all  instruments  were  conducted  in  a  180°  backscatter  geometry.    Two  diode-pumped  continuous  wave  laser 
excitation sources were used with nominal laser wavelength of 532.2 nm.  Laser excitation wavelength was measured 
periodically  using  a  wavemeter.    Longpass  edge  filters  were  utilized  for  Rayleigh  rejection  on  all  systems.    The 
absolute wavenumber axis of each spectrometer was calibrated using emission lines from low-pressure pen lamps.  
The y-axis (relative spectral intensity) of each system was calibrated with a white-light, uniform-source, integrating 
sphere  that  had  been  calibrated  for  irradiance  at  NIST.    Most  certification  data  were  acquired  at  nominal  room 
temperature,  which  typically  varied  from  22 °C  to  23 °C.    Additional  measurements  were  conducted  with  sample 
temperature control from 20 °C to 25 °C. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE  
 
Handling and Storage:  When not in use, the SRM should be stored in the container provided or in one providing 
comparable mechanical protection.  Although not recommended, the glass standard may be removed from its mount 
without altering the certified properties of the glass.  The glass substrate is susceptible to surface corrosion when 
exposed to elevated levels of humidity.  Therefore, when not in use it is strongly recommended that the SRM 
unit be stored in an environment with a stable humidity of 20 % or lower. 
 
Use:  SRM 2242a is used to provide 532 nm laser excitation Raman spectra corrected for relative intensity; it is not 
intended for use as a standard for the determination of absolute spectral irradiance or radiance. 
 
For user convenience, a spreadsheet containing the coefficients of the certified model, confidence band and prediction 
interval as well as an example relative spectral intensity correction calculation can be obtained at 
https://www-s.nist.gov/srmors/view_datafiles.cfm?srm=2242a. 
 
This  SRM  is  intended  for  use  in  measurements  in  the  temperature  range  of  20 °C  to  25 °C.    Use  of  this  SRM  at 
temperatures other than the certification temperature is not supported.  This SRM was shown to be photostable under 
extended exposure to approximately 50 mW of 532 nm laser light focused through a 50X magnification microscope 
objective.    While  it  is  expected  that  higher  power  densities  could  be  used  without  incurring  damage,  this  is  not 
recommended. 
 
Correcting the Raman spectrum of a sample requires a measurement of the SRM 2242a luminescence spectrum on the 
Raman instrument and then a mathematical treatment of both this luminescence spectrum and the observed Raman 
spectrum of the sample.  For proper use, attention must be paid to the following experimental conditions: (1) The 
spectrometer laser and x-axis should be calibrated using the manufacturer’s recommended methods.  (2) Validation 
of the Raman shift axis may be accomplished by referring to ASTM E1840-96 [2].  It should be noted that the shape 
of the spectral luminescence may have some sensitivity to the placement of the glass surface relative to the illumination 
and collection optics of the spectrometer.  (3) Measurement conditions should be arranged to furnish a spectrum of 
optimum signal-to-noise ratio of the SRM.  (4) The luminescence spectrum must be acquired over the same Raman 
range as that of the sample.

The relative intensity of the measured Raman spectrum of the sample can be corrected for the instrument-specific 
response by a computational procedure that uses a correction curve.  A detailed description of this procedure for the 
intensity correction of Raman spectra can be found in references [3–5].  This curve is generated using the certified 
coefficient values for the model defined in Equation 1 and the measured luminescence spectrum of the SRM glass.  
For the spectral range of certification, ∆υ  =  150 cm-1 to 4000 cm-1, compute the elements of the certified relative 
mean spectral intensity of SRM 2242a, ISRM(∆υ), using the same data point spacing used for the acquisition of the 
luminescence spectrum of the SRM and of the Raman spectrum of the sample.  ISRM(∆υ) has been normalized to unity 
and is a relative unit expressed in photons per second per square centimeter per wavenumber.  The data sets that are 
the measured glass luminescence spectrum, SSRM(∆υ), and the measured Raman spectrum of the sample, SMEAS(∆υ), 
must have the units of Raman shift (cm-1).  The elements of the correction curve ICORR(∆υ), defined by Equation 2, are 
obtained from ISRM(∆υ) and the elements of the glass luminescence spectrum, SSRM(∆υ), by 
 

ICORR(∆υ)  =  ISRM(∆υ) / SSRM(∆υ). 

 
The elements of the intensity-corrected Raman spectrum, SCORR(∆υ), are derived by multiplication of the elements of 
the measured Raman spectrum of the sample, SMEAS(∆υ), by the elements of the correction curve: 
 

SCORR(∆υ)  =  SMEAS(∆υ)  •  ICORR(∆υ). 

 
The Table 1 coefficients are certified for use between 150 cm-1 and 4000 cm-1.  The certified model is intended as a 
simple numerical descriptor of the spectral response observed over the wavenumber range studied.  It is not claimed 
to be physically meaningful.  Extrapolation of the model outside the certification limits of 150 cm-1 and 4000 cm-1 
is not a supported use of this SRM.   
 
Luminescence Spectrum on the Wavelength Scale:  The equation describing the mean luminescence spectrum of 
the glass SRM is given in Equation 1, where ∆υ is the Raman shift in units of wavenumbers (cm-1).  For correction of 
spectra  where  the  x-axis  is  in  wavelength  with  units  of  nanometers,  the  same  model  coefficients  can  be  used  to 
calculate ISRM(λ) through the following transformation:
