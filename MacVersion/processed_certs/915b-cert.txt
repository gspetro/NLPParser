Certificate of Analysis 
 
Standard Reference Material 915b 
 
Calcium Carbonate 
 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended for use as an analytical standard of known purity.  It is intended 
primarily for use in the calibration and standardization of procedures for calcium (Ca) determinations employed in 
clinical analysis and for routine critical evaluation of the daily working standards used in these procedures.  This lot 
of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) was prepared to ensure a material of high purity and homogeneity and has been assayed 
after heating at 200 °C to 210 °C.  A unit of SRM 915b consists of a single glass bottle containing 20 g of the material. 
 
Certified Values:  Table 1 lists the certified values for this SRM, expressed as mass fractions, w, of CaCO3, Ca, and 
2-).  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that 
carbonate (CO3
all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [1].  The measurands are the mass 
fractions  for  Ca,  CO3,  and  CaCO3.    Metrological  traceability  is  to  the  SI  units  for  mass,  current,  and  time  in  the 
coulometric assay and to the SI unit for mass in the gravimetric assay.

(a) Each result is expressed as the certified value ± the expanded uncertainty, U, calculated as U = kuc, where uc is the combined 
standard uncertainty calculated according to the ISO/JCGM and NIST Guides [2].  The value of uc is intended to represent, at 
the level of one standard deviation, the combined effect of inherent sources of uncertainty of the assay techniques, and applicable 
corrections for interfering trace elements.  The value of k is 2, which is the coverage factor corresponding to approximately 95 % 
confidence based on > 60 overall effective degrees of freedom.

Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 915b is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until  01 March 2026,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  given  in  this 
certificate  (see  “Instructions  for  Use”).    The  certification  is  nullified  if  the  SRM  is  damaged,  contaminated,  or 
otherwise modified. 
 
Coulometric  and  gravimetric  analyses  were  performed  by  K.W. Pratt  and  T.W. Vetter,  respectively,  of  the  NIST 
Chemical Sciences Division.  Trace element analyses by glow-discharge mass spectrometry and other techniques [3] 
were performed by commercial laboratories.

Information  Values:    Table 2  lists  information  values  for  the  mass  fractions  of  trace  elements  in  SRM 915b.  
Information  values  are  non-certified  values  that  may  be  of  interest  and  use  to  the  SRM  user,  but  insufficient 
information is available to provide an uncertainty associated with the value [1].  No other elements were detected at a 
mass fraction greater than 1 µg/g.  Information values cannot be used to establish metrological traceability.

Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM lot over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST will notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
NOTICE AND WARNINGS TO USERS 
 
This SRM is intended for research use. 
 
Stability and Storage:  This SRM should be stored in its original bottle at room temperature.  It  must be tightly 
ture  and  acid  vapors.
re-capped after use and protected from moisture and acid vapors. 
 
Homogeneity:  This SRM is homogeneous within the uncertainty limits for the nominal sample mass, 150 mg, used 
for the coulometric assays.  Samples less than 150 mg are not recommended in order to avoid possible heterogeneity 
with smaller sample sizes. 
 
Possible Interfering Species:  It is the responsibility of the user to evaluate  which species may interfere with the 
application  of  this  SRM  and  to  apply  any  necessary  corrections  that  affect  the  given  application.    The  following 
information and the values in Table 2 may be useful in this evaluation. 
 
The  certified  value  for  wCaCO3  is  obtained  from  an  equally-weighted  combination  of  the  results  of  independent 
coulometric analyses, corrected for trace impurities of strontium carbonate (SrCO3), magnesium carbonate (MgCO3), 
sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), barium carbonate (BaCO3), and calcium hydrogen phosphate (CaHPO4); and gravimetric 
analyses, corrected for trace impurities of SrCO3, MgCO3, and Na2CO3. 
 
The  certified  value  for  wCa  is  obtained  from  an  equally-weighted  combination  of  wCa  obtained  directly  from  the 
gravimetric analyses and the indirect wCa, which is calculated from the stoichiometric amount of Ca expected from 
the  coulometric  wCO3  plus  the  additional  Ca  in  the  trace  impurities  of  calcium  sulfate (CaSO4),  calcium

The  corrections  for  trace  impurities  were  obtained  from  the  trace  element  determinations  and  the  appropriate 
gravimetric factors [4].  A portion of the Ca is present in SRM 915b as CaSO4, CaCl2, and CaHPO4, and a portion of 
2- is present as SrCO3, MgCO3, Na2CO3, and BaCO3.  Hence, the sum of the certified values for wCa and wCO3 
the CO3
does not equal the certified value for wCaCO3. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 
 
Drying  Instructions:    Dry  the  material  at  200 °C  to 210 °C  for  4 h.   After  the  SRM  has  been  dried,  store  it  in  a 
desiccator over anhydrous magnesium perchlorate. 
 
Source of Material:  The CaCO3 used for this SRM was obtained from a commercial supplier.  The material was 
examined  for  compliance  with  the  specification  for  reagent  grade  CaCO3 as  specified  by  the  American  Chemical 
Society [3].  The material was found to meet or exceed the minimum requirements in every respect. 
 
Assay  Techniques: 
  The  coulometric  assay  value  was  obtained  by  automated  back-titration [5]  using 
coulometrically-standardized hydrochloric acid (HCl) as the excess added substance, with potentiometric detection of 
the strong acid endpoint after removal of the product carbon dioxide (CO2).  The gravimetric assay value was obtained 
by  conversion  to  CaSO4  and  correcting  for  trace  contaminants  in  the  CaSO4  (gravimetric  procedure  based  on 
reference 6).
