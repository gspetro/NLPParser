Standard Reference Material® 1947 
 
Lake Michigan Fish Tissue 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is a frozen fish tissue homogenate that was prepared from fish collected 
from  Lake  Michigan,  and  is  intended  primarily  for  use  in  evaluating  analytical  methods  for  the  determination  of 
selected  trace  elements,  methylmercury,  total  mercury,  polychlorinated  biphenyl (PCB)  congeners,  chlorinated 
pesticides,  polybrominated  diphenyl  ether (PBDE)  congeners,  perfluoroalkyl  acids (PFAAs),  proximates, 
α-hexabromocyclododecane (α-HBCD), caloric content, and fatty acids in fish tissue and similar matrices.  All of the 
constituents for which certified, reference, and information mass fraction values are provided are naturally present in 
the fish tissue homogenate.  A unit of SRM 1947 consists of five bottles, each containing approximately eight grams 
(wet basis) of frozen tissue homogenate. 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values:  Certified mass fraction values are provided in Table 1 for selected trace elements 
including total  mercury and methylmercury.  Certified  mass fraction values are provided in Tables 2 through 4 for 
selected PCB congeners, chlorinated pesticides, and PBDE congeners.  The certified values for trace elements, PCBs, 
and chlorinated pesticides are based on results obtained from two or more independent analytical techniques.  A NIST 
certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that all known or suspected 
sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [1]. 
 
Reference Values:  Reference mass fraction values are provided in Table 5 for additional PCB congeners, chlorinated 
pesticides, PBDE congeners, and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS).  Reference values are provided for proximates, 
caloric content, selected fatty acids In Tables 6 and 7.  Reference Values for Hg Isotope Ratio Differences in SRM 1947 
are shown in Table 8.  Reference values are noncertified values that represent the best estimate of the true values based 
on  available  data;  however,  the  values  do  not  meet  the  NIST  criteria  for  certification [1]  and  are  provided  with 
associated uncertainties that may reflect only measurement reproducibility, may not include all sources of uncertainty, 
or may reflect a lack of sufficient statistical agreement among multiple analytical methods. 
 
 
Information Mass Fraction Values:  Information mass fraction values are provided in Table 9 for additional PFAAs 
and α-HBCD and in Table 10 for carbohydrates.  An information  value is considered to be a value that  will be of 
interest  and  use  to  the  SRM  user,  but  insufficient  information  is  available  to  assess  adequately  the  uncertainty 
associated with the value or only a limited number of analyses were performed [1].  Information values cannot be used 
to establish metrological traceability. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 1947 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until  31 December 2026,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  instructions  given  in  this 
ification  is  nullified  if  the  SRM  is  damaged,  contaminated, 
certificate (see “Instructions for Storage and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, 
or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
icate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification.

NOTICE AND WARNING TO USERS 
 
WARNING:  FOR RESEARCH USE; NOT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. 
 
USE
INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE AND USE 
 
Storage:  SRM 1947 is packaged as a frozen tissue homogenate in glass bottles.  The tissue homogenate should not 
be allowed to thaw prior to subsampling for analysis.  This material has been stored at NIST at −80 °C (or lower) since 
it was prepared and should be stored by the user at this temperature for the certified values to be valid within the stated 
uncertainties. 
 
Use:  This material is a frozen tissue homogenate.  After extended storage at temperatures of −25 °C or higher, the 
tissue homogenate will lose its powder-like form.  For the handling of this material during sample preparation, the 
following procedures and precautions are recommended.  If weighing relatively large quantities, remove a portion 
from the bottle and reweigh the bottle to determine the mass of the subsample.  Avoid heavy frost buildup by handling 
the bottles quickly and wiping them prior to weighing.  For weighing, transfer subsamples to a pre-cooled, thick-walled 
glass container rather than a thin-walled plastic container to minimize heat transfer to the sample.  If possible, use a 
cold work space (e.g., an insulated container with dry ice or liquid nitrogen coolant on the bottom and pre-cooled 
implements,  such  as  Teflon-coated  spatulas,  for  transferring  the  powder).    Subsamples  of  this  SRM  for  analysis 
(minimum sample size of 1 g) should be withdrawn from the bottle immediately after opening and used without delay 
for the certified values listed in Tables 1 through 4 to be valid within the stated uncertainties.  The mass fractions of 
constituents  in  SRM 1947  are  reported  on  a  wet-mass  basis.    The  SRM  tissue  homogenate,  as  received,  contains 
approximately 73 % moisture.

PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS( 1) 
 
ollected  in 
Sample Collection:  SRM 1947 was prepared from fillets from adult lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) collected in 
October 1997 at Fisherman’s Island and Big Reef near Charlevoix, MI, in northern Lake Michigan.  The fillets were 
removed from the fish using stainless steel knives and placed in Teflon bags.  The tissue was placed on wet ice and 
transported to NIST where it was stored in liquid nitrogen vapor freezers (−120 °C) until processed and bottled.  A 
total of 79 kg of fillets was obtained.  The frozen fillets were pulverized in batches of approximately 350 g using the 
cryogenic  procedure  described  previously [2].   The  pulverized  fish  tissue  was  then  homogenized  in  an  aluminum 
mixing drum in two batches of approximately 40 kg each [3].  The mixing drum was designed to fit inside a liquid 
nitrogen vapor freezer and to rotate in the freezer thereby mixing the frozen tissue powder.  After  mixing  for 2 h, 
subsamples of approximately 8 g of fish tissue homogenate were aliquoted into pre-cooled glass bottles. 
 
Moisture Content:  The moisture content of the fish tissue homogenate was determined by measuring the mass loss 
from  freeze  drying.    Twelve  bottles  (six  from  each  batch)  of  SRM 1947  were  selected  according  to  a  stratified 
randomization scheme for the drying study.  The entire contents of each glass bottle were transferred to a Teflon bottle 
and dried for seven days at 1 Pa with a −20 °C shelf temperature and a −50 °C condenser temperature.  Based on these 
studies, the mean moisture content of SRM 1947 is 73.00 % ± 0.15 % (mass fraction expressed as percent ± expanded 
uncertainty  with  k = 2,  approximately  95 %  confidence).    The  mass  fraction  values  are  reported  on  a  wet-mass 
(as-received) basis.  If necessary, the results can be converted to a dry-mass basis by dividing by the conversion factor 
of 0.2700 (grams dry mass per gram wet mass).  An uncertainty component for the conversion factor (0.46 %) obtained 
from the moisture measurement should be incorporated in the uncertainties of the values provided on this certificate 
if comparing on a dry-mass basis. 
 
Trace  Elements:    Trace  element  data  are  derived  from  three  sources:    (1) NIST  measurements,  (2) data  from  the 
2001 NIST/NOAA  Interlaboratory  Comparison  Exercise  for  Trace  Elements  in  Marine  Mammals,  and  (3) data 
obtained in 2002 from an interlaboratory comparison exercise conducted by the GMA.  The NIST measurements were 
collected  using  collision  cell  inductively  coupled  plasma  mass  spectrometry (ICPMS)  and  the  method  of  standard 
additions.   A  maximum  likelihood  solution  algorithm  was  used  to  determine  the  consensus  mean  estimates  and 
analytical uncertainties associated with the interlaboratory data, after rejection of outlier laboratories.  This algorithm 
weights data based on inverse variance.  Certified values for As, Cu, Fe, Mn, Rb, Se, and Zn were then assigned by 
combining  the  NIST  values  and  interlaboratory  consensus  mean  estimates  using  an  equal-weighting  scheme.  
Analytical uncertainties were calculated using the bound-on-bias method [4].  The certified value for Hg is derived 
from  isotope  dilution  cold  vapor  inductively  coupled  plasma  mass  spectrometry (IDCV/ICPMS)  measurements 
performed at NIST [5]. 
 
Methylmercury:  The general approach for the assignment of a value for methylmercury was similar to that used in 
marine tissue SRMs [6,7].  The certified value for  methylmercury is based on results of analyses of SRM 1947 at 
NIST  and 
three  NIST  methods  
four  analytical 
used  for  methylmercury  measurements  were  based  on  (1) solid-phase  microextraction (SPME)  with  gas 
chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), (2) SPME with standard additions quantification and GC/inductively 
coupled  plasma  mass  spectrometry (GC/ICPMS) [8],  and  (3) microwave  extraction  with  speciated  isotope  dilution 
and  GC/ICPMS [9].    The  fourth  method  also  utilized  microwave  extraction  with  speciated  isotope  dilution 
GC/ICPMS.    For  the  SPME GC/MS  analyses,  approximately  1 g  subsamples  of  SRM 1947  were  spiked  with  an 
appropriately  diluted  solution  of  IRMM-670 202Hg  enriched  methylmercury 
isotopic  Certified  Reference 
Material (CRM) (Institute of Reference Materials and Measurements [IRMM], Geel, Belgium) followed by an acidic 
microwave digestion using 1 mol/L hydrochloric acid.  Sodium tetraphenylborate was used for phenylation.  After 
headspace  SPME  sampling,  the  SPME  fiber  was  desorbed  using  a  GC  injection  temperature  of  250 °C.    The  GC 
analysis used a 30 m × 0.25 mm column with a 5 % (mole fraction) phenyl methylpolysiloxane phase (0.25 µm film 
thickness)  (DB-5MS,  J&W  Scientific,  Folsom, CA).    For  the  SPME  GC/ICPMS  analyses,  approximately  0.5 g 
subsamples  of  SRM 1947  were  subjected  to  an  acidic  microwave  digestion  using  1 mol/L  hydrochloric acid.  
Sodium tetraphenylborate was used for phenylation.  After headspace SPME sampling, the SPME fiber was desorbed 
using  a  GC  injection  temperature  of  210 °C.    The  GC  analysis  used  a  30 m × 0.28 mm  column  with  a 
100 % dimethylpolysiloxane  phase  (0.50 µm  film  thickness)  (MXT-1,  Restek,  Bellefonte, PA).    For  the  speciated 
isotope  dilution  GC/ICPMS  analyses,  approximately  1.0 g  to  2.0 g subsamples  were  spiked  with  an  appropriately 
diluted sample of IRMM-670 202Hg enriched methylmercury isotopic CRM and subjected to an alkaline microwave 
digestion (using 25 % volume fraction tetraammoniumhydroxide in  water).  Sodium tetraethylborate  was  used  for 
ethylation.  The derivatized methylmercury was back-extracted into isooctane and injected into a GC/ICPMS.  The 
GC  analysis  used  a  30 m × 0.32 mm  column  with  a  100 %  dimethylpolysiloxane  phase  (0.17 µm  film  thickness) 
(HP-1, J&W Scientific).  SRM 1946 Lake Superior Fish Tissue was used as a control in each of the methods described.

Mercury Isotopes: Analytical measurements were made as part of an inter-laboratory comparison with five expert 
Hg  isotope  labs  reporting  a  total  of  nine  methods.    All  measurements  used  cold  vapor multi-collector  inductively 
coupled  plasma  mass  spectrometry  (MC-ICP-MS).    NIST  (Charleston, SC)  achieved  sample  decomposition  using 
microwave  assisted  acid  digestion  in  a  Discover  Open-Focus  Microwave  (CEM,  Matthews,  NC).    NIST’s 
measurements were made using a Nu Plasma II (Nu Instruments, Wrexham, UK), and reported data using two different 
methods  of  instrumental  mass  bias  correction:  thallium  introduced  by  desolvation  nebulizer  (Aridus  II,  CETAC, 
Omaha, NE), or Hg and standard-sample-standard bracketing.  University of Michigan (Ann Arbor, MI) reported data 
using  both  thermal  decomposition  and  microwave-assisted  acid  digestion,  each  coupled  to  an  additional  matrix 
separation step of bubbling, trapping, and purging in KMnO4 and H2SO4.  University of Michigan’s measurements 
were made on a Nu Plasma with instrumental mass bias correction by thallium introduced by Aridus.  Trent University 
(Petersborough,  Canada)  used  a  hotblock/acid  decomposition  method,  Neptune  (Thermo-Finnigan,  Germany)  for 
quantification, and Apex-q desolvation nebulizer (Elemental Scientific, Omaha, NE) for thallium  introduction and 
mass bias correction.  University of Pau/IPREM (Pau, France) decomposed the sample using a high pressure asher 
(Anton Paar) followed by hotblock/acid digestion.  University of Pau/IPREM’s measurements were made on a Nu 
Plasma, and mass bias corrections performed using thallium introduced by DSN-100 (Nu Instruments).  Géosciences 
Environnement  Toulouse (GET)  (Toulouse, France)  reported  data  using  both  a  microwave  assisted  acid  digestion 
(CEM  Discover  microwave)  and  hotplate/acid  digestion.    LMTG’s  measurements  were  made  on  a  Neptune  and 
instrumental mass bias correction performed using Hg and standard-sample-standard bracketing. 
 
Notation and reporting of differences in measured isotope ratios (δ) of stable mercury isotopes in SRM 1947 follow 
the conventions outlined by Blum and Bergquist [10].  All δ values are reported in permil, ‰ (part per thousand, 
equal  to  0.001),  and  are  calculated  relative  to  the  reference  standard  NIST  SRM 3133  Mercury  (Hg)  Standard 
Solution (Lot  No. 061204) using the following equation: 
 

 
e
u

δxxxHg(‰) = [((xxxHg/198Hg)Sample/(xxxHg/198Hg)SRM3133) – 1] * 1000 

xxx is the Hg isotope 199, 200, 201, 202, or 204 
(xxxHg/198Hg)Sample is the ratio of each isotope to 198Hg in SRM 1947. 
(xxxHg/198Hg)SRM3133 is the average ratio of the two NIST SRM 3133 standards bracketing that sample 

 
where 
 
 
 
 
The  measurement  community  typically  calculates  mass-independent  fractionation (MIF)  values  from  these 
δxxxHg values, which are reported using the capital delta notation (Δ).  These values were calculated using the 
he
Blum and Bergquist [10] formulas below and are provided in this report for convenience: 

 
Δ199Hg(‰) = δ199Hg – (δ202Hg * 0.2520) 
Δ200Hg(‰) = δ200Hg – (δ202Hg * 0.5024) 
Δ201Hg(‰) = δ201Hg – (δ202Hg * 0.7520) 
 
The ΔxxxHg notation describes the difference between measured δxxxHg and the theoretically predicted δxxxHg 
using mass dependent fractionation (MDF) laws. 
 
PCBs and Chlorinated Pesticides:  The general approach used for the value assignment of mass fractions for PCBs 
and chlorinated pesticides in SRM 1947 was similar to that reported for the recent certification of SRM 1946 [11] and 
consisted  of  combining  results  from  analyses  at  NIST  using  various  combinations  of  extraction  techniques  and 
solvents, cleanup/isolation procedures, and chromatographic separation and detection techniques.  For SRM 1947 the 
approach consisted of Soxhlet extraction and pressurized fluid extraction (PFE) using dichloromethane (DCM) or a 
hexane/acetone mixture; cleanup/isolation using solid-phase extraction (SPE), size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), 
or normal-phase liquid chromatography (LC); and finally analysis by using gas chromatography with electron capture 
detection (GC-ECD)  or  gas  chromatography  with  mass  spectrometric  detection (GC/MS)  on  three  columns  with 
different selectivity for the separation of PCBs and chlorinated pesticides. 
 
Three  sets  of  results  were  obtained  by  GC-ECD  and  are  designated  as  GC-ECD (I),  GC-ECD (IIA),  and 
GC-ECD (IIB).  For the GC-ECD (I) analyses, between 2 g and 3 g subsamples from each of six bottles of SRM 1947 
were extracted using Soxhlet with DCM.  SEC was used to remove the majority of the lipid material.  The concentrated 
eluant  was  then  fractionated  on  a  semi-preparative  aminopropylsilane  column  to  isolate  two  fractions  containing  
(1) the PCBs and the less polar pesticides and (2) the more polar pesticides.  GC-ECD analyses of the two fractions 
were performed on a 0.25 mm i.d. × 60 m fused silica capillary column with a 5 % phenyl methylpolysiloxane phase 
(0.25 µm film thickness) (DB-5, J&W Scientific).  For GC-ECD (IIA) and GC-ECD (IIB), 3.5 g subsamples from 
each of six bottles were extracted using PFE with DCM.  The SEC and normal-phase LC cleanup steps were the same 
as those used for GC-ECD (I).  GC-ECD (IIA) analyses were performed on a 0.25 mm × 60 m fused silica capillary 
column  with nonpolar proprietary phase (0.25 µm  film thickness) (DB-XLB, J&W Scientific), and GC-ECD (IIB) 

SRM 1947 

Page 4 of 17 

analyses were performed on a 5 % phenyl methylpolysiloxane phase as described above.  For both GC-ECD analyses, 
two PCB congeners that are not significantly present in the fish extract [PCB 30 and PCB 198 for GC-ECD (I) or 
PCB 103 and PCB 198 for GC-ECD (II)], and 4,4'-DDT-d8, 4,4'-DDE-d8, and 4,4'-DDD-d8 were added to the fish 
tissue prior to extraction for use as internal standards for quantification purposes. 
 
Two sets of results were obtained by GC/MS.  The samples used for GC/MS (I) analyses were the same extracts as 
analyzed for GC-ECD (I).  The GC/MS (I) analyses were performed using a DB-XLB column as described above and 
MS  detection.    For  GC/MS (II)  analyses,  two  subsamples  of  between  1 g  and  2 g  were  used  from  three  bottles 
of  SRM 1947.    The  six  samples  were  extracted  using  PFE  with  hexane:acetone  (1:1, volume fraction).    The 
concentrated extract was subjected to cleanup on a silica solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridge with 10 % DCM in 
hexane,  followed  by  a  second  silica  SPE cartridge  that  was  used  for  additional  sample  cleanup.    The  GC/MS (II) 
analyses  were  performed  using  a  50 %  (mole fraction)  phenyl methylpolysiloxane  phase  (0.25 µm film  thickness) 
(DB-17MS, J&W Scientific).  For the GC/MS (II) analyses, PCB 103, PCB 198, and 13C-labeled 4,4'-DDT, lindane, 
PCB 28, PCB 101, PCB 118, PCB 138, PCB 153, and PCB 169 were added to the fish tissue prior to extraction for 
use as internal standards for quantification purposes. 
 
In addition to the analyses performed at NIST, SRM 1947 was used in an interlaboratory comparison exercise in 2002 
as part of the NIST Intercomparison Exercise Program for Organic Contaminants in the Marine Environment [12].  
Results  from  28 laboratories  were  used  as  the  sixth  data  set  in  the  determination  of  the  certified  values  for 
PCB congeners  and  chlorinated  pesticides  in  SRM 1947;  see  Appendix A  for  participating  laboratories7.    The 
laboratories participating in this exercise used the analytical procedures routinely used in their laboratories to measure 
these analytes. 
 
Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers:  Value assignment of mass fractions for PBDE congeners was based on four sets 
of data (three sets  from NIST and one set from a collaborating laboratory)  using a  variety of different extraction, 
cleanup, and quantification methods.  All measurements were performed by using GC/MS operated in either electron 
impact (GC/EI-MS) or negative chemical ionization (GC/NCI-MS) mode. 
 
For two of the NIST data sets, 1 g to 2 g subsamples of tissue from each of five bottles were extracted using PFE with 
DCM.  The concentrated extract was subjected to SEC to remove the majority of the lipids, followed by an additional 
cleanup 
analyzed  by  using  both  
GC/EI-MS  and  GC/NCI-MS  on  a  0.25 mm × 15 m  fused  silica  capillary  column  with  a  5 % (mole fraction) 
13C-labeled 
phenyl methylpolysiloxane  phase 
4,4'-dibromodiphenyl ether (BDE 15) and  13C-labeled 2,2',3,4,5-pentachlorodiphenyl ether (CDE 86)  were added to 
the tissue sample prior to extraction for use as internal standards for quantification purposes. 
 
For the third NIST data set, 3 g to 4 g subsamples of tissue from each of six bottles were extracted using PFE with 
DCM.  The extracts were processed as above using SEC followed by a second cleanup step using a 5 % deactivated 
alumina  SPE  column.    The  extracts  were  analyzed  by  using  GC/EI-MS  on  a  0.25 mm × 60 m  fused  silica  
capillary  column  with  a  5 %  phenyl methylpolysiloxane  phase  (0.25 μm  film  thickness)  (DB-5MS).    13C-labeled 
2,2,4,4',5-pentabromodiphenyl ether (BDE 99) was added to the tissue samples prior to extraction for use as an internal 
standard for quantification of the PBDEs. 
 
For  the  measurements  from  the  collaborating  laboratory  (Indiana University),  four  subsamples  of  8 g  were 
Soxhlet-extracted using hexane:acetone (1:1, volume fraction) after spiking with two internal standards, 13C-labeled 
2,2',3,3',4,4',5,5'-octachlorodiphenyl 
2,3,3',4,4',5-hexachlorodiphenyl 
and 
ether (CDE 194).  Lipids were removed by adding concentrated H2SO4 and shaking; the organic phase was collected 
and  the  extracts  were  further  cleaned  using  a  3 %  deactivated  silica  column  and  an  alumina  column  in  
series.  The extracts were analyzed by using GC/NCI-MS on a 0.25 mm × 60 m fused silica capillary column with a 
5 % phenyl methylpolysiloxane phase (0.25 μm film thickness) (DB-5).  Details of the analyses by the collaborating 
laboratory are presented by Zhu and Hites [13]. 
 
Perfluoroalkyl Acids:  Value assignment of mass fractions for the PFAAs was based on three sets of data (two sets 
from  NIST  and  one  set  from  an  interlaboratory  study)  using  a  variety  of  different  extraction,  cleanup,  and 
quantification methods.  All measurements were performed by using liquid chromatography with triple quadrupole 
mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). 
 
For NIST PFAA method 1, a known amount of internal standard solution (containing selected  13C-labeled PFAAs) 
was added to a fish tissue sample (approximately 0.5 g), vortexed, and 0.5 mL of HPLC grade water was added to the 
sample.  Three mL (volume fraction) of 0.01 mol/L of potassium hydroxide in methanol was added to the samples 
and the samples were then sonicated for 30 min.  The supernatant was removed, evaporated to 1 mL, filtered using a 
Whatman  UniPrep  0.2 µm  filter  (Stanford, ME),  and  poured  into  a  clean  polypropylene  tube.    Ten mL  of  50 % 

(0.25 μm film thickness) 

  For  both  methods, 

silica  SPE  cartridges.

(volume fraction) formic acid in water was added to each extract.  Samples were loaded onto Oasis WAX SPE columns 
(3 mL, 60 mg 30 µm; Waters, Millford, MA).  Compounds of interest were eluted off the columns using methanol 
followed by 1 % (volume fraction) ammonium hydroxide in methanol and samples were analyzed using LC/MS/MS 
with  a  C8 column  (Agilent  Zorbex  Eclipse  Plus  C8,  100 mm × 2.1 mm × 3.5 μm,  Agilent  Technologies,  Santa 
Clara, CA)  and  a  pentafluorophenyl (PFP)  column  (Phenomenex  Kinetex  PFP,  50 mm × 3.0 × mm × 2.6 μm, 
Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) using both a methanol-ammonium acetate in water gradient method and a formic acid in 
acetonitrile-formic acid in water gradient method. 
 
For NIST PFAA method 2, a known amount of internal standard solution (containing 13C-PFAA) was added to a fish 
tissue  sample  (approximately  0.5 g),  vortexed,  and  0.5 mL  of  HPLC-grade  water  was  added  to  the  sample. 
Three milliliters  of  acetonitrile  was  added  to  the  samples  and  the  samples  were  then  sonicated  for  10 min.    The 
supernatant was removed and poured into a clean polypropylene tube.  Samples were solvent exchanged into methanol 
and  then  loaded  onto  Supelclean  ENVI-Carb  SPE columns  (3 mL,  250 g  120–400 mesh  Supelco,  Bellefote,  PA).  
Compounds of interest were eluted off the columns using methanol and samples were analyzed using LC/MS/MS with 
a C8 column (Agilent Zorbex Eclipse Plus C8, 100 mm × 2.1 mm × 3.5 μm, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) 
and  a  PFP  column  (Phenomenex  Kinetex  PFP,  50 mm × 3.0 mm × 2.6 μm,  Phenomenex,  Torrance, CA)  using  a 
methanol-ammonium acetate in water gradient method. 
 
The laboratories participating in the interlaboratory study (see Appendix D) used the analytical methods typically used 
in their laboratories to measure PFAAs. 
 
α-Hexabromocyclododecane:  Three sets of results were combined for the information value of α-HBCD.  In all 
three methods, a known amount of internal standard (13C-labeled α-HBCD) was added to replicates of approximately 
3 g  subsamples.    Samples  were  extracted  with  PFE  using  DCM,  cleanup/isolation  was  accomplished  with  SEC 
followed by SPE.  Extracts were analyzed by LC/MS/MS using negative electrospray ionization with separation on 
either an Agilent Eclipse Plus C18 (3.0 mm × 150 mm × 3.5 mm) analytical column (NIST HBCD methods 1 and 2) 
or a Waters YMC Carotenoid S5 C30 (4.6 mm × 250 mm × 5 mm) column (NIST HBCD method 3). 
 
GMA Interlaboratory Comparison Exercise:  Results for proximates, extractable fat, fatty acids, and selected trace 
elements  were  obtained  from  an  interlaboratory  comparison  exercise  organized  in  2002  by  the  GMA  FIAC;  see 
Appendix B  for  a  list  of participating  laboratories.    The  laboratories  listed  in  Appendix B  were  asked  to  use 
AOAC methods or their equivalent, to make single measurements from each of two bottles, and to report the analytical 
method that was used. 
 
Extractable  Fat  Determination:   The  reference  mass  fraction  value  for  extractable  fat  was  determined  from  the 
combination of results from analyses performed at NIST and the results from the interlaboratory comparison exercise.  
At  NIST,  six samples  were  extracted  with  hexane:acetone  (1;1,  volume fraction)  using  PFE.    The  extracts  were 
evaporatively concentrated to approximately 20 mL (known mass) and an aliquot of 90 µL was placed on an aluminum 
pan.  The extract on the pan was air dried, and the mass of the dried extract determined.  For the interlaboratory study, 
laboratories used their typical extraction methods and then determined the extractable fat by drying the extract and 
determining the mass of the remaining residue. 
 
Proximates:    Results  for  proximates  (solids,  ash,  protein,  and  fat)  were  obtained  from  the  GMA  interlaboratory 
comparison exercise described above.  The value for solids was a combination of the mean of the GMA measurements 
and the NIST moisture determination measurements described above.

(a) Unless otherwise noted, the reference values are the weighted mean of the results provided by the laboratories in Appendix B.  
The uncertainty listed with the value is an expanded uncertainty about the mean with coverage factor, k = 1.97, determined from 
the Student’s t-distribution corresponding to the appropriate associated degrees of freedom and approximately 95 % confidence, and 
calculated to include the combined effect of between-laboratory and within-laboratory components of uncertainty, following the 
ISO/JCGM Guide [14,15].  The measurands are the total mass fractions for ash, protein, and fat on a wet-mass basis listed in Table 6 
as determined by the methods indicted.  Metrological traceability is to the SI derived unit of mass faction (expressed as a percent). 
(b) The  reference  value  for  solids  is  the  unweighted  mean  of  the  mean  of  the  average  of  results  provide  by  laboratories  listed  in 
Appendix B and the mean of the NIST measurements.  The uncertainty listed with the value is an expanded uncertainty about the 
mean,  with  coverage  factor,  k = 1.96,  determined  from  the  Student’s  t-distribution  corresponding  to  the  appropriate  associated 
degrees of freedom and approximately 95 % confidence, and calculated by combining a between-method variance [4] with a pooled, 
within-method  variance  following  the  ISO/JCGM  Guide [14,15].    The  measurands  are  the  total  mass  fractions  for  solids  on  a 
wet-mass basis listed in Table 6 as determined by the methods indicted.  Metrological traceability is to the SI derived unit of mass 
faction (expressed as a percent). 

(c) The value for caloric content is the mean of individual caloric calculations from the laboratories listed in Appendix B.  If the 
proximate  values  above  are  used  for  calculation,  with  caloric  equivalents  of  9,  4,  and  4  for  fat,  protein,  and  carbohydrates, 
respectively,  the  mean  caloric  content  is  165 kcal/100 g.  The  information  mass  fraction  value  for  carbohydrates  is  listed  in 
Table 9.  The measurand is the total mass fraction for calories on a wet-mass basis in Table 6 as determined by the methods 
indicted.  Metrological traceability is to the SI derived unit for energy (expressed as kilocalories per 100 g).

precision, may not include all sources of uncertainty, or may reflect a lack of sufficient statistical agreement among multiple 
analytical methods [1].  These recommended isotopic reference values were determined from a consensus estimate among 
five expert labs reporting nine methods using a weighted means statistical model [22].  The expanded uncertainty for isotopic 
values  were  determined  using  a  Birge  ratio  expansion  model  and  a  coverage  factor  (k)  of  2.571  to  provide  an  expanded 
uncertainty interval that has approximately a 95 % probability of encompassing the consensus mean [22] based on uncertainty
