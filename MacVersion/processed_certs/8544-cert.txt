Report of Investigation 
 
Reference Material 8544 
 
NBS19 Limestone 
 
(Carbon and Oxygen Isotopes in Carbonate) 
 
This  Reference  Material (RM)  defines  the  Vienna  Peedee  Belemnite (VPDB)  scale  for  isotope-number  ratios  of 
carbon (C).  It also defines the VPDB scale for isotope-number ratios of oxygen (O) in carbonates.  The equivalent name 
for this RM, as used by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), is 
NBS19 and is listed in column 1 of Table 1.  This material was also formerly called TS Limestone.  A unit of RM 8544 
consists of one bottle containing approximately 0.4 g of carbonate.

(a) The δ13CVPDB and δ18OVPDB values are exact values that form the basis for the VPDB scales for C and O and 

+1.95 exact 

-2.2 exact 

+28.65 

were set at an international consultants’ meeting at the IAEA in 1984 [1]. 

(b) This value is calculated from data in [2] using the relationship between VPDB and VSMOW on page 36 in [3]. 

 
Reference Difference in Isotope-Number Ratio Values:  The differences in measured isotope-number ratios of 
stable carbon isotopes [N(13C)/N(12C)] are reported as δ13C values, where: 

δ13C = ([Nsample(13C)/Nsample(12C)] – [NVPDB(13C)/NVPDB(12C)])/ [NVPDB(13C)/NVPDB(12C)] 
VPDB refers to the Vienna PDB scale, which is determined by assigning a δ13C value of +1.95 ‰ to this RM [1,4]. 
 
The differences in measured isotope-number ratios of stable oxygen isotopes [N(18O)/N(16O)] in carbonates are reported 
as: 

δ18OVPDB values, where δ18O = ([Nsample(18O)/Nsample(16O)] – [NVPDB(18O)/NVPDB(16O)])/ [NVPDB(18O)/NVPDB(16O)]. 
VPDB refers to the Vienna PDB scale, which is determined by assigning a δ18O value of –2.2 ‰ to this RM [1,4]. 
 
Expiration  of  Value  Assignment:    RM 8544  is  valid,  within  the  measurement  uncertainty  specified,  until 
31 December 2020, provided the RM is handled and stored in accordance with instructions given in this Report of 
Investigation  (see  “Instructions  for  Handling,  Storage,  and  Use”).    The  reference values are nullified if the RM is 
damaged, contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of RM Certification:  NIST will monitor this RM over the period of its validity.  If substantive technical 
changes occur that affect the value assignment before the expiration of this report, NIST will notify the purchaser.  
Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
The technical aspects involved in the issuance of this RM were coordinated through the NIST Analytical Chemistry 
Division by R.D. Vocke, Jr. 
 
Support aspects involved in the issuance of this RM were coordinated through the NIST Measurement Services Division.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
Distribution:  The distribution of RM 8544 (NBS19) is limited to one unit per three-year period of time. 
 
Storage and Stability:  RM 8544 is stable at normal room temperatures.  To minimize the potential for oxygen isotope 
exchange between carbonate and atmospheric water, this RM can be stored in a desiccator.
