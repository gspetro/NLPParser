  fraction, mass concentration, and amount

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended primarily for validation of methods for determining metabolites 
such as fatty acids, electrolytes, vitamins, hormones, and amino acids i n human plasma and similar materials.  This 
SRM can also be used for comparison of measurement technologies used in metabol
omic studies and for quality 
assurance when assigning values to in-house reference materials.  This SRM is intended to represent “normal” human 
plasma.  A unit of SRM 1950 consists of five vials, each containing approximately 1.0 mL of plasma. 
 
The  development of SRM  1950 was a collaboration between the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology (NIST) and the National Institutes of Health  (NIH) National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and 
Kidney Diseases (NIDDK).  Analyses for value assignme nt were performed by NIST and the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention  (CDC), Atlanta,  GA.  All certified and reference values
vitamin D-binding protein, are based on the agreement between the results from NIST methods and from  the CDC, 
where available.   The reference value for  vitamin D-binding protein is based on the agreement between the results 
from a NIST method and University of Washington method.   The associated uncertainties are expressed at the 95  % 
level of confidence  [1–3].  Values are reported in mass
-of-substance 
concentration units as appropriate [4]. 
 
Certified Values:  The certified values of cholesterol and total glycerides, selected fatty acids, amino acids, vitamins 
and carotenoids, clinical  markers and   hormones, and electrolytes in SRM  1950 are provided in Tables  1, 2,  4,  6, 
9, and 10, respectively.  A NIST certified value is a value for which NI ST has the highest confidence in its accuracy 
in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [5]. 
 
Reference Values:   Reference values are provided for fatty acids in Table  3, amino acids in Table  5, vitamins and 
carotenoids in Table  7, trace elements, selenium species, bilirubin, total pr otein,  and  vitamin D-binding protein  in 
Table 11, and perfluorinated compounds in Table 12.  A NIST reference value is a noncertified value that  is the best 
estimate of the true value based on available data; however, the value does not meet the NIST criteria for certification 
and is provided with associated uncertainties that may reflect only measurem ent reproducibility, may not include all 
sources of uncertainty, or may reflect a lack of sufficient statistical agreement among multiple analytical methods [5]. 
 
Information Values:     Information  concentration  values are provided for selected vita mers  in Table  8.  A NIST 
information value is a value that may be of interest to the SRM user, but insufficient information is available to assess 
the uncertainty associated with the value.  Information values cannot be used to establish metrological traceability. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 1950 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until 30 September 2023, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given in this 
certificate (see “Instructions for Storage and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, 
or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes occur that affect the certification before the exp
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Partial funding in support of the development of SRM  1950 Metabolites in  Frozen Human Plasma was provided by 
NIH NIDDK (coordinated by A. Castle) and NIH Office of Dietary Supplements (coordinated by C. Sempos).

SRM 1950 IS INTENDED FO R RESEARCH USE.  THIS IS A HUMAN SOURCE MATERIAL.  HANDLE  THE 
PRODUCT AS A BIOHAZARDOUS MATERIAL CAPABLE OF TRANSMITTING INFECTIOUS DISEASE.  The 
supplier has reported that each donor unit of plasma used in the preparati on of this product was tested by Foo d and 
Drug Administration licensed tests and found to be negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), HIV-1 antigen, 
hepatitis B surface antigen, and hepatitis  C.  However, no known test method can offer complete assurance that 
hepatitis B virus, hepat itis C virus, HIV, or other infectious agents are absent from th is material.  Accordingly, this 
human blood -based product should be handled at the Biosafety Level
POTENTIALLY INFECTIOUS HUMAN SERUM OR BLOOD SPECIMEN in the CDC/NIH Manual [6]. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE AND USE 
 
Storage:  The SRM should be stored at  –60 °C or lower in the original unopened vials.  The  certified values do not 
apply to contents of previously opened vials as the stabilities of the analytes have not been investigated. 
 
Use:  SRM 1950 is provided as frozen plasma that should be allowed to thaw at room temperature for at least 30 min 
under subdued light prior to use.  After the material is thawed, it should be used immediately.  The contents of the vial 
should be gently mixed prior to removal of a test portion for analysis.  Precautions should be taken to avoid exposure 
to strong UV light and direct sunlight. 
 
SOURCE, PREPARATION, AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Source and Preparation:  SRM 1950 is designed to represent “normal” human plasma.  Plasma was obtained from 
100 individuals who had undergone an overnight fast prior to blood draw by Biorec
lamation (Hicksville,  NY).  
Lithium heparin was used as the anticoagulant.  A rapid glucose oxidase test was used to exclude individuals who did 
not adhere to the fasting requirement.  Plasma from an equal  number of men and women in a narrow adult age range 
ected the distribution i n the U.S. population, i.e., 
(40 to 50 years) was used.  Racial distribution of the donors refl
approximately 77  % white, 12  % African American or black, 2  % American Indian or Alaskan Native, 4  % Asian, 
5 % “other,” with approximately 15 % of the total taken from individuals of Hispanic origin.  Plasma was not obtained 
from individuals (1)  who were extreme exercisers (e.g., marathon runners), (2)  with body-mass indices outside the 
95th percentile, or (3) who adhered to extreme dietary regimens.  Individuals should not have taken medication for at 
least 72 h prior to blood draw and were free from overt conditions (e.g., diabetes), diseases, and disorders.   
 
This SRM was developed after an appropriate human subjects research determination by NIST.

Homogeneity Assessment:  The homogeneity of all measurands for which certified and reference values are provided 
was assessed at NIST using the methods and test portion sizes described  below; analysis of variance did not show 
statistically significant heterogeneity.   The reported analytes have been treated as though they are homogeneously 
distributed in the material ; the homogeneity of the other analytes  present in the material and not reported by NIST 
and/or CDC was not assessed. 
 
)  provide  assigned  values.  The
Value Assignment:   Means of data sets from individual methods were combined to provide assigned  values.  The 
measured plasma density is 1.020
 20 g/mL; this uncertainty was 
 86 g/mL with a standard deviation of 0.000
incorporated in values that are reported relative to units of volume. 
 
Analytical Approach for Determination of Cholesterol, Fatty Acids, and Total Glycerides:  The cholesterol mass 
fraction was determined using the NIST isotope dilution  (ID) gas chromatography  (GC) mass spectrometry  (MS) 
(ID-GC-MS) definitive method  [7,8].  This method is an  approved higher-order reference measurement procedure 
according to the Joint Committee  for Traceability in Laboratory Medicine  (JCTLM) [9].  This procedure employs 
hydrolysis of cholesterol esters using potassium hydroxide (KOH) in ethanol, followed by extraction with hexane, and 
derivatization of cholesterol using  bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide. Cholesterol-25,26,27-13C3 was used as the internal 
standard.  Certified values are listed in Table 1. 
 
Value assignment of the mass concentration of total gly cerides (as triolein) was based upon the NIST ID -GC-MS 
definitive method  [10].  This method is recognized as a higher
JCTLM.  The method involves hydrolysis of triglycerides with ethanolic KOH
butylboronic acid in pyridine, and derivatization with 
Tripalmitin-1,2,3-13C3 was used as the internal standard.  Certified values for total glycerides are listed in Table 1. 
 
Determination of Fatty Acids (NIST):  Mass fractions of fatty acids in SRM 1950 were determined using two different 
extraction procedures and two analytical methods (see Table  2 for certified values and Table  3 for reference values).  
An internal standard solution  containing ste aric-d35  acid and myristic -d27  acid was  used.  One set of samples was 
saponified in methanolic KOH and esterified using sulfuric acid in methanol .  A second set was treated with sodium 
methoxide in methanol followed by boron trifluoride  [11].  Both sets of  samples were analyzed by GC with flame 
ionization detection  (FID) and GC -MS.   GC-FID was performed using a 0.25
 mm × 100 m biscyanopropyl 
polysiloxane fused silica capillary column.  GC -MS was performed using a 0.25  mm × 60 m fused silica capillary 
column containing a 50 % cyanopropyl + 50 % phenylpolysiloxane (mole fraction) phase. 
 
Determination of Fatty Acids (CDC ):   Total fatty acid s were determined using ID -GC-MS based on Langerstedt’s 
method [12] (see Table 2 for certified values and Table 3 for reference values).  This procedure employs hydrolysis of 
fatty acids from cholesteryl esters, triglycerides, and phospholipids usi
acetonitrile:hydrochloric acid and methanol:sodium hydroxide in the presence of heat.  Total fatty acids were extracted 
in hexane, concentrated, derivatized using 
.  
Twenty-four fatty acids were quantified using 10  isotopically labeled internal standards.  Fragmentation of fatty 
acid-PFB esters by negative  chemical ionization resulted in a reproducible loss of the  PFB moiety giving a stable 
carboxylate anion on a capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm) with helium as the carrier gas. 
 
Analytical Approach for Determination of Amino Acids:
chromatography (LC) tandem MS  (ID-LC-MS/MS), GC coupled to time -of-flight (TOF) MS  (GC-TOF-MS), with 
two different types of derivatization, and two-dimensional GC×GC-TOF-MS, as described in reference 13.  Certified 
values are listed in Table 4, and reference values are listed in Table 5.  Cysteine thiols have been shown to oxidize in 
plasma forming cystine dimers or to form other disulfide bonds such as thos e of glutathione  [14–16].  No specific 
reducing agents were added to prevent thiol reactions in this study; however, the experimental approach was optimized 
to minimize potential thiol reactions by keeping plasma  samples at or below 4  °C at all times during LC analyses or 
until the derivatization step was reached during GC-MS analyses. 
 
For the LC-MS/MS, GC-MS, and GC×GC-TOF-MS methods, amino acids were enriched from plasma using standard 
methanol precipitation and spiked with isotopically labeled amino acid analogs
.    For LC -MS/MS, analytes were 
separated on a mixed mode (ion
monitoring (MRM) was performed in a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer for two distinct fragmentation transitions 
from each ion.  For GC-TOF-MS and GC×GC-TOF-MS, the methanol layer was evaporated to dryness and derivatized 
with N-(t-butyldimethylsilyl)-N-methyltrifluoroacetamide (MTBSTFA).  The derivatized sample was injected into the 
GC and separated on two columns in series:  a 5 % diphenyl/95 % dimethyl polysiloxane (mole fraction) column and 
a 50  % diphenyl/50  % dimethyl polysiloxane  (mole fraction)  column.  GC×GC -TOF-MS was a two -dimensional 
separation with cryotrapping between the two columns and a modulation period  of 3 s.  GC -TOF-MS analysis was 
performed in one dimension without cryotrapping.

 D Metabolites:

For the second GC-TOF-MS method, plasma was spiked with isotopically labeled amino acid analogs.  Derivatization 
was performed in the plasma matrix with propyl chloroformate (PCF)/propanol.  Derivatized products were extracted 
using chloroform for injection into the GC and separated on two 5
 % diphenyl/95 % dimethyl polysiloxane (mole 
fraction) columns in series, in one dimension without cryotrapping between the columns. 
 
Analytical Approach for Determination of Fat-Soluble Vitamins and Carotenoids:  Value assignment of the mass 
fractions of the vitamins and carotenoids in SRM 1950 was based on the combination of results provided from several 
different analytical methods at NIST and CDC.  NIST provided measurements by using a combination of different LC 
methods with different detection modes as described below.  Certified values are listed in Table 6 and reference values 
are listed in Table 7. 
 
Determination of Vitamins A and E and Carotenoids (NIST):  Retinol and carotenoids were measured at NIST by using 
(1) a polymeric C 18  column [17] with UV/visible 
combinations of two LC  methods with absorbance detection:  
absorbance detection [18,19] and (2) a C18 column with different selectivity and absorbance detec tion of retinol and 
carotenoids and fluorescence detection of tocopherols [19,20].  Proteins in the plasma were precipitated with ethanol 
containing an internal standard.  Analytes were extracted into hexan e, which was evaporated.   The reconstituted 
extracts were then analyzed by LC with absorbance and/or fluorescence detection. 
 
Determination of Vitamins A and E and Carotenoids (CDC):  Fat-soluble micronutrients were measured at CDC using 
reversed-phase LC with photodiode array detection [21].  Plasma was mixed with an ethanol solution containing two 
internal standards, retinyl butyrate and β-apo-8′-carotenal.  Micronutrients were extracted from the aqueous phase into 
hexane and dried under vacuum.  The extract was redissolved in ethanol and acetonit rile and filtered to  remove any 
oad C 18 column 
insoluble material.  An aliquot of the filtrate was injected onto a high carbon l
(150 mm × 4.6 mm × 3 µm particle size) and eluted with a gradient consisting of ethanol and acetonitrile.  Absorbance 
was monitored at 300 nm for vitamin E, 325 nm for vitamin A, and 450 nm for carotenoids. 
 
Analytical Approach for Determination of Vitamin
25-hydroxyvitamin D2, [25(OH)D2],  and 25 -hydroxyvitamin D3, [25(OH)D3],  were measured at NIST using 
ID-LC-MS and ID -LC-MS/MS [22], each with two different types of chromatographic separations.   The certified 
values for 25(OH)D3 are listed in Table 6 and reference values for 25(OH)D2 are listed in Table 7. 
 
Determination of 25(OH)D 3  and 25(OH)D 2  by ID -LC-MS:   Plasma and an internal standard solution containing 
2H6-25(OH)D3 and 2H3-25(OH)D2 were combined in glass tubes, proteins were precipitated, and the metabolites were 
extracted into hexane twice.  The hexane phases were combined and evaporated t o dryness at 40 °C under nitrogen.  
The residues were reconstituted and were further clarified using centrifuge filters.  Extracts were analyzed by LC-MS 
using:  (1) a deactivated C18 stationary phase and (2) a cyanopropyl stationary phase.  Atmospheric pressure chemical 
ionization (APCI) MS detection with positive polarity was used for b
[M – H2O + H]+ ions were monitored for all specie s and were used for quantitation.  The ions monitored included 
m/z 383 for 25(OH)D3, m/z 395 for 25(OH)D2, m/z 389 for 2H6-25(OH)D3 and m/z 398 for 2H3-25(OH)D2. 
 
Determination of 25(OH)D 3 and 25(OH)D2 by ID-LC-MS/MS:   Two grams to 2.5  g of plasma were combined with 
water (to avoid protein precipitation when samples were spiked with internal st
andard  solutions), and an internal 
standard solution containing  2H3-25(OH)D3 and 2H3-25(OH)D2.  After equilibration at room temperature for 1  h, the 
pH of each sample was adjusted to pH  9.8 ± 0.2 with carbonate buffer.  Analytes were extracted from the plasma 
matrix with a mixture of hexane and ethyl acetate.  The combined extracts were dried under nitrogen at 45 °C, and the 
residues were reconstituted with methanol for LC-MS/MS analysis.  APCI in the positive-ion mode and MRM mode 
2H3-25(OH)D3, 
were used.  The transitions at 
m/z 413 → m/z 395 for 25(OH)D2, and m/z 416 → m/z 398 for 2H3-25(OH)D2 were monitored.

Analytical Approach for Determination of Water -Soluble Vitamins:   Water-soluble vitamins were  measured by 
NIST and CDC using combinations of LC methods with fluorescence o
r tandem mass spectrometric detection as 
described below.  Certified values are listed in Tab le 6, reference values are listed in Table  7, and information values 
are listed in Table 8. 
 
Determination of Folic Acid and 5 -Methyltetrahydrofolate (NIST) :   Folic acid and 5 -methyltetrahydrofolate were 
measured in SRM  1950 using a 
13C5-5-methyltetrahydrofolate as internal standar ds [23].  A gradient LC  method with a water/methanol/formic acid 
mobile phase and a pentafluorophenyl column were used for the positive  ion mode LC-MS/MS determination.  For 
folic acid, the transitions at  m/z 442 → m/z 295 (unlabeled) and  m/z 447 → m/z 295 (labeled) were monitored; for 
5-methyltetrahydrofolate, the transitions at  m/z 460 → m/z 313 (unlabeled) and  m/z 465 → m/z 313 (labeled) were 
monitored.

Determination of 5-Methyltetrahydrofolate and Folic Acid (CDC):  The folate vitamers 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and 
folic acid were measured by ID -LC-MS/MS using  13C5-5-methyltetrahydrofolate and  13C5-folic acid as internal 
standards [24,25].  This is a JCTLM -approved method.  Folate species were isolated from plasma by solid
-phase 
extraction (SPE) with phenyl cartridges.  The folate vitamers were separated on a C8 column under isocratic conditions 
with an organic mobile phase containing acetic acid.  The transitions monitored for 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and folic 
acid were the same as those listed above for the NIST determination. 
 
Folate was also measured by a microbiological assay using a 96-well plate microtiter method [26,27].  Diluted serum 
was added to an assay medium inoculated with Lactobacillus casei (NCIB 10463) and containing all of the nutrients 
except folic acid necessary for growth of L. casei.  The microtiter plate was incubated for 42 h at 37 °C.  Because the 
growth of L. casei is proportional to the amount of total folate present in t he serum sample, the folate concentration 
was quantified by measuring the turbidity of the inoculated assay medium at
 590 nm in a micro plate reader.  The 
assay was calibrated with 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. 
 
Determination of Vitamin  B6 (NIST):   Vitamin B6 was determined as pyridoxal  5'-phosphate by ID -LC-MS/MS.  A 
labeled i nternal standard   (pyridoxal-[2H3]-5'-phosphate) was added to the plasma and allowed to equilibrate for 
30 min.  Plasma proteins  were precipitated by the addition of aqueous trichloroacetic acid followed by inc ubation at 
room temperature.  After centrifugation, supernatants were analyzed by L
m/z 248 → m/z 150 (unlabeled) and m/z 251 → m/z 153 (labeled) were monitored. 
 
Determination of Vitamin  B6  (CDC):   The vitamin B 6  vitamers pyridoxal   5'-phosphate and 4 -pyridoxic acid were 
determined by LC with chlorite post-column derivatization and fluorescence detection after protein precipitation with 
metaphosphoric acid and sample filtration  [28,29].   The B6 vitamers were separated under isocratic conditions on a 
C18 column with a mobile phase comprised of aqueous phosphate buffer (with 0.2 % acetonitrile) and methanol.  The 
initial mobile phase was  comprised of 100 % aqueous buffer, and a linear gradient from 0  % to 30 % methanol was 
employed after elution of the B6 vitamers to facilitate column cleanup between injections. 
 
Analytical Approach for Determination of Glucose:   Value assignment of the gl ucose mass fraction (see Table  9) 
was based on a modification of the NIST reference method for glucose, which involves ID-GC-MS and conversion of 
-order reference 
glucose into a dibutylboronate acetate derivative
measurement procedure according to the JCTLM [9].  For certification of SRM 1950 this procedure was modified in 
that the serum was not passed through an ion-exchange resin prior to concentration, freeze-drying, and derivatization. 
 
Analytical Approach for  Determination of Creatinine:
   Creatinine  was determined using an ID -LC-MS 
method [32] that is similar to a method developed at the Laboratory of the Government Chemist [33] and is approved 
by the JCTLM as a higher-order reference measurement procedure (see Table 9). 
 
Analytical Approach for Determination of Urea and Uric Acid:  Urea was determined using a modification of the 
ID-GC-MS method described in reference  34, approved by JCTLM, in which the plasma was spiked with urea -18O, 
passed through a n  SPE cartridge, concentrated, then derivatized to 6
determined using a modification of the ID -GC-MS method described in reference  35, approved by the JCTLM, in 
which plasma samples were spiked with uric acid-15N2, mixed with 0.001 mol/L ammonium hydroxide, passed through 
a strong anion exchange resin, eluted from the column with 1  mol/L acetic acid, freeze -dried, and derivatized with 
MTBSTFA.  Certified values are provided in Table 9. 
 
Analytical Approach for Determination of Homocysteine:    Homocysteine was determined using an ID -GC-MS 
method similar to a method developed at the University of Co lorado Health Sciences Center  [36,37].  Plasma was 
spiked with homocystine-d8, hydrolyzed with dithiothreitol in sodium hydroxide solution to break disulfide bonds and 
release homocysteine and homocysteine
derivatized, and analyzed by GC -MS with selective ion monitoring at  m/z 420 and m/z 424 with confirmation made 
by monitoring  m/z 318 and  m/z 322 [38].  This method is approved by the JCTLM as a higher
-order reference 
measurement procedure.  Certified values are provided in Table 9. 
 
Analytical Approach for Determination of Hormones:   The value assignments for  the cortisol, progesterone, and 
testosterone mass fractions were based upon the LC-MS/MS analytical approaches described below and the certified 
values are provided in Table 9. 
 
Determination of Cortisol:  Value assignment of the cortisol mass fraction  was based on the NIST reference method 
-d3, acidifying the sample, 
(JCTLM-approved) for cortisol  [39], which involves spiking the plasma with cortisol
putting the sample through a n  SPE C 18 cartridge, liquid -liquid extraction, and an alysis by LC -MS/MS using a 
  m/z 363 → m/z 327 and 
C18 column and monitoring two transitions each for the unlabeled forms:
m/z 363 → m/z 121  and labeled forms:  m/z 366 → m/z 330 and m/z 366 → m/z 121.

Determination of Progesterone:  Value assignment of the progesterone mass fraction was based on the NIST reference 
method (JCTLM-approved), for progesterone  [40,41], which involves spiking the plasma with progesterone -13C2, a 
liquid-liquid extraction, and analysis using LC -MS/MS with a C 18 column and  monitoring  the transitions  for  the 
unlabeled form, m/z 315 → m/z 97 and the labeled form, m/z 317 → m/z 99. 
 
Determination of Testosterone:  Value assignment of the testosterone mass fraction was based on  the NIST reference 
method (JCTLM-approved) for testosterone [42], which involves spiking the plasma with testosterone -d3, SPE, and 
analysis using LC -MS/MS with a C
m/z 289 → m/z 97, and the labeled form, m/z 292 → m/z 97. 
 
Analytical Approach for Determination of Elements :  Calcium, copper, magnesium, potassium, selenium, 
sodium  were determined  using a single method  [43].  The certified mass fractions for calcium, magnesium, and 
potassium are based on measurements using 
isotope dilution   collision cell technology  (CCT) inductively coupled 
plasma mass spectrometry, (ID-CCT-ICP-MS) [44–46], which  is a method approved by the  JCTLM.   The certified 
mass fraction for sodium is based on measurements using NIST’s gravime
tric definitive method  [46,47], a 
JCTLM-approved method, without ion exchange.  
measurements using ID -ICP-MS.  The reference mass fraction for copper  is based on measurements using ICP -MS 
with standard additions.  Certified values are listed in Table 10 and reference values are listed in Table 11. 
 
Analytical Approach for Determination of Selenium Species:   The selenium species selenoprotein P, glutathione 
peroxidase, and seleno -albumin were determined by ID -ICP-MS.  Separation of selenoproteins was performed by 
affinity chromatography on heparin-sepharose and blue-sepharose stationary phases that had been packed into PEEK 
columns (4 mm × 50 mm).  Proteins were eluted with 1.5 mol/L ammonium acetate.  Quantitation was based upon ID 
with 77Se.  Reference values are listed in Table 11. 
 
Analytical Approach for Determination of T otal Protein:    Total protein mass concentration (Table
 11) was 
determined using a biuret method  [48].  Spectrophotometric measurements were calibrated using SRM  927d Bovine 
Serum Albumin (7 % Solution). 
 
Analytical Approach for Determination of Bilirubin:  The mass concentration of bilirubin was determined using a 
spectrophotometric reference method developed by Doumas [49] and is provided in Table 11. 
 
Analytical Approach for Determination of Vitamin D -Binding Protein: Vitamin D-binding protein (VDBP) was 
measured by NIST and the University of Washington
Reference values listed in Table 11 are the mean of the mean measurements made at NIST and UW.   
 
Determination of VDBP by NIST:  Seven vials of SRM 1950 were randomly selected and analyzed by ID-LC-MS/MS 
in triplicate on different days.  Samples were prepared gravimetrically using trifluoroethanol to denature the proteins 
as previously described [50].  Following tryptic digestion for 19 hours, peptides containing one Leucine residue with 
13C6 and 15N were added to each sample.  The two transitions w ith the greatest intensity for peptides TSALSAK and  
VLEPTLK were monitored during ID-LC-MS/MS.  The total protein concentration was calculated as the mean of the 
two peptides.  Concentrations were calculated in units milligrams per liter using the mean of the range of molecular 
masses of the common isoforms with or without glycosylation (51 200 g/mol and 51 900 g/mol). 
 
Determination of VDBP by UW:   Seven vials of SRM  1950 were randomly selected and sent to UW for analysis by 
ID-LC-MS/MS.  The digestion procedure used at UW was similar to the one used at  NIST [51].  However, peptides 
ELPEHTVK and VLEPTLK were used during LC-ID-MS/MS.  Also, the labeled peptide standards were added to the 
samples at the beginning of the sample processing and the total digestion time was 30 minutes. 
 
Analytical Approach for Determination of Perfluorinated Compounds (PFCs):  Perfluorinated compounds were 
determined by LC-MS/MS in the negative -ion mode with  13C-labeled PFCs as internal standards.  Reference values 
are provided in Table 12.  In the first method, samples were spiked with the internal  standards and mixed with 50  % 
formic acid i n water (volume fractions).  The PFCs were isolated by SPE with wea
k anion exchange cartridges.  
Chromatographic separation was achieved on either a C8 or a pentafluorophenyl column with gradient elution, and the 
mobile phases were comprised of methanol and 20 mmol/L ammonium acetate.  In the second method, samples were 
spiked with the internal standards and plasma proteins were precipitated with acetonitrile.  After centrifugation and a 
solvent exchange to methanol, PFCs were isolated from the supernatants  by SPE with graphitized carbon cartridges.  
Chromatographic separation was achieved on either a C8 or a pentafluorophenyl column with gradient elution, and the 
mobile phases were comprised of methanol and 20 mmol/L ammonium acetate.

Certified Values for Cholesterol and Total Glycerides:    Each certified value is the mean of NIST measurements 
using higher-order reference methods.  The measurand is the certified value for cholesterol and total glycerides listed 
in Table  1.   The uncertainty provided  with each value is an expanded uncertainty about the mean to cover the 
-method uncertainty and Type  B 
measurand with approximately 95  % confidence; it expresses both the within
components related to the analysis, consistent with the ISO/JCGM Guide [1].  The expanded uncertainty is calculated 
as  U = kuc, where  uc  is intended to represent, at the level of one standard deviation, the effect
s of the combined 
components of uncertainty, and  k  is a coverage factor corresponding to approximately 95  % confidence for  each 
analyte.  For the certified values shown below,  k = 2.   Metrological  traceability is   to the derived SI unit for mass

Certified Values for Fatty Acids:  Certified values for fatty acids are weighted means of the results from analyses at 
NIST using GC-MS and GC-FID and from CDC using GC -MS [50,51] when available.  The value for linoleic acid 
(C18:2 n-6) was based upon the NIST GC-FID and CDC GC-MS results.  The uncertainty provided with each value 
is an expanded uncertainty about the mean  [52,53], with coverage factor  k = 2 (approximately 95  % confidence), 
calculated by combining a pooled within-method variance with a between-method variance following the ISO/JCGM 
Guides [1,2,54].  The measurand is the  certified value for each fatty acid listed  in Table 2.  Metrological traceability

Protein:   Each reference value is the mean of NIST measurements using a single meth
Vitamin D-Binding Protein, which is the mean of means of measurements from NIST and UW.  The measurand is the 
reference value for each trace element, selenium species, total protein, bilirubin, and vitamin D-binding protein listed 
in Table  11 as determined by the indicated methods.   The uncertainty prov ided with each value is an expanded 
uncertainty about the mean to cover the measurand with approximately 95
 % confidence; it expresses both the 
within-method uncertainty and Type B components related to the analysis, consistent with the ISO/JCGM Guide [1].  
The uncertainty for vitamin D-binding protein also incorporates the observed difference between the results from the 
methods [1–3].  The expanded uncertainty is calculated as  U = kuc, where uc is intended to represent, at the level of 
one standard deviation, the effects of the combined components of uncertainty,
corresponding to approximately 95  % confidence for each analyte.
