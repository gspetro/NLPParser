Certificate of Analysis
Standard Reference Material 1990

Single Crystal Diffractometer Alignment Standard - Ruby Sphere

Standard  Reference  Material  (SRM)  1990  is  intended  primarily  for  use  as  an  alignment  standard  for  single  crystal
diffractometry.  One unit consists of three chromium-doped single crystal aluminum oxide (ruby) spheres. The spheres
are nominally 152 µm in diameter with 1.3 µm sphericity.  The spherical geometry was chosen to facilitate alignment and
to avoid corrections for absorption.  These spheres produce reflections at high angles for copper and molybdenum
radiation.  The space group is R3c.

Certified Values and Uncertainties:  The certified lattice parameters of SRM 1990 at 25 °C are:

a:  0.476080 nm ± 0.000029 nm
c:  1.299568 nm ± 0.000087 nm

The certified values were obtained using λ (CuKα1 ) = 0.154059292 (45) nm, and  λ (MoKα1 ) = 0.070931631 (84) nm [1,2].
 The estimated total uncertainty is an expanded uncertainty with a coverage factor, k  = 3.18 (the resulting interval is an
approximate 95 % confidence level), and accounts for (1) uncertainty due to a small variation in chromium content, (2)
random errors of measurement, and (3) the small uncertainty in λ (CuKα1) and λ (MoKα1) [3].  Other systematic effects
such as absorption, extinction, and divergence were not found to be significant and are not included in the uncertainty
estimate.

Expiration of Certification:  The certification of this SRM is valid indefinitely within the measurement uncertainties
specified, provided the SRM is used in accordance with the instructions in this certificate.  However, the certification will
be nullified if the SRM is physically damaged, contaminated, or otherwise altered.  If alteration is suspected, discontinue
use and purchase a new unit.  This SRM is a physical artifact, the physical properties of which are inherently stable under
normal laboratory and usage conditions. 

Reference Value:  SRM 1990 may also be used as a reference for chromium content.  The spheres contain 0.42 % ± 0.01 %
chromium oxide (Cr2O3) expressed as a mole fraction, where the uncertainty represents an expanded uncertainty.  The
chromium content was measured using a microprobe, while specimen-to-specimen variability was measured by scanning
electron microscope energy dispersive spectroscopy.

Technical coordination leading to certification of this SRM was provided by W. Wong-Ng of the NIST Ceramics Division
with significant contributions from T. Siegrist of Lucent Technologies, Murray Hill, NJ.

Statistical consultation was provided by M.S. Levenson of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division. 

Measurements of the chromium content were provided by J.T. Armstrong of the NIST Microanalysis Science Division
and L.P. Cook of the NIST Ceramics Division.

The support aspects concerning the preparation, certification, and issuance of this SRM were coordinated through the
NIST Standard Reference Materials Program by R.J. Gettings and C.R. Beauchamp.

Organization of the round robin project and demonstration of the viability of the ruby spheres were provided by G.T.
 DeTitta of Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute, Buffalo, NY and L. Finger of the Geophysical Laboratory,
Washington, DC.

Preparation and Certification Procedures:  A boule of single crystal ruby, supplied by Arcanum Corporation, Ann
Arbor, MI, was prepared by using the Verneuil technique (flame fusion) then ground into small spheres [4]. Four sets of
spheres were measured, both at NIST and by cooperating laboratories, on three Enraf-Nonius CAD-4 diffractometers and
on a Picker diffractometer using both molybdenum and copper radiation 1.  A total of 39 spheres were measured to obtain
45 data sets.  The diffractometer control program, DIFRAC, developed at the National Research Council of Canada (NRC),
was used for data collection and reduction for all data sets [5].  The CuKα1  and MoKα1 peak positions were determined
by fitting the profiles of high angle peaks.  Lattice parameters were obtained using least squares methods.  Corrections
for thermal expansion [6] and refraction [7] were applied to convert the data to 25  °C for each sample.  The thermal
expansion coefficients used were αa = 5.0 x 10-6 deg-1 and αc = 6.66 x 10-6 deg-1 [6].  These lattice parameters were verified
by a powder diffraction study conducted at the U.S. Geological Survey on 60 crushed spheres using the Guinier-Hägg
transmission technique [8].

Instructions for Use:  Select one of the spheres, clean off adhesive using acetone or alcohol, and mount securely on the
tip of a fiber (or capillary tube) about 0.1 mm in diameter using a minimum amount of adhesive material in the area of
contact between the sphere and the fiber.  Additional spheres are provided in the event of loss.  This SRM is intended
for use at ambient conditions.  With appropriate thermal expansion corrections, the SRM can be used under non-ambient
temperature conditions.

Table 1 lists information values for high-angle 2θ reflections to obtain both the initial sphere orientation and to accurately
align the diffractometer.  The h, k, and l values are the Miller indices, M is the multiplicity, and Fc is the calculated
structure amplitude.  The 2θ values are derived from the certified lattice parameters of the ruby spheres by using the PC
version  (MICRO-POWD)  of  computer  software  POWD10  [9].    The  structure  amplitudes  are  listed  to  serve  as  an
approximate guide of the relative intensity of these reflections.  These reflections, and symmetrically equivalent ones,
should be selected such that the Miller indices h, k, and l are evenly distributed in reciprocal space.  The same reflection
should be measured at some or all of the eight possible diffractometer settings.  It is recommended that the alignment
routine incorporates the algorithm by King and Finger for calculating various alignment corrections [10].
