Carbon Steel  
(AISI 1078) 

SRM 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended primarily for use in the validation of chemical and instrumental 
methods of analysis.  A unit of SRM 1224 consists of one disk, 32 mm diameter and 19 mm thick. 
 
Certified  Mass  Fraction  Values:    Certified  mass  fraction  values  are  provided  in  Table 1 [1].    A  NIST  certified 
value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of 
bias have been investigated or taken into account [2].  A certified value is the present best estimate of the true value 
based on the results of analyses performed at NIST and collaborating laboratories. 
 
Reference Mass Fraction Values:  Reference mass fraction values are provided in Table 2.  Reference values are 
non-certified values that are the present best estimates of the true values; however, the values do not meet the NIST 
criteria for certification and are provided with associated uncertainties that may reflect only measurement precision, 
may not include all sources of uncertainty, or may reflect a lack of sufficient agreement among multiple analytical 
methods [2]. 
 
Expiration  of  Certification:    The  certification  of  SRM 1224  is  valid  indefinitely,  within  the  measurement 
uncertainty  specified,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  given  in  this 
certificate  (see  “Instructions  for  Use”).    Accordingly,  periodic  recalibration  or  recertification  of  this  SRM  is  not 
required.  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance  of  SRM  Certification:    NIST  will  monitor  this  material  over  the  period  of  its  certification.    If 
substantive technical changes occur that affect the certification, NIST  will notify the purchaser.  Registration (see 
attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
Overall  coordination  of  the  technical  measurements  leading  to  certification  was  performed  under  the  direction  of 
R.E. Michaelis  of  the  NIST  Office  of  Reference  Materials  and  J.I. Schultz,  Research  Associate,  ASTM 
International.    Review  and  revision  of  value  assignments  were  performed  by  J.R. Sieber  of  the  NIST  Chemical 
Sciences Division.  
 
Measurements for value assignment of SRM 1224 were performed by B.I. Diamondstone, J.A. Norris and R.K. Bell 
of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division; W.L. Wright, Great Lakes Steel Division of National Steel Corp., Detroit, 
MI;  L. Chalker  and  C.R. Vinyard,  Jones  &  Laughlin  Steel  Corp.,  Cleveland,  OH  and  Youngstown,  OH;  and 
V.M. Chapman, P. Conley, J. Coobatis, F. Cuenot, G. Hanni, N. Pierko, P. Smith, and D. Wolfe, Timken Company, 
Canton, OH. 
 
Statistical analysis for this SRM was provided by D.D. Leber of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division. 
 
Office  of  Reference
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Office  of  Reference 
Materials.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 
 
The  test  surface  is  the  side  that  is  not  labeled  with  the  SRM  number  and  the  diamond-shaped  logo.    The  entire 
thickness of the unit is certified.  Each packaged disk has been prepared by finishing the test surface using a milling 
machine.  The user must determine the correct surface preparation procedure for each analytical technique.  The user 
is cautioned to use care when either resurfacing the disk or performing additional polishing as these processes may 
contaminate the surface.  The material should be stored in its original container in a cool, dry location.  This material 
was tested using both solid disks and chips prepared from disks. 
 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
The  material  for  SRM 1224  was  provided  by  the  Bethlehem  Steel  Corp.,  Bethlehem, PA.    Three  billets  were 
fabricated at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, WA, where the billets were forged into slabs and portions 
of doubtful homogeneity were cut and discarded.  The remaining slab sections were forged and swaged to rods.  The 
rods  were  given  a  sub-critical  anneal  and  were  centerless  ground  to  the  final  size  of  32 mm  diameter.    The 
metallurgical  structure  of  the  specimens  is  that  resulting  from  hot  working  followed  by  annealing.    Extensive 
homogeneity testing was performed at NIST by optical emission spectrometry and by a rapid carbon/sulfur analyzer.  
Only that material exhibiting satisfactory homogeneity was accepted.  Quantitative determinations were performed 
at NIST and at collaborating laboratories using the test methods listed in Table 3. 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values:  The measurand is the total mass fraction for each analyte listed in Table 1 and 
the  certified  value  is  metrologically  traceable  to  the  SI  unit  of  mass.    The  values  are  the  weighted  means  of  the 
individual sets of measurements made by NIST and collaborating laboratories estimated using a Gaussian random 
effects  model [3]  and  the  DerSimonian-Laird  procedure [4,5].    The  associated  measurement  uncertainty  was 
evaluated  by  the  application  of  the  parametric  statistical  bootstrap,  consistent  with  the  JCGM Guide  and  its 
Supplement 1 [6–9].  The expanded uncertainty, U, is calculated as U = kuc, where uc represents, at the level of one 
standard deviation, the combined effects of between-laboratory, within-laboratory, and inhomogeneity components 
of uncertainty.  The coverage factor, k, corresponds to an approximately 95 % confidence level.

Reference Mass Fraction Values:  The measurands in Table 2 are reference mass fraction values obtained by the 
methods indicated in Table 3 and are metrologically traceable to the SI unit of mass.  The values are the weighted 
means  of  the  individual  sets  of  measurements  made  by  NIST  and  collaborating  laboratories  estimated  using  a 
Gaussian  random  effects  model [3]  and  the  DerSimonian-Laird  procedure [4,5].    The  associated  measurement 
uncertainty was evaluated by the application of the parametric statistical bootstrap, consistent with the JCGM Guide 
and its Supplement 1 [6–9].  The expanded uncertainty, U, is calculated as U = kuc, where uc represents, at the level 
of  one  standard  deviation,  the  combined  effects  of  between-laboratory,  within-laboratory,  and  inhomogeneity 
components of uncertainty.  The coverage factor, k, corresponds to an approximately 95 % confidence level.
