This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  intended  for  use  in  calibrating  the  secondary  ion  response  to  minor  and 
trace levels of boron in a silicon matrix by the analytical technique of secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS).  A unit 
of  SRM 2137  consists  of  a  single  crystal  silicon  substrate  with  a  surface  rendered  disordered  by  silicon  ion 
implantation.    The  substrate  is  ion-implanted  with  the  isotope  10B  at  a  nominal  energy  of  50 keV.    SRM 2137  is 
certified for the retained dose of 10B atoms by neutron depth profiling.  The dose is expressed in units of 10B mass per 
unit area.  Noncertified information about the concentration of  10B atoms as a function of depth below the surface is 
provided by SIMS. 
 
Certified Value and Uncertainty:  The total retained dose of 10B atoms was determined by a neutron reaction method 
known  as  neutron  depth  profiling,  using  a  calibrated  reference  film  of  metallic  10B  deposited  on  silicon  as  a 
standard [1]. 
 
 
 
 
 
Using a value of 10.012937 g/mol for the isotopic mass of 10B, the retained dose is equivalent to: 
 
 
 
The stated uncertainty is a 95 % coverage, 95 % confidence tolerance interval that includes random measurement error, 
estimates of material variability, and systematic uncertainties.  The assumption has been made that the actual retained 
dose  may  vary  among  SRM  units  due  to  spatial  variation  in  the  implantation  process.    The  interval  defined  by  the 
certified  value  and  its  associated  uncertainty  covers  the  true  10B  dose  in  at  least  95 %  of  the  SRM  units,  with  95 % 
confidence. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 2137 is valid indefinitely, within the uncertainty specified, 
provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  given  in  this  certificate  (see 
“Instructions for Handling, Storage and Use”).  Accordingly, periodic recalibration or recertification of this SRM is 
not required.  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated or otherwise modified. 
 
The  overall  direction  and  coordination  of  the  technical  measurements  leading  to  certification  were  performed  by 
D.S. Simons of the NIST Surface and Microanalysis Science Division. 
 
Statistical consultation was provided by S.B. Schiller and L.M. Oakley of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division.

Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the NIST Measurement Services 
Division. 
 
Maintenance  of  SRM  Certification:    NIST  will  monitor  this  SRM  over  the  period  of  its  certification.    If 
substantive technical changes occur that affect the certification before the expiration of this certificate, NIST will 
notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
Physical  Description:    The  production  of  the  SRM  involved  several  separate  steps.    The  starting  materials  were 
commercial n-type silicon (100) single crystal wafers of 76-mm diameter, polished on one side.  A grid pattern of 5-mm 
squares was made on the unpolished side of the wafer by a photolithographic method.  Each 5-mm square contains row, 
column, and wafer numbers that provide unique locational identification. 
 
The polished side of the silicon wafer was implanted with 28Si ions in an ion implanter to render the surface sufficiently 
disordered  that  it  would  appear  to  be  amorphous  to  the  10B  ion  beam.    The  28Si  ions  were  implanted  in  3 stages:  
2 × 1015 atoms/cm2 at 360 keV (as Si++); 2 × 1015 atoms/cm2 at 140 keV (as Si+); and 2 × 1015 atoms/cm2 at 50 keV (as 
Si+).  Then 10B was implanted at a nominal energy of 50 keV and a nominal dose of 1 × 1015 atoms/cm2.  The wafers 
were nominally at room temperature during all implantations. 
 
The wafers were cut into 1 × 1 cm squares with a wafer saw.  All squares were located at least 7 mm from the edge of a 
wafer.  The implanted face is the polished, reflective surface. 
 
The ion implantation for this SRM was carried out at the NIST Semiconductor Electronics Division by D.B. Novotny 
and R.G. Russell, and at the Naval Research Laboratory by H.B. Dietrich and F. Moore.  The grid patterning was done 
by  M.L. Miller  and  wafer  dicing  was  done  by  J.E. Luther  and  M.L. Miller  of  the  NIST  Semiconductor  Electronics 
Division.    Neutron  depth  profiling  measurements  were  performed  by  R.G. Downing  and  G.P. Lamaze  of  the  NIST 
Inorganic  Analytical  Research  Division.    Secondary  ion  mass  spectrometry  measurements  were  performed  by 
D.S. Simons  and  P.H. Chi  of  the  NIST  Surface  and  Microanalysis  Science  Division,  and  by  C.W. Magee  and 
S.W. Novak of Evans East, Inc.  Sheet resistance mapping measurements for wafer homogeneity were performed by 
J.R. Ehrstein of the NIST Semiconductor Electronics Division. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE AND USE 
 
Handling:    The  implanted  side  of  the  SRM  is  the  polished,  reflective  side.    This  surface  was  cleaned  prior  to 
packaging. Immediately prior to use, dust particles should be removed from the surface with a pressurized duster. 
 
Etching the sample in HF is NOT recommended, because some boron may be removed with the surface oxide, and also 
because the grid pattern on the back will be removed.  
 
Storage:  When NOT in use the SRM should be stored in its original tray with the cover secured tightly. 
 
Use:    Information  on  material composition as a function of depth can be obtained with SIMS by monitoring one or 
more sputtered ion species as successive layers are removed by ion bombardment.  The concentration value of a species 
is normally calibrated with a reference sample of the same species in the same matrix as the unknown [2,3].  SRM 2137 
is  intended  for  calibrating  the  response  of  a  SIMS  instrument  for  10B  in  a  silicon  matrix  under  a  specific  set  of 
instrumental  conditions.    It  may  also  be  used  by  a  laboratory  as  a  transfer  standard  for  the  calibration  of  working 
standards  of  10B  in  silicon.    The  determination  of  the  response  of  a  SIMS  instrument  for  11B  requires  additional 
knowledge about mass bias effects in SIMS for boron isotopes.  The relative response function of the SIMS instrument 
for 11B with respect to 10B in a silicon matrix can be measured with the aid of a specimen of silicon that contains a bulk 
doping of elemental boron with a natural isotopic composition (80.1 atom percent 11B, 19.9 atom percent 10B). 
 
SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION 
 
The  usefulness  of  this  SRM  for  calibrating  the  SIMS  response  function  of  10B  in  silicon  depends  on  maintaining 
constant analysis conditions during the acquisition of the SIMS profile.  Care must be taken to ensure that the primary 
ion beam current remains stable and the beam raster location remains fixed.

The  energy  of  the  ion  implanter  was  not  calibrated.    Caution  should  therefore  be  exercised  in  comparing  the 
experimental parameters from the SIMS profile with theoretical predictions of implantation models. 
 
The  user  of  this  SRM  should  be  aware  of  a  possible  mass  spectral  interference  between  10B  and  30Si3+  that  may  be 
significant under certain SIMS measurement conditions. 
 
The functional form of the concentration vs depth of 10B in this material was measured by SIMS under conditions that 
+ bombardment at an angle of 52 to the surface normal).  SIMS depth-
minimize ion-induced mixing effects (3 keV O2
profile data from eight profiles from two areas on each of two different wafers are plotted together in Figure 1.  Data 
points within 15 nm of the surface are not indicative of the true surface concentration of 10B due to the presence of a 
native  oxide  on  the  silicon  and  transient  effects  that  occur  following  the  initiation  of  ion  sputtering.    Concentration 
values below 1016 atoms/cm3 of 10B may not be indicative of the true depth distribution of 10B because of background 
signals in the SIMS measurement. 
 
The maximum  10B concentration of 8.37 × 1019 atoms/cm3 occurs at a depth of 0.188 μm.  Interpolated and averaged 
SIMS data from Figure 1, excluding values for depths less than 20 nm from the surface and concentrations below 1016 
atoms/cm3, are provided in Table 1 for reference. 
 
The total 11B content within 0.5 μm of the surface is less than 1013 atoms/cm2, as determined by SIMS.
