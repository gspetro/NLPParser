Certificate 
 
Standard Reference Material® 2035b 
 
Ultraviolet-Visible-Near-Infrared Wavelength/Wavenumber Transmission Standard 

Transmission 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is a certified transfer standard intended for the verification and calibration 
of the wavenumber/wavelength scale of ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) and near infrared (NIR) spectrometers operating 
in transmission mode.  A unit of SRM 2035b consists of an optical filter, 25 mm in diameter and 1.5 mm thick, that 
should be handled in its original optical mount and stored in the wooden container provided. 
 
SRM 2035b  is  a  glass  filter  consisting  of  mole  fractions  of  3.00 %  holmium  oxide (Ho2O3),  1.30 %  samarium 
oxide (Sm2O3),  0.68 %  ytterbium  oxide (Yb2O3),  and  0.47 %  neodymium  oxide (Nd2O3)  in  a  matrix  containing 
lanthanum oxide (La2O3), boron oxide (B2O3), silicon dioxide (SiO2), and zirconium dioxide (ZrO2). 
 
Certification:  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that all 
known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account.  In this certificate, spectral features 
are referred to as bands if their location is determined by the center-of-gravity (COG) or centroid algorithm, whereas 
those determined by a five point cubic polynomial fit are referred to as peak locations.  SRM 2035b is certified for the 
10 % band fraction centroid of seven bands spanning the spectral region from 10 300 cm–1 to 5 100 cm–1 at 8 cm–1 
resolution (vacuum wavenumber).  The same seven bands are certified for the 10 % band fraction centroid location in 
the spectral region from 971 nm to 1960 nm at 1 nm and 3 nm spectral bandwidths (air wavelength).  The certified 
absorption band locations for these seven bands are given in Table 1 for vacuum wavenumber and Table 2 for air 
wavelength.    SRM 2035b  is  certified  for  thirteen  additional  peak  locations  in  the  spectral  region  from  334 nm  to 
805 nm at 1 nm and 3 nm spectral bandwidths.  The certified transmittance peak locations for these thirteen peaks are 
given in Table 3 for air wavelength. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 2035b is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until  01 January 2027, provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and stored  in  accordance with  the  instructions given  in  this 
certificate (see “Instructions for Handling, Storage, and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, 
contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Overall  direction  and  coordination  of  the  technical  measurements  leading  to  the  certification  of  this  SRM  were 
provided by S.J. Choquette of NIST.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
ptical
Handling and Storage:  To maintain the integrity of SRM 2035b, the filter should only be handled in its optical 
mount.  While not in use, the SRM should be stored in the original wooden container provided or one with similar or 
better mechanical protection. 
 
Use:  Carefully insert SRM 2035b into the sample beam of the spectrometer being tested.  Measurements under a dry 
(air or nitrogen) purge are highly recommended for NIR measurements.  If a dry purge is not available, the locations 
of  band 1  and  band 3  may  differ  significantly  from  the  certified  values.    Acquire  the  absorbance/transmittance 
spectrum,  referenced  to  air  at  a  nominal  temperature between  20 ºC  and 25 ºC.    Compare  measured  band or peak 
locations to its certified value listed in the appropriate table (Tables 1, 2 and 3).  Band locations in Table 1 (NIR) are 
vacuum wavenumber values at constant 8 cm–1 resolution.  Investigations have shown that these band locations remain 
4 cm–1, 
resolutions 
within 
2 cm–1, etc.); however, they are not certified for use with resolutions lower than 8 cm–1.  Band locations in Table 2 
(NIR) are air wavelength values at spectral bandwidths of 1 nm and 3 nm.  Peak locations in Table 3 (UV-Vis) are air 
wavelength values at spectral bandwidths of 1 nm and 3 nm.  Comparison should be made to the spectral bandwidth 
more representative of the spectrometer being used.  Taking into account the certification uncertainty of each band of 
SRM 2035b, any statistically significant differences between the measured and certified band locations may be used 
to recalibrate the spectrometer wavenumber/wavelength scale.  For air wavelength measurements, a data point spacing 
equal to or less than 0.5 nm is recommended.  For vacuum wavenumber measurements, a data point spacing equal to 
or less than 1.0 cm–1 is recommended. 
 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Preparation:  The SRM glass composition was melted at Schott Glass (Duryea, PA).  The finished SRM filters were 
supplied to NIST by Avian Technologies (Sunapee, NH). 
 
Measurement Conditions:  Certification of SRM 2035b was accomplished by careful comparative measurements to 
SRM 2035a on several spectrometer systems.  This represents a departure from the certification procedures used in 
prior related SRMs (2035, 2035a and 2065) based on the same nominal glass composition and format.  Certification 
measurements were conducted by analyzing multiple SRM 2035a and SRM 2035b units under identical measurements 
conditions on each instrument.  For NIR vacuum wavenumber band locations, measurements were performed on a 
Bruker Vertex-70 Fourier-transform (FT) spectrometer.  For NIR air wavelength band locations, measurements were 
performed  on  Perkin  Elmer  Lambda 900  and  Cary 6000i  dispersive  spectrometers,  and  the  Bruker  Vertex-70  FT 
spectrometer.  The Bruker Vertex-70 FT was calibrated in air wavelength by applying the appropriate correction for 
the refractive index of air [1] to the calibrated vacuum wavenumber axis.  For UV-Vis air wavelength peak locations, 
measurements were performed on Perkin Elmer Lambda 900 and Cary 6000i spectrometers.  These spectrometers and 
several others were used in the certification of SRM 2035a, which was based on a multi-instrument consensus.  The 
certified values are metrologically traceable to the SI unit of meters (m).  SRM 2035b is traceable to the SI through 
SRM 2035a.  
 
Wavenumber and Wavelength Band/Peak Location Methodology:  The method used to determine the certified 
is  the  center-of-gravity (COG) 
NIR  wavenumber (υ)  and  wavelength (λ)  band 
technique [2-5].    If  another  technique  is  used,  a  comparison  with  the  certified  values  will  not  be  valid.    In  this 
certificate, positions determined with the centroid algorithm are referred to as band locations.  Values listed in Tables 1 
and  2  are  band  locations.    For  SRM 2035b  COG  calculations,  10 %  fractions  of  the  bands  were  used  for  both 
wavenumber and wavelength data.  Further information on the use of this algorithm with other NIST SRMs can be 
found  in  References [6–8].    The  method  used  to  determine  the  certified  UV-Vis  wavelength (λ)  peak  locations  of 
SRM 2035b was a cubic polynomial fit to five points spanning the transmittance peak minimum.  Values listed in 
Table 3 are peak locations. 
 
Certified Values:  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that 
all  known  or  suspected  sources  of  bias  have  been  investigated  or  taken  into  account [9].    The  certified  vacuum 
wavenumber locations for the seven absorption bands spanning the range from 10 300 cm−1 to 5 100 cm−1 are listed 
 
in  Table 1.    These  values  were  obtained  at  8 cm−1
constant  wavenumber  resolution  and  are  certified  for  operation 
between 20 °C and 25 °C.  The certified values represent a bias adjusted band location relative to the certified values 
of  SRM 2035a.    The  NIR  absorbance  spectrum  of  SRM 2035b  in  vacuum  wavenumber  is  shown  in  Figure 1.

(1)Certain  commercial  instruments,  materials,  or  processes  are  identified  in  this  certificate  to  adequately  specify  the 
experimental procedure.  Such identification does not imply recommendation or endorsement by the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology, nor does it imply that the instruments, materials, or processes identified are necessarily the best available for the 
purpose.

Atmospheric water vapor is a significant source of variation for band 3, and this band should be used with caution 
when calibrating commercial spectrometers with SRM 2035b. 
 
The certified values for the NIR air wavelength band locations for the seven absorption bands from 971 nm to 1960 nm 
for 1 nm and 3 nm spectral slit width (SSW) resolutions are listed in Table 2 and are certified for operation between 
20 °C  and  25 °C.    The  certified  values  represent  a  bias  adjusted  band  location  relative  to  the  certified  values  of 
SRM 2035a.  The NIR absorbance spectrum of SRM 2035b in air wavelength is illustrated in Figure 2. 
 
The certified values for the UV-Vis air wavelength peak locations for the thirteen peaks from 334 nm to 805 nm for 
1 nm and 3 nm spectral slit width (SSW) resolutions are listed in Table 3 and are certified for operation between 20 °C 
and 25 °C.  The certified values represent a bias adjusted peak location relative to the certified values of SRM 2035a.  
The UV-Vis transmittance spectrum of SRM 2035b in air wavelength is illustrated in Figure 3. 
 
Certification Uncertainty:  The expanded uncertainties (U95 %) for the wavenumber and wavelength band and peak 
locations given in Tables 1, 2 and 3 are determined from the appropriate combination of instrument-specific standard 
uncertainties to define the interval within which the unknown value of the band/peak can be asserted to lie with a level 
of  confidence  of  approximately  95 % [10–13]  when  measured  between  20 °C  and  25 °C.    Components  of  the 
uncertainty  for  the  wavenumber  and  wavelength  band  and  peak  locations  include:    within-instrument  variation, 
between-instrument bias, calibration of the NIST FT and scanning dispersive spectrometer systems, location shifts 
due to temperature, water vapor interference, and short-term precision variance (i.e., estimated standard deviations).  
For the NIR wavenumber band locations the Type A uncertainty components were determined independently for each 
band  and  the  combined,  band  specific  uncertainties  were  expanded  by  a  coverage  factor  (k = 3).    For  the  NIR 
wavelength band locations the Type A uncertainty components were determined using pooled uncertainties across 
both spectral bandwidths in three band groupings that were selected based on the general correspondence of band 
specific uncertainties.  These band group specific uncertainties were expanded by a coverage factor (k = 3).  For the 
UV-Vis peak locations, a pooled uncertainty across all peaks and spectral bandwidths was estimated and the combined 
overall uncertainty was expanded by a coverage factor (k = 3).  The use of a k = 3 coverage factor in these cases was 
based on the assumption that error distributions for the peak and band location estimates are unimodal and symmetric 
but not necessarily Gaussian [14].
