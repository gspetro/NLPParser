This  SRM  is  in  the  torm  of  fine  chips  and  is  intended  for  use  in  calibrating  instruments  used  in  the  determination  of 
carbon  and  sulfur. 

This  standard  contains  an  appreciable  amount  of  graphitic  carbon  and  should  be  mixed  gently  before  use.

‘The  certified  value  listed  for  a  constituent  is  the  present  best  estimate  of  the 
“true”  value  based  on  the  results  of  the  cooperative  program  for  certification. 

“The  estimated  uncertainty  listed  for  a  constituent  is  based  on  judgment  and 
represents  an  evaluation  of  the  combined  effects  of  method  imprecision, 
possible  systematic  errors  among  methods,  and  material  variability  for 
samples  of  0.5  g  or  more.  (No  attempt  was  made  to  derive  exact  statistical 
measures  of  imprecision  because  several  methods  were  involved  in  the 
determination  of  the  constituents.)

Preliminary  homogeneity  testing  was  performed  at  the  American  Cast  Iron 
on  samples  before  and  foliowing  casting  of  the  material.

Following  chipping  of  the  material,  final  homogeneity  testing  was  performed  at  NBS  for  total  carbon.  Determinations 
were  made  using  0.25  g  samples  on  selected  portions  representing  the  entire  lot. 

Cooperative  analyses  were  performed  in  the  following  laboratories: 

American  Cast  Iron  Pipe  Company,  Birmingham,  Ala.,  R.N.  Smith  and  W.R.  Kennedy. 

Ford  Motor  Company,  Central  Laboratory  Services,  Dearborn,  Michigan,  H.B.  Aaron  and  C.J.  Kelly.
