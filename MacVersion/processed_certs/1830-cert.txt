Soda-Lime Float Glass  
(Nominal Mass Fraction 0.1 % Al2O3) 
 
This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  intended  for  use  in  checking  chemical  methods  of  analysis  and  in 
calibrating  instrumental  methods  of  analysis.    A  unit  of  SRM 1830  consists  of  three  platelets  each  measuring 
38 mm square.  The certified values are listed in Table 1 and represent the present best estimate of the “true value” 
based on the results of the cooperative program for certification.  All values are reported as mass fractions [1]. 
 
The  uncertainties  listed  are  expressed  as  “combined  uncertainties”  calculated  according  to  the  JCGM  and  NIST 
Guides [2].  Each uncertainty is based on the 95 % confidence limit of the “true value”, and is intended to represent 
the combined effect of uncertainty components associated with various analytical factors such as method imprecision, 
possible systematic errors among methods, and material variability.  The measurand is the total mass fraction of each 
constituent listed in Table 1, and the certified value is metrologically traceable to the SI-derived unit for mass fraction, 
expressed as percent.

Methods Used:  The primary procedures used in the analysis of this SRM are those recommended for referee analysis 
in ASTM C 169 Standard Methods for Chemical Analysis of Soda-Lime and Borosilicate Glass.  All methods used in 
the certification of SRM 1830 are cited in Table 1. 
 

(a)ASTM C 169 referee analysis 
(b)Combustion 
(c)Flame Emission 
(d)Spectrophotometry 
(e)Butyl Alcohol, HClO4 

(f)Magnesium Uranyl Acetate 
(g)KMnO4 Titration 
(h)X-ray Fluorescence  
(i)Gravimetric (8-Hydroxyquinoline) 
(j)Gravimetric (Single Precipitation) 

 
 
 

(k)Complexometric 
(l)Gravimetric (Single-Dehydration)  
(m)Atomic Absorption 
(n)Gravimetric (Double Precipitate) 

 
Expiration of Certification: The certification of SRM 1830 is valid indefinitely, within the measurement uncertainty 
specified,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  instructions  given  in  this  certificate  (see 
“Instructions for Use”).  Accordingly, periodic recertification of this SRM is not required.  However, the certification 
is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Technical  and  support  aspects  involved  in  the  original  preparation,  certification,  and  issuance  of  this  SRM  were 
coordinated through the Standard Reference Materials Program by W.P. Reed and R.K. Kirby.

Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Office  of  Reference 
Materials. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical changes occur that affect the certification, NIST will notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet 
or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 
 
CAUTION:  (1) Before using the  SRM in checking chemical analysis, it  must be ground in agate to –200 mesh.  
(2) Before measuring with X-ray fluorescence, at least 30 μm of the surface should be removed by polishing because 
e  surface. 
this glass was made by a float process and may have a thin film of tin on one surface. 
 
Homogeneity(1):  This material was tested for homogeneity at NIST by P.A Pella and R.L. Myklebust of the NIST 
division  formally  known  as  Analytical  Chemistry  Division  using  X-ray  fluorescence  spectrometry.    Three  to  five 
replicate measurements were made on at least 10 elements in each of 15 samples chosen at random from the lot of 
material.  The results did not indicate any significant difference between the samples (for instance, the relative standard 
deviation for calcium was found to be less than 0.1 %) other than that caused by the thin film of tin. 
 
The material for this SRM was prepared and furnished to NIST by Libbey-Owens-Ford Company, Toledo, OH. 
 
Development of this SRM is part of the program of ASTM Subcommittee C14.91 on Standard Reference Materials, 
H.E. Hagy,  Chairman.    The  overall  direction  and  coordination  of  the  cooperative  analyses  leading  to  certification 
originally and in revision to include iron oxide were performed by G.D. Bowling, Chairman of ASTM Subcommittee 
C14.02 on Chemical Properties and Analysis of Glass and Glass Products. 
 
Cooperative analyses for certification were performed in the following laboratories: 
 
Anchor Hocking Corp., Lancaster, OH 
Broadway Glass Co., Inc., Brockway, PA 
Corning Glass Works, Corning, NY 
Emhart Industries, Inc., Windsor, CT 
Ford Motor Co., Lincoln Park, MI 
Libbey-Owens-Ford Co., Toledo, OH  

Monarch Analytical Laboratories, Inc.,Toledo, OH 
Owens-Corning Fiberglass Corp., Granville, OH 
Owens-Illinois, Inc., Toledo, OH and Vineland, NJ 
Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 
Schott Glass Technologies, Inc., Duryea, PA 
Sharp-Schurtz Co., Lancaster, PA 
Thatcher Glass Co., Elmira, NY
