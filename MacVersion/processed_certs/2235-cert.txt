Standard Reference Material 2235 
 
Bismuth for Thermal Analysis 

 
This  Standard  Reference  Material  (SRM)  is  intended  for  use  in  calibrating  differential  scanning  calorimeters, 
differential thermal analyzers, and similar instruments.  A unit of SRM 2235 consists of 1.5 g of high purity bismuth 
in the form of shot with diameters of about 1 mm. 
 
were  measured  in  an 
Certified Values:  The certified value for the enthalpy of fusion and the fusion temperature were measured in an 
adiabatic calorimeter.  Complete details of the measurement method are given in reference 1.

Fusion Temperature 
(K) 

53.146  ±  0.082 

544.556  ±  0.005 

 
 
The  certified  values  were  obtained  from  a  set  of  24  measurements  made  with  an  adiabatic  calorimeter  in  the 
temperature  range  of  514  K  to  576  K.    The  methods  used  for  determination  of  the  certified  values  are  given  in 
reference 2.  The temperature was determined with platinum resistance thermometry; the thermometer was calibrated 
at NIST on the International Temperature Scale of 1990.  The enthalpy of fusion is traceable to NIST calibrations of 
volt,  time,  and  resistance.    The  uncertainties  assigned  to  the  certified  values  of  the  enthalpy  of  fusion  and  the 
temperature of fusion were calculated as described in reference 2.  The uncertainties correspond to an expansion factor 
of 2 (95 % confidence) [3].  
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 2235 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until  01  August  2025,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  given  in  this 
certificate (see “Instructions for Handling, Storage, and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, 
contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
will  notify  the  purchaser. 
changes occur which affect the certification before the expiration of this certificate, NIST will notify the purchaser.  
Registration (see attached sheet or register) will facilitate notification. 
 
Overall  direction  and  coordination  of  the  technical  measurements  leading  to  certification  were  performed  by 
D.G. Archer formerly of the NIST Applied Chemicals and Materials Division. 
 
Support  aspects  involved  with  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Office  of  Reference 
Materials.

ING,  STORAGE,  AND  USE 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
Use:  There are different calibration methods for differential scanning calorimetry and differential thermal analysis.  
This material can be used with those protocols to calibrate the temperature and enthalpy flux scales of a differential 
scanning calorimeter. 
 
Storage  and  Handling:    The  sample  was  packaged  in  10  mL  glass  bottles  and  the  glass  bottles  were  sealed  in 
aluminized bags, both under argon in a glove-box.  Bismuth oxidizes in air; therefore, the sample should be stored 
under an inert gas (e.g. argon or nitrogen) or in a vacuum desiccator.  Bismuth used for a set of measurements for 
calibration should be discarded after several determinations or if the enthalpy or temperature values begin to drift with 
subsequent determinations.
