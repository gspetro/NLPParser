Standard  Reference  Material  2201 

Sodium  Chloride 

(Standard  for  Ion-Selective  Electrodes) 

This  Standard  Reference  Material  (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  use  in  the  calibration  of  ion-selective 
electrodes  for  sodium  and  chloride  ions. 
It  conforms  to  the  American  Chemical  Society  specifications  for 
analytical  reagent-grade  material,  but  should  not  be  considered  entirely  free  from  impurities  such  as  occluded 
water  and  traces  of  bromide  and  heavy  metals.  Coulometric  analysis  of  this  material  indicates  99.9%  purity, 
and  upon  drying  at  450  °C  for  24  h,  99.99%  of  the  calculated  chloride  was  found.  SRM  2201  is  provided  in 
a  unit  of  125  g. 

This  material  is  certified  for  the  activity  coefficients  at  25  °C  of  the  sodium  and  chloride  ions  at  various 
concentrations  and  the  related  values,  pNa  and  pCl.  These  values  are  given  in  the  table  on  the  reverse  page. 
The  accuracies  of  the  pNa  and  pCi  values  are  estimated  to  be  +  0.01.  The  mean  activity  coefficient  may  be 
represented  by  the  equation:

Expiration  of  Certification:  This  certification  is  valid  for  five  years  from  date  of  shipment  from  NIST. 

This  Certificate  of Analysis  has  undergone  editorial  revision  to  reflect program  and  organizational  changes  at  NIST 
and  at  the  Department  of  Commerce.  No  attempt  was  made  to  reevaluate  the  certificate  values  or  any  technical 
data  presented  on  this  certificate. 

The  overall  direction  and  coordination  of  the  technical  measurements  leading  to  certification  were  performed 
under  the  chairmanship  of  R.A.  Durst.

*To  convert  to  parts  per  million  (mg/L)  multiply  by  10°. 

The  mean  activity  coefficient  at  temperatures  from  15  to  45  °C  and  for  any  concentration  up  to  0.1  molal  may 
be  calculated  by  using  the  equation  on  the  face  of  the  certificate  and  these  temperature-dependence 
expressions  for  its  constants,  A,  B,  and  8.  (Constants  C  and  D  are  unimportant  at  0.1  molal  and  below.) 

A  =  0.5108  +  8.4705  x  10%  (t-25)  +  3.5498  x  10%  (t-25)* 
B  =  1.4495  (1.0  +  4.7218  x  10“  (t-25)) 
B  =  0.020442  +  6.21  x  107  (t-25)  -  2.00  x  10°  (t-25) 

The  values  for  pNa  and  pCl  may  be  calculated  from  log  y+  using  the  procedure  described  in  Reference  [1]. 

Preparation  of  Standard  Solutions 

To  prepare  a  1.0  molal  solution,  transfer  57.198  g  of  sodium  chloride  (weight  in  air)  to  a  1-L  volumetric  flask. 
Dissolve  and  fill  to  the  mark  with  distilled  water  at  25  °C.  The  distilled  water  should  have  a  conductivity  no 
greater  than  2  x  10°  siemens/cm.  The  sodium  chloride  should  be  dried  for  2  h  at  110  °C  before  use.  Similarly, 
a  0.1  molal  solution  may  be  prepared  by  the  transfer  of  5.815  g  of  sodium  chloride  (weight  in  air)  to  a  1-L 
volumetric  flask,  dissolving,  and  diluting  to  mark  with  distilled  water  at  25  °C.  Appropriate  dilution  of  either 
standard  solution  should  be  used  to  obtain  standards  in  the  concentration  range  of  interest  to  the  user.

to  liquid  junction  potential  will  be  small.
