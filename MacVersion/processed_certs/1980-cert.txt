Certificate of Analysis 
 
Standard Reference Material® 1980 
 
Positive Electrophoretic Mobility (+µ E) Standard 

 
This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM) is intended  for  use  in  the  evaluation  of  equipment,  and  the  validation  of 
methodology used to measure electrophoretic mobility.  A unit of SRM 1980 consists of a single 60 cm3 polyethylene 
bottle containing 40 cm3 of suspension, which is to be diluted prior to analysis.  The suspension consists of 500 mg/L 
goethite (α-FeOOH)  suspension  saturated  with  100 μmol/g  phosphate  in  a  5 × 10–2 mol/L  sodium  perchlorate 
electrolyte solution at a pH of 2.5.  The goethite powder consists of acicular particles with an average dimension of 
60 nm × 20 nm  as  determined  from  electron  microscopy  and  is  consistent  with  previously  reported  data [1].    The 
characteristics used for the selection of goethite as a standard were its long-term stability, ease of mobility control 
from  positive  to  negative  polarity  by  adjusting  the  phosphate  concentration  or  pH,  reproducibility  of  mobility 
measurements, and the narrow particle size distribution in the suspension [1,2].  Additionally, this material was the 
subject  of  a  previous  interlaboratory  analysis  during  which  goethite  was  suggested  as  a  potential  electrophoresis 
standard [3,4]. 
 
Certified Value:  A  NIST  certified  value  is  a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in 
that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [5].  The certified value was 
computed  using  an  equally  weighted  mean  of  the  injections  for  NIST  and  round  robin  data.    The  uncertainty  is 
calculated according to the ISO/JCGM and NIST Guides [6].  It includes uncertainty due to the measurement process 
and due to material variability, and has an approximate level of confidence of 95 %.  The instruments used by NIST 
and round robin participants, and mean values of their measurements, are shown in Table 2.  The measurand is the 
positive electrophoretic mobility.  Metrological traceability is to the SI unit for meter, volt, and time (expressed as 
µm·cm/V·s). 
 
The certified value and uncertainty for the positive electrophoretic mobility of SRM 1980 is: 
 

2.53 µm·cm/V·s  ±  0.12 µm·cm/V·s 

 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 1980 is valid indefinitely, within the measurement uncertainty 
specified,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  instructions  given  in  this  certificate  (see 
“Instructions for Storage and Use”).  Periodic recertification of this SRM is not required.  The certification is nullified 
if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification.

PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Preparation:  The starting material was synthesized in several batches using the procedure of Atkinson et al. [7] and 
then  washed  with  ultrapure  water  several  times,  freeze  dried  and  stored  in  an  air  tight  polyethylene  bottle.    The 
combined powder obtained from different batches has a BET surface area of 84 m2/g ± 3 m2/g.  Ten grams of powder 
was  suspended  in  20 L  of  5 × 10–2 mol/L  sodium  perchlorate  solution  adjusted  to  pH 2.5.    To  this  well-stirred 
suspension, 100 μmol/g potassium dihydrogen phosphate was added.  The suspension was dispersed by sonication for 
10 minutes  and  then  aged  for  60 days.    From  the  aged  suspension,  40 cm3  aliquots  were  transferred  into 
500 polyethylene bottles using a unidispenser.  Maximum care was taken to avoid inhomogeneity while dispensing 
the samples.   
 
Analysis:  A set of 12 bottles from the 500 bottles was selected at random for homogeneity testing.  In order to prepare 
individual test samples for analysis, two 10 cm3 aliquots were taken by pipette from each bottle and each diluted to 
100 cm3 with deionized water.  Additionally, randomly chosen samples from the group of 500 bottles were sent to 
four  other laboratories  for interlaboratory  data  comparison.   The data  from these  laboratories  were  obtained  using 
three different electrophoretic measuring systems following the procedure specified by NIST.  The certified mobility 
value is based on measurements by the five laboratories.

STORAGE  AND  USE
INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE AND USE 
 
Storage:  SRM 1980 should be stored at room temperature until needed.  After unsealing the container to remove 
material, SRM 1980 should be tightly capped and stored at room temperature between uses.  Otherwise, no special 
handling procedures are required. 
 
Sample Preparation Procedure:  Shake the SRM bottle vigorously for 1 minute with wrist action, then transfer a 
10 cm3 aliquot by pipette to a 100 cm3 volumetric flask and make to volume with deionized water.  Mix the resulting 
suspension (“the sample”) thoroughly and transfer to a polyethylene (non-glass) bottle.  Ultrasonicate for 1 minute at 
40 W.  After cooling to 20 °C to 25 °C, measure the sample pH.  The pH should fall within the range 3.5 ± 0.1; if not, 
adjust the value using 0.1 mol/L nitric acid or 0.1 mol/L sodium hydroxide. 
 
Sample  Analyses  Procedure:    The  following  procedures  should  be  used  for  sample  analysis.    Shake  the  sample 
mildly  with  wrist action  before  each analysis.    Prior to  the first run, precondition  the  electrophoresis  cell  with  the 
sample for 1 minute.  Then introduce a fresh sample for analysis and allow to equilibrate for 10 s to 15 s, and make 
three consecutive mobility measurements.  Take the average (unweighted) of these values. 
 
Warning:  Water used for dilution must be ultrapure (deionized, 18 MΩ resistance); use of tap water may lead to 
contamination of sample; use of distilled water is not certified, but should produce similar results to deionized water 
if no other contamination is present.  Glassware and plasticware should be meticulously clean (wash with copious 
amounts of ultrapure water before using).  Avoid phosphate-containing soaps, sulfuric acid, and hydrochloric acid as 
cleaning agents. 
 
Application Notes 
 

(1)  Temperature dependence:  Application range is 20 °C to 25 °C.  Sample mobility should not vary more than 

0.02 μm∙cm/V∙s per °C over this range. 

(2)  Sample appearance after dilution should be translucent bright yellow with no visible sediment.  If this condition 
is not manifest, the sample may be contaminated and should be discarded.  Repeat dilution procedure.  If poor 
appearance recurs, check “Warning” above before proceeding. 

(3)  After initially unsealing the SRM bottle, the undiluted material should remain viable for up to 7 days if tightly 
capped between uses and stored at room temperature.  Therefore, several diluted samples can be obtained from 
a single bottle over multiple days. 

                                                        

(1) Certain  commercial  equipment,  instruments,  or  materials  are  identified  in  this  certificate  to  adequately  specify  the 
experimental procedure.  Such identification does not imply recommendation or endorsement by the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the purpose.

To compute the overall uncertainty, the responses were modeled as a function of bottle, sample within bottle, and 
measurement error.  The standard uncertainty (uc) due to material is the between-bottle standard deviation, and the 
standard uncertainty due to the measurement process is the standard deviation of the mean response.  These standard 
uncertainties, as well as their associated degrees of freedom, are shown in Table 1.  The combined standard uncertainty 
is the root-sum-of-squares  of  the  material  and  measurements  standard  uncertainties, and  the  coverage  factor is  the 
t-multiplier  for  a  two-sided  95 %  confidence  interval  with  degrees  of  freedom  listed  for  the  combined  standard 
uncertainty.    The  expanded  uncertainty,  U,  is  the  product  of  the  coverage  factor (k)  and  the  combined  standard 
uncertainty (U = kuc). 
 
Note  that  the  SRM  is  certified  for  electrophoretic  mobility  only,  and  not  for  pH  measurement.    The  procedure 
described in the “Instructions for Use” section should be followed to obtain the certified value.
