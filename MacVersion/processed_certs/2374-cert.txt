Standard Reference Material® 2374 
 
DNA Sequence Library for External RNA Controls 

a  template 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended for use as a template for ribonucleic acid (RNA) control synthesis 
using in vitro transcription (IVT).  These RNA controls are designed to be used as external, or “spike-in”, controls to 
uical  performance  of  a 
support confidence in gene expression assays by providing quantitative assessment of the technical performance of a 
gene  expression  measurement.    A  unit  of  the  SRM  contains  96 different  0.5 mL  polypropylene  tubes,  with 
approximately 10 µg, as measured by absorbance (A260), of dehydrated plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in each. 
Each  tube  contains  plasmid  DNA  with  a  unique  template  sequence  for  a  different  external  RNA  control.    These 
controls were developed in cooperation with the External RNA Controls Consortium (ERCC). 
 
These templates can be readily used to make RNA controls (see Figure 1).  Depending on the strand transcribed, the 
controls will mimic either “sense” or “anti-sense” eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA).  When used to make sense 
control RNA, each control will have a nominal 24 nucleotide (nt) polyadenylated (polyA) segment at the 3′ end.  The 
DNA templates and RNA transcripts produced from them are annotated and described in Figures 2 and 3.  The control 
sequences range from 273 nt to 2022 nt, with two population distributions of GC fraction(1), one centered at 35 % GC 
and another at 47 %. 
 
Certified Properties:  The certified properties of SRM 2374 are the DNA sequences of the ERCC control inserts.  
The nucleotide identities are encoded using International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) nucleotide 
symbols, including the ambiguity codes for several bases in the sequences.  Table 2 includes, for each component, a 
reference  to  a  record  containing  the  certified  sequences  in  the  National  Center  for  Biological  Information (NCBI) 
GenBank database.  The certified sequences are available from NIST in a FASTA-formatted data file [1], associated 
with this certificate. 
 
Since the measurand is the value of a nominal property (a sequence of nucleotides), a conventional evaluation and 
expression of measurement uncertainty conforming to the JCGM GUM [2] cannot be used.  Instead, the uncertainty 
associated  with  each  nucleotide  is  expressed  in  an  ordinal  scale  that  represents  the  strength  of  the  belief  in  the 
assigned value  (0 = Most Confident,  1 = Very Confident,  2 = Confident,  3 = Ambiguous).    Characteristics  of 
sequence  data  associated  with  the  levels  of  the  ordinal  scale  are  described in  Table 1  (see  “Certified  Properties 
Confidence Estimates”).  These confidence estimates are available in a companion FASTA-formatted file [1]. 
 
In the absence of a fully developed metrology for identity (the current state of affairs), a pragmatic way forward is to 
consider these DNA sequences as the source of “comparability of identity” for RNA controls transcribed from the 
library. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 2374 is valid, within the specified confidence levels, until 
01 October 2027, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given in this certificate 
(see  “Instructions  for  Handling,  Storage,  and  Use”).    The  certification  is  nullified  if  the  SRM  is  damaged, 
contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Coordination of the technical measurements and analysis leading to the certification was under the direction of M. Salit 
-atory  Office. 
of the NIST Material Measurement Laboratory Office.

Information  Properties:    Table 2  contains  various  useful  characteristics  of  the  template  sequences.    Additional 
companion data files contain supporting data to enable simple, accurate use of the material and primary data when 
performing sequence bioinformatics [1].  The secondary data include a simplified representation of the sequence data 
(with IUPAC ambiguity codes resolved using a best likelihood estimate of the nucleotide); a Gene Transfer File (GTF) 
describing the structures of the RNA controls as if they were genes; a sequence reference file and GTF with the polyA 
tail excluded; and a sequence reference file of the plasmid vector as described in reference 1. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
J. McDaniel  of  the  NIST  Material  Measurement  Laboratory  Office  led  the  certification  and  supporting  study 
measurement processes and oversaw materials preparation and packaging.  M. Roesslein of Empa in Switzerland and 
J. McDaniel  of  NIST  analyzed  the  data  and  established  the  confidence  estimates.    J. Zook,  S. Munro,  P.S. Pine, 
M. Munson,  and  J. Kralj  of  the  NIST  Material  Measurement  Laboratory  Office  and  M. Kline  of  the  NIST 
Biomolecular Measurement Division contributed to the measurements and analysis.  A. Young and R. Blakeslee of 
the National Institute of Health (NIH) Intramural Sequencing Center and K. Becker of the National Institute of Aging 
hosted NIST staff to perform measurements at their laboratories.  The many members of the External RNA Control 
Consortium (ERCC)  from  government,  academic,  and  private  laboratories  contributed  intellectual  content, 
measurements, and analysis to the development of this SRM [3](2). 
 
Statistical consultation for this SRM was provided by A. Possolo and W. Liggett of the NIST Statistical Engineering 
Division. 
 
ordinated  through  the  NIST  Office  of  Reference 
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Office  of  Reference 
Materials. 
 
Certified Properties Confidence Estimates:  A set of heuristic, experience-based, rules (see Table 1) were used to 
establish confidence estimates for the DNA sequence in the ERCC control inserts.  These rules were independently 
applied by two different analysts who hand-curated the replicate two-stranded Sanger sequence data, collated the data 
and then further curated with alternative sequencing platforms.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
Handling:    SRM 2374  is  a  BACTERIAL  SOURCE  MATERIAL  derived  from  a  well-characterized  strain  of 
Escherichia coli (E. coli), not known to consistently cause disease in immunocompetent adult humans, and presents 
minimal  potential  hazard  to  laboratory  personnel  and  the  environment.    Handle  the  components  as  Biosafety 
Level 1 [4].  SRM 2374 components and derived solutions should be disposed of in accordance with local, state, and 
federal regulations. 
 
Storage:  SRM 2374 will arrive on gel freezer packs to maintain sub-ambient conditions.  Upon receipt, SRM 2374 
should be kept in the dark at  –20 °C for long-term storage, or in the dark at 4 °C for short-term storage (if use is 
leir  entirety.
imminent).  Following rehydration, it is recommended that the plasmid DNA components be used in their entirety. 
                                                           

(2) Certain commercial equipment, instrumentation, or materials are identified in this certificate to adequately specify the 
experimental procedure.  Such identification does not imply recommendation or endorsement by NIST, nor does it imply that the 
materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the purpose.

Use:  Figure 1  is  a  flow  chart  of  the  use  process.    Table 2  annotates  the  appropriate  restriction  enzymes  to  use  to 
linearize  each  control.  Figure 2  diagrams  the  five  different  classes  of  restriction  enzyme  pairs  used  for  different 
components of the SRM and the base counts of flanking sequence, which depend on the DNA template used.  Figure 3 
diagrams the IVT process for the various DNA templates.  The process selected will include different configurations 
(and lengths) of flanking sequence, as detailed in Figure 2.  Nominal RNA control transcript lengths can be calculated 
using the “Insert Length” from Table 2, added to the flanking sequence lengths derived from Figures 2 and 3. 
 

•  Rehydration is confirmed by determining the concentration of the DNA prior to use in IVT.  If rehydration 
cannot be confirmed, ensure that the inner walls of the vial have been wetted with rehydration solution and 
repeat  vortex,  centrifuge,  and  concentration  determination.    A  small  number  of  empty  vials  have  been 
observed.    If  presence  of  DNA  cannot  be  confirmed  and  it  is  determined  the  vial  is  empty,  please 
ase
email srminfo@nist.gov to report the issue and receive a replacement. 

 

•  Linearization of the plasmid prior to IVT is the recommended method to ensure that the RNA polymerase 
ceases  transcription  at  the  desired  sequence  location,  yielding  controls  of  proper  length  that  contain  the 
control sequence with minimal excess flanking sequence. 

 
RNA  Pooling:    Individual  RNA  controls  are  typically  pooled  to  assess  assay  technical  performance.    Excellent 
performance of gene expression assays typically covers a dynamic range of ≈ 104 (microarrays) to 106 (RNA-Seq and 
extended-range microarrays).  Assessment of technical performance relies on adding the RNA controls in mixed pools; 
typical pools may be configured to have a 220 (1048576:1) dynamic range between the most- and least-abundant RNA 
species.  This permits assessment of the dynamic range of signal from the measurement system. 
 
Pools  are  often  formulated  to  be  used  in  sets  to  permit  assessment  of  the  “fold-change”  ratio  performance  of  the 
measurement  system.    So-called  “differential  expression”  or  enrichment  of  gene  expression  between  pairs  of 
biological  conditions  is  a  critical  performance  property  that  can  be  assessed  using  these  “ERCC”  controls.    The 
canonical  gene  expression  experiment  evaluates  enrichment  between  a  “case”  and  “control”.    In  these  typical 
applications,  pools  might  practically  be  created  by  mixing  sub-pools  (each  with  its  own  large  dynamic  range  of 
abundance), with the ratios between pools for individual controls established by the mixture fraction of the subpools 
within the pools [5]. 
 
Derivation and Selection:  The sequences for SRM 2374 were derived largely from a library of sequences gathered 
by NIST from members of the ERCC [3].  These sequences included a variety of “anti-genomic” synthetic sequences 
that were designed to have no significant homology with known genomes.  Along with these anti-genomic sequences, 
sequences derived from the organism Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (M. jannaschii) were submitted by Stanford 
University  (Stanford, CA),  and  several  controls  derived  from  Bacillus  subtilis (B. subtilis)  were  submitted  by 
Affymetrix, Inc (Santa Clara, CA).  Contributors of antigenomic sequences included Affymetrix, Inc., Invitrogen, Inc. 
(now part of  Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), and  Atactic, Inc (Houston, TX).  NIST contracted  with DNA 
2.0 (Menlo Park, CA) for the synthesis of 48 sequences from a random antigenomic library developed in consultation 
with R. Setterquist of Life Technologies. 
 
All sequences were submitted to the public domain at the same time as a material transfer of some embodiment of the 
sequence was delivered to NIST.  There are 176 controls in the NIST library in total, of which 96 sequences were 
selected for inclusion in SRM 2374.  Selection was done through a collaborative study with laboratories of the ERCC 
(including participation by J. Warrington and G. Tanimoto of Affymetrix, Inc.; A. Bergstrom-Lucas of Agilent, Inc. 
[Santa Clara, CA]; J. Lozach of Illumina, Inc. [San Diego, CA]; and a core laboratory operated by T. Myers of the 
National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases). 
 
Construction:    The  plasmid  construct  (derived  from  the  pUC18 vector)  was  engineered  to  have  IVT  promoter 
sequences (for T7 and T3 RNA polymerases) and common sequencing primer sites (M13F and M13R) around the 
insert region (which is flanked by restriction enzyme sites).  A 24 base (nominal length) polyT tail at the 5′ end of the 
insert is included so the synthetic RNA controls  mimic eukaryotic  messenger RNA (mRNA)  with a 3′ polyA tail.  
Figure 2  depicts  the  vector  features  of  the  common  plasmid  useful  in  preparing  RNA  controls  and  diagrams  the 
restriction site map.  The basic vector structure was provided free of license for this application by R. Setterquist of 
Life Technologies, Inc. 
 
The ERCC sequence library and vector were provided to Commonwealth Biotechnology Inc. (now AIBioTech, Inc., 
Richmond, VA) for synthesis of RNA that was used in ERCC evaluation and testing.  Commonwealth Biotechnology 
Inc. (CBI) finalized engineering of the vector, cloned the control sequences, and verified the functional cloning with 
Sanger sequencing.  CBI prepared large-scale cultures of  E. coli containing the plasmid DNA constructs and then 
isolated, dispensed and dehydrated the plasmid DNA in the tubes as packaged in the SRM.

Note:  It is to be expected that some small fraction of the DNA in the SRM components may be E. coli genomic DNA.  
This should not affect the synthesis of RNA controls.

Measurement  and  Analysis:    Sanger  sequencing  was  used  to  determine  the  sequence  for  each  component  in 
SRM 2374.  Complete sequencing of both strands of DNA  in the control insert region was performed on replicate 
samples, and the sequence reads were independently hand-curated and evaluated for both sequence and confidence 
estimation  by  two  analysts.    Two  independent  ultra-high  throughput  short-read  sequencing  experiments  were 
performed on two different platforms.  These data were used to resolve confidence estimates for the full data set, and 
were also used to identify eight polymorphic bases in the sequences (described in Table 2 and noted in the reference 
sequence data with IUPAC ambiguity codes). 
 
Homogeneity and Stability:  Evaluation of the SRM material stability and homogeneity was performed by subjecting 
multiple vials of six different controls (spanning a range of GC fraction, length, and source) to an accelerated aging 
process using elevated temperature over a timecourse.  The complete set of materials was fully sequenced to establish 
the stability.  Functional testing was performed using IVT with subsequent evaluation of the RNA.  No effects of 
aging or vial-to-vial differences were observed.

(a) Any uncertainty in the base assignment or note about the specific plasmid is included in a footnote to the plasmid control. 
(b) The insert length includes the polyA tail length. 
(c) The complete RNA transcript length can be calculated using Figures 2 and 3. 
(d) Ambiguity Y at base 153, most likely base call for this position is “C”. 
(e) Ambiguity R at base 599, most likely base call for this position is “A”. 
(f)  Ambiguity Y at base 584, most likely base call for this position is “C”. 
(g) ERCC-00083 contains 2 SacI restriction sites, being within the control sequence.  SacI is the 5' restriction site and will not be an 
issue for preparing the linearized plasmid for sense RNA IVT.  Anti-sense RNA cannot be produced with the transcript using a 
linearized plasmid. 

sluded  in  a  footnote 

(h) At the 3' end of the polyA tail there is a “G”. 
(i)  Ambiguities Y and R respectively at bases 150 and 674, most likely base calls for this positions is “C” and “G”. 
(j)  Ambiguity M at base 29, most likely base call for this position is “A”. 
(k) Ambiguity Y at base 403, most likely base call for this position is “C”.  Ambiguities K, K, and R at bases 994, 995 and 997, 

respectively, as a result of ambiguous primary CE data and lack of coverage for secondary NGS data.   

(l)  Ambiguity Y at base 749, most likely base call for this position is “T”.
