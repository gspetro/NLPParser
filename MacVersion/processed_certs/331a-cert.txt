Copper Ore Mill Tails 

(In cooperation with ASTM International) 

 
rumental 
This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  use  in  evaluating  chemical  and  instrumental 
powder. 
methods of analysis.  A unit of SRM 331a consists of one bottle containing approximately 40 grams of fine powder. 
 
Certified values for eight elements in SRM 331a are listed in Table 1.  Reference values for 16 elements are listed in 
Table 2.  Information values for eight elements are listed in Table 3.  For all elements, values are reported as mass 
fractions [1].  Value assignment categories are based on the definition of terms and modes used at NIST for chemical 
reference materials [2].   
 
Certified Values:  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy, in 
that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or accounted for by NIST.  A certified value is the 
present  best  estimate  of  the  true  value  based  on  the  results  of  analyses  performed  at  NIST  and  collaborating 
laboratories using the test methods listed in Table 4.  The uncertainty listed with each value is an expanded uncertainty 
based on a 95 % confidence interval [3] and is calculated according to the method in the JCGM and NIST Guides [4]. 
 
Reference Value:  Reference values are non-certified values that are the present best estimates of the true values.  
However, the values do not meet the NIST criteria for certification and are provided with associated uncertainties that 
may not include all sources of uncertainty.  The uncertainty listed with each value is an expanded uncertainty based 
on a 95 % confidence interval [3] and is calculated according to the method in the JCGM and NIST Guides [4]. 
 
Information Values:  An information value is considered to be a value that will be of interest to the SRM user, but 
insufficient information is available to assess the uncertainty associated with the value.  Information values cannot be 
used to establish metrological traceability. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 331a is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until  01 October 2027,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  given  in  this  certificate 
(see “Instructions  for  Use”).    The  certification  is  nullified  if  the  SRM  is  damaged,  contaminated,  or  otherwise 
modified. 
 
Maintenance  of  Certification:    NIST  will  monitor  this  SRM  over  the  period  of  its  certification.    If  substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Coordination of the technical measurements for certification of this SRM was under the direction of J.R. Sieber of the 
NIST Chemical Sciences Division.  
 
Analytical measurements for certification of this SRM were performed by A.F. Marlow, J.R. Sieber, and L.J. Wood 
of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division.  
 
Statistical consultation for this SRM was provided by S.D. Leigh of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 
 
To relate analytical determinations to the assigned values on this Certificate of Analysis, a minimum sample quantity 
of  100 mg  is  recommended  on  the  basis  of  homogeneity  testing  performed  at  NIST  using  X-ray  fluorescence 
spectrometry.  The powder does not require preparation prior to weighing.  The material should be stored in its original 
»  be 
container,  tightly  capped,  in  a  cool,  dry  location.    Loss  on  drying  was  tested  at  110 °C  for  2 h  and  found  to  be 
approximately 0.7 %.

(a) The assigned value is an unweighted mean from two to six sets of results from two to three analytical methods performed at as 
many as five laboratories.  The uncertainty listed with the value is an expanded uncertainty about the mean, with coverage factor 
k calculated by combining a between-method variance with a pooled, within-method variance following the JCGM and NIST 
Guides [4,5].  The measurand is the total mass fraction for each element listed above.  Metrological traceability is to the SI unit 
for mass. 

(b) The assigned value is a weighted mean from seven or eight sets of results from two to three analytical methods performed at as 
many as five laboratories.  The uncertainty listed with each value is an expanded uncertainty about the mean, with a coverage 
factor  k  calculated  by  combining  a  between-source  variance  incorporating  inter-method  bias  with  a  pooled  within-source 
1-source 
variance following the JCGM and NIST Guides [4,6]. 

(c) The assigned value is based on analyses by a single primary method at NIST [2].  The expanded uncertainty is calculated as a 
95 % confidence interval where U = kuc.  The quantity uc is intended to represent, at the level of one standard deviation, the 
tion,  the 
combined  standard  uncertainty  calculated  according  to  the  JCGM  and  NIST  Guides [4].    The  coverage  factor,  k = 2.26, 
corresponds to a t factor obtained from the t-distribution for approximately 9.5 degrees of freedom.
