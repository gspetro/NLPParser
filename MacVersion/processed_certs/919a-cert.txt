Certificate of Analysis 
 
Standard Reference Material 919a 
 
Sodium Chloride 

(Clinical Standard) 

 
This  Standard  Reference  Material  (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  the  production  of  saline  solutions  of  accurately  known 
concentrations as well as in the calibration of instrumentation and standardization of procedures used in the determination of 
sodium and chloride ions in clinical analyses.  A unit of SRM 919a consists of approximately 30 g of sodium chloride. 
 

Certified Purity:  99.89 %  ±  0.03 % (mass fraction)

Chloride was determined on 12 dried samples by a modified method of Marinenko and Taylor [1] and indicated a purity of 
99.89 %  mass  fraction,  based  on  stoichiometric  sodium  chloride  (NaCl).    Stoichiometry  of  the  SRM  was  corroborated  by 
gravimetric assay of the sodium as sodium sulfate following ion exchange separation of the sodium.  The gravimetric assays 
and analyses for specific impurities indicate that the only impurity present at a level above 100 μg/g is occluded water. 
 
The certified purity, listed above, is based on drying a sample for 3 h at 110 °C.  The uncertainty is the half-width of a 95 % 
confidence  interval  for  the  certified  purity  of  this  material.    Dried  samples  should  be  stored  over  anhydrous  magnesium 
perchlorate before use.  Two samples ignited at 650 °C for 2 h and assayed coulometrically indicated a purity of 100.01 % 
mass  fraction.    This  increase  results  from  the  elimination  of  occluded  moisture,  which  is  not  quantitatively  eliminated  by 
drying or ignition at lower temperatures. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  This certification will be valid for five years from the date of shipment. 
 
NOTICE AND WARNING TO USERS 
 
cle  under  normal  laboratory  conditions. 
Storage:  SRM 919a should be stored in the tightly closed original bottle under normal laboratory conditions. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 
 
At room temperature, sodium chloride is hygroscopic above 60 % relative humidity.  The absorbed  water can be removed, 
however,  by  drying  for  3  h  at  110 °C  and  storing  over  freshly  exposed  phosphorus  pentoxide  (P2O5)  or  magnesium 
perchlorate (Mg(ClO4)2).  It is recommended that weighing and other manipulations not be made when the relative humidity 
exceeds 60 percent.

The  technical  and  support  aspects  concerning  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  though  the  NIST  Standard 
Reference Materials Program by B.S. MacDonald of the NIST Measurement Services Division. 
 
This  material  was  examined  for  compliance  with  the  specifications  for  reagent  grade  sodium  chloride  as  given  in  Reagent 
iety,  Washington,  DC.  The  material  meets  or  exceeds 
Chemicals, 7th ed., (1987) published by the American Chemical Society, Washington, DC.  The material meets or exceeds 
the minimum requirements in every respect. 
 
A  semiquantitative  survey  for  trace  elements  by  flame  atomic  emission  spectrometry  indicated  the  presence  of  potassium 
9 μg/g, and calcium 6 μg/g. 
 
The estimated uncertainty for each of these mass fractions is 20 %.  This survey also indicated less than 20 μg/g cesium (Cs), 
less  than  0.03  μg/g  lithium  (Li),  and  less  than  0.5  μg/g  rubidium  (Rb).    Magnesium  (Mg)  was  determined  to  be  less  than 
0.05 μg/g by flame atomic absorption spectrometry.  In addition, barium (Ba) was determined to be less than 5 μg/g by direct 
current (DC) arc, atomic emission spectroscopy. 
 
Preparation  of  Standard  Solution:  A  standard  solution  of  100.0  mmol  of  NaC1  per  liter  may  be  prepared  by  weighing 
5.851  g  of  SRM  919a  (dried  at  110 °C  for  3  h,  into  a  one-liter  volumetric  flask  and  adding  3  mL  of  concentrated  nitric 
acid (HNO3) (ACS reagent grade or equivalent) and 100 mL of deionized water.  After the NaCl is dissolved, dilute to the 
mark with deionized water.  The concentration required for the analytical procedure may be prepared by accurate dilution of 
the standard solution with deionized water.  Solutions of SRM 919a are stable indefinitely when stored in a well-stoppered, 
all-glass container.  All such solutions should be clear and display no turbidity.
