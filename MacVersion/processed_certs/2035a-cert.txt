Standard Reference Material® 2035a 

 
Ultraviolet-Visible-Near-Infrared Wavelength/Wavenumber Transmission Standard 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is a certified transfer standard intended for the verification and calibration 
of  the  wavenumber/wavelength  scale  of  ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis)  and  near  infrared (NIR)  spectrometers 
operating in transmission mode.  A unit of SRM 2035a consists of an optical filter, 25 mm in diameter and 1.5 mm 
thick, that should be handled in its original optical mount and stored in the wooden container provided. 
 
SRM 2035a  is  a  glass  filter  consisting  of  mole  fractions  of  3.00 %  holmium  oxide (Ho2O3),  1.30 %  samarium 
oxide (Sm2O3),  0.68 %  ytterbium  oxide (Yb2O3),  and  0.47 %  neodymium  oxide (Nd2O3)  in  a  matrix  containing 
lanthanum oxide (La2O3), boron oxide (B2O3), silicon dioxide (SiO2), and zirconium dioxide (ZrO2). 
 
Certification:  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that 
all  known  or  suspected  sources  of  bias  have  been  investigated  or  taken  into  account.    In  this  certificate,  spectral 
features are referred to as bands if their location is determined by the center-of-gravity (COG) or centroid algorithm, 
whereas  those  determined  by  a  five  point  cubic  polynomial  fit  are  referred  to  as  peak  locations.    SRM 2035a  is 
certified  for  the  10 %  band  fraction  centroid  of  seven  bands  spanning  the  spectral  region  from  10 300 cm–1 to 
5 100 cm–1 at  8 cm–1  resolution  (vacuum  wavenumber).    The  same  seven  bands  are  certified  for  the  10 %  band 
fraction centroid location in the spectral region from 971 nm to 1960 nm at 1 nm and 3 nm spectral bandwidths (air 
wavelength).    The  certified  absorption  band  locations  for  these  seven  bands  are  given  in  Table 1  for  vacuum 
wavenumber and Table 2 for air  wavelength.  SRM 2035a is certified  for thirteen additional peak locations in  the 
spectral  region  from  334 nm  to  805 nm  at  1 nm  and  3 nm  spectral  bandwidths.    The  certified  transmittance  peak 
locations for these thirteen peaks are given in Table 3 for air wavelength. 
 
Expiration  of  Certification:    The  certification  of  SRM 2035a  is  valid,  within  the  measurement  uncertainties 
specified, until 01 January 2022, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given 
in this certificate (see  “Instructions  for Handling, Storage,  and Use”).  The certification  is nullified if the SRM  is 
damaged, contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance  of  SRM  Certification:    NIST  will  monitor  this  SRM  over  the  period  of  its  certification.    If 
substantive  technical changes occur that affect the certification before the  expiration of this certificate, NIST  will 
notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
The overall direction and coordination of the technical measurements leading to the certification of this SRM were 
provided by S.J. Choquette of the NIST Biosystems and Biomaterials Division. 
 
The  production  and  certification  of  SRM 2035a  was  conducted  by  S.J. Choquette  and  A.A. Urbas  of  the  NIST 
Biosystems and Biomaterials Division.  Additional measurements were supplied by  L. Hanssen and C. Cooksey of 
the NIST Sensor Science Division. 
 
Statistical consultation was provided by S.D. Leigh and H.-K. Liu of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division. 
 
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Office  of  Reference 
Materials.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
Handling and  Storage:  To maintain the integrity of SRM 2035a, the filter should only be  handled in its optical 
mount.  While not in use, the SRM should be stored in the original wooden container provided or one with similar or 
better mechanical protection. 
 
Use:  Carefully insert SRM 2035a into the sample beam of the spectrometer being tested.  Measurements under a 
dry  (air  or  nitrogen)  purge  are  highly  recommended  for  NIR  measurements.    If  a  dry  purge  is  not  available,  the 
the 
locations  of  band 1  and  band 3  may  differ  significantly 
absorbance/transmittance spectrum, referenced to air at a nominal temperature between 20 ºC and 26 ºC.  Compare 
measured  band  or  peak  locations  to  its  certified  value  listed  in  the  appropriate  table  (Tables 1,  2  and  3).    Band 
locations in Table 1 (NIR) are vacuum wavenumber values at constant 8 cm–1 resolution.  Investigations have shown 
that  these  band  locations  remain  within  the  stated  uncertainties  for  resolutions  higher  than  8 cm–1  (e.g.,  4 cm–1, 
2 cm–1, etc.); however, they are not certified for use with resolutions lower than 8 cm–1.  Band locations in Table 2 
(NIR) are air wavelength values at spectral bandwidths of 1 nm and 3 nm.  Peak locations in Table 3 (UV-Vis) are 
air  wavelength  values  at  spectral  bandwidths  of  1 nm  and  3 nm.    Comparison  should  be  made  to  the  spectral 
bandwidth more representative of the spectrometer being used.  Taking into account the certification uncertainty of 
each band of SRM 2035a, any statistically significant differences between the measured and certified band locations 
may  be  used  to  recalibrate  the  spectrometer  wavenumber/wavelength  scale.    For  air  wavelength  measurements,  a 
data  point spacing  equal to or less than 0.5 nm  is recommended.  For vacuum  wavenumber measurements, a data 
spacing equal to or less than 1.0 cm–1 is recommended. 
 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Preparation:  The SRM glass composition was melted at Schott Glass, Duryea, PA.  The finished SRM filters were 
supplied to NIST by Avian Technologies, Sunapee, NH. 
 
Measurement  Conditions:    Certification  measurements  for  NIR  vacuum  wavenumber  band  locations  were 
performed on Bruker Vertex-70, Bruker IFS-66, Bruker IFS-66v, and Bomem DA3 FT spectrometers.  The Bruker 
Vertex-70,  Bruker  IFS-66,  and  Bruker  IFS-66v  FT  spectrometers  were  calibrated  in  vacuum  wavenumber  units 
using an acetylene gas cell or ambient water vapor bands.  The Bomem DA3 FT spectrometer was calibrated using 
ambient water vapor and carbon dioxide bands.  Certification measurements for NIR air wavelength band locations 
were performed on PerkinElmer Lambda 900, PerkinElmer Lambda 1050, Cary 6000i dispersive spectrometers, and 
a Bruker Vertex-70 FT spectrometer.  The air wavelength axis of the PerkinElmer Lambda 900 was calibrated using 
emission lines of Kr, Ar, and Ne atomic emission pen lamps in first and second grating order.  The air wavelength 
axis of the PerkinElmer Lambda 1050 was calibrated per the instrument instructions using the emission lines of the 
internal  D2 source  in  the  second  grating  order.    The  air  wavelength  axis  of  the  Cary 6000i  was  calibrated  using 
emission  lines  of  Hg  and  Ar  from  an  internal  atomic  emission  calibration  lamp.    The  Bruker  Vertex-70  FT  was 
calibrated in air wavelength by applying the appropriate correction for the refractive index of air [1] to the calibrated 
vacuum wavenumber axis.  Certification measurements for UV-Vis air wavelength were performed on PerkinElmer 
Lambda 900  and  Cary 6000i  commercial  dispersive  spectrometers,  the  NIST  Materials  Measurement  Laboratory 
High  Accuracy  Spectrophotometer (HASII),  and  an  additional  in-house  constructed  spectrometer  system.    The  air 
wavelength  axes  of  all  spectrometers  were  calibrated  using  lines  from  atomic  emission  calibration  lamps.    The 
PerkinElmer  Lambda 900  and  HASII  were  calibrated  using  Hg  and  Kr  emission  lines.    The  Cary 6000i  was 
calibrated using Hg and Ar emission lines.  The in-house constructed spectrometer was calibrated using Hg, Ar and 
Kr emission lines. 
 
Wavenumber and Wavelength Band/Peak Location Methodology:  The method used to determine the certified 
NIR  wavenumber (υ)  and  wavelength (λ)  band  locations  of  SRM 2035a  is  the  center-of-gravity (COG)  technique 
[2–5].    If  another  technique  is  used,  a  comparison  with  the  certified  values  will  not  be  valid.    In  this  certificate, 
positions determined with the centroid algorithm are referred to as  band locations.  Values listed in Tables 1 and 2 
are band locations.  For SRM 2035a COG calculations, 10 % fractions of the bands were used for both wavenumber 
and  wavelength  data.    Further  information  on  the  use  of  this  algorithm  with  other  NIST  SRMs  can  be  found  in 
References [6–8].  The method used to determine the certified UV-Vis wavelength (λ) peak locations of SRM 2035a 
was a cubic polynomial fit to five points spanning the  transmittance  peak  minimum.  Values listed in Table 3 are 
peak locations. 
 

                                                           

(1)Certain  commercial  instruments,  materials,  or  processes  are  identified  in  this  certificate  to  adequately  specify  the 
experimental  procedure.    Such  identification  does  not  imply  recommendation  or  endorsement  by  the  National  Institute  of 
Standards  and  Technology,  nor  does  it  imply  that  the  instruments,  materials,  or  processes  identified  are  necessarily  the  best 
available for the purpose.

Certified Values:  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in 
that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [9].  The certified vacuum 
wavenumber locations for the seven absorption bands spanning the range from 10 300 cm−1 to 5 100 cm−1 are listed 
 
in  Table 1.    These  values  were  obtained  at  8 cm−1
constant  wavenumber  resolution  and  are  certified  for  operation 
between 20 °C and 26 °C.  The certified values represent the consensus mean band locations from measurements on 
four  Fourier-transform (FT)  spectrometer  systems.    The  NIR  absorbance  spectrum  of  SRM 2035a  in  vacuum 
wavenumber is shown in Figure 1.  Atmospheric water vapor is a significant source of variation for band 3, and this 
band should be used with caution when calibrating commercial spectrometers with SRM 2035a. 
 
The  certified  values  for  the  NIR  air  wavelength  band  locations  for  the  seven  absorption  bands  from  971 nm  to 
1960 nm for 1 nm and 3 nm spectral slit width (SSW) resolutions are listed in Table 2 and are certified for operation 
between  20 °C  and  26 °C.    The  certified  values  of  the  air  wavelength  band  locations  represent  the  mean  band 
locations  from  three  scanning  dispersive  spectrometer  systems  and  one  FT  spectrometer  system.    The  NIR 
absorbance spectrum of SRM 2035a in air wavelength is illustrated in Figure 2. 
 
The certified values for the UV-Vis air wavelength peak locations for the thirteen peaks from 334 nm to 805 nm for 
1 nm  and  3 nm  spectral  slit  width (SSW)  resolutions  are  listed  in  Table 3  and  are  certified  for  operation  between 
20 °C and 26 °C.  The certified values of the air wavelength peak locations represent the mean band locations from 
four  scanning  dispersive  spectrometer  systems.    The  UV-Vis  transmittance  spectrum  of  SRM 2035a  in  air 
wavelength is illustrated in Figure 3. 
 
Certification Uncertainty:  The expanded uncertainties (U95 %) for the wavenumber and wavelength band and peak 
locations  given  in  Tables 1,  2  and  3  are  determined  from  the  appropriate  combination  of  instrument-specific 
standard uncertainties to define the interval within which the unknown value of the band/peak can be asserted to lie 
with a level of confidence of approximately 95 % [10–13].  Components of the uncertainty for the wavenumber and 
wavelength  band and peak locations include:    within-instrument variation,  between-instrument bias, calibration of 
the  NIST  FT  and  scanning  dispersive  spectrometer  systems,  location  shifts  due  to  temperature,  water  vapor 
interference, and short-term precision variance (i.e., estimated standard deviations).  For the NIR wavenumber and 
wavelength band locations, the Type A uncertainty components were determined independently for each band and 
the  combined,  band  specific  uncertainties  were  expanded  by  a  coverage  factor  (k = 3.184)  based  on  the  Student’s 
t-distribution and number of spectrometers contributing to the certification.  For the UV-Vis peak locations, a pooled 
uncertainty  across  all  peaks  was  estimated  for  the  Type A  component  and  the  combined  overall  uncertainty  was 
expanded by a coverage factor (k = 2).
