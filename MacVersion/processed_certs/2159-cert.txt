Standard  Reference  Material  2159 

Low-Alloy  Steel 

(In  Cooperation  with  the  American  Society  for  Testing  and  Materials) 

This  Standard  Reference  Material  (SRM)  is  in  the  form  of  pins  that  are  4  mm  in  diameter,  12  mm  long  and  weigh 
approximately  1g  each.  SRM  2159  is  primarily  intended  for  use  in  calibrating  instruments  used  in  the  determina- 
tions  of  carbon  and  sulfur  in  steel.

"The  certified  value  listed  for  a  constituent  is  the  present  best  estimate  of  the  “true”  value  based  on  the  results  of  the  cooperative  program  for 
certification. 

“The  estimated  uncertainty  listed  for  a  constituent  is  based  on  judgment  and  represents  an  evaluation  of  the  combined  effects  of  method  im- 
precision,  possible  systematic  errors  among  procedures,  and  material  variability.  No  attempt  is  made  to  derive  exact  statistical  measures  of  im- 
precision  because  several  procedures  were  used  in  the  determination  of  both  constituents. 

The  overall  coordination  of  the  technical  measurements  leading  to  certification  was  performed  under  the  direction 
of  J.I.  Shultz,  Research  Associate,  ASTM-NIST  Research  Associate  Program. 

The  technical  and  support  aspects  involved  in  the  preparation,  certification,  and  issuance  of  this  Standard 
Reference  Material  were  coordinated  through  the  Standard  Reference  Materials  Program  by  W.P.  Reed  and  P.A. 
Lundberg. 

PLANNING,  PREPARATION,  TESTING,  ANALYSIS: 

The  material  for  this  standard  was  prepared  under  a  NIST  contract  with  T.  R.  Linde. 

Homogeneity  testing  was  performed  by  J.D.  Messman  of  the  NIST,  Inorganic  Analytical  Research  Division, 
Gaithersburg,  MD,  and  by  J.H.  Morris  and  E.  Yates  of  Lukens  Steel  Co.,  Coatesville,  PA. 

Cooperative  analyses  for  certification  were  performed  in  the  following  laboratories: 

-  American  Cast  Iron  Pipe  Co.,  Birmingham,  AL.,  R.N.  Smith  and  R.  Huffman. 
-  Lukens  Steel  Co,  Coatesville,  PA  J.H.  Morris  and  E.  Yates. 
-  National  Institute  of  Standards  &  Technology,  Inorganic  Analytical  Research  Division,  Gaithersburg,  MD,  J.D.
