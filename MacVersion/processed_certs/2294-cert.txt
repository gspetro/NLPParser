Certificate of Analysis 
Standard Reference Material 2294 

 

 
Reformulated Gasoline (11 % MTBE) 

 
This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  use  in  the  calibration  of  instruments  and  the 
evaluation  of  methods  used  for  the  determination  of  total  sulfur,  benzene,  toluene,  and  methyl  tert-butyl 
ether (MTBE)  in  reformulated  gasoline  or  similar  matrices.    A  unit  of  SRM 2294  consists  of  a  set  of  two  20 mL 
ampoules containing a synthetic gasoline blend of 25 organic compounds. 
 
Certified  Mass  Fraction  Values:    Certified  mass  fraction  values  and  associated  95 %  confidence  intervals  are 
given in Table 1.  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that 
all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [1]. 
 
Reference  Mass  Fraction  Values:    Reference  mass  fraction  values  and  associated  95 %  confidence  intervals  are 
given in Table 2.  A NIST reference value is a noncertified value that is an estimate of the true value.  However, the 
value does not meet the NIST criteria for certification and is provided with an associated uncertainty that may reflect 
only measurement precision, may not include all sources of uncertainty, or may reflect a lack of sufficient statistical 
agreement among multiple analytical methods [1]. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 2294 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until 31 December 2022 provided that the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given in 
this  certificate  (see  “Instructions  for  Storage  and  Use”).    However,  the  certification  is  nullified  if  the  SRM  is 
damaged, contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance  of  SRM  Certification:    NIST  will  monitor  this  SRM  over  the  period  of  its  certification.    If 
substantive  technical  changes  occur  that affect  the  certification before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST will 
notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification.  
 
The  overall  direction  and  coordination  of  technical  measurements  leading  to  certification  were  performed  by 
G.W. Kramer and F.R. Guenther of the NIST Analytical Chemistry Division. 
 
Analytical measurements leading to the certification of this SRM were performed by S.N. Chesler, S.J. Choquette, 
F.R. Guenther,  T.L. Green,  W.R. Kelly,  J.L. Mann,  S.A. Margolis,  L.C. Sander,  and  R.D. Vocke, Jr.  of  the  NIST 
Analytical  Chemistry  Division.    Data  analysis  was  performed  by  D.L. Duewer  of  the  NIST  Analytical  Chemistry 
Division. 
 
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Measurement  Services 
Division.

NOTICE AND WARNING TO USERS 
 
Consult the Material Safety Data Sheet for details on safe handling before use.  Ensure local exhaust or adequate 
ventilation in storage and laboratory facilities meet published gasoline exposure limits.  Prevent contact with heat, 
sparks, or open flame.  Those handling gasoline should wear appropriate clothing and gloves to prevent skin contact 
with this material and appropriate safety goggles to prevent eye contact.   
 
Protect ampoules from physical damage.  The unscored, thick-walled ampoules of this SRM must be opened with 
care and attention.  Score the ampoule completely around the neck with a sharp triangular file or other scoring tool.  
Wrap the body of the ampoule in a thick cotton towel or use leather gloves while snapping the neck from the body 
of the ampoule. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE AND USE 
 
Storage:  Sealed ampoules, as received, should be stored in the dark at temperatures between 10 °C to 30 °C away 
from  incompatible  materials.    (See  “Notice  and  Warning  to  Users”)    Ampoules  should  be  opened  as  described 
above.   
 
Use:    Aliquots  for  analysis  (minimum  sample  size  of  1 g)  should  be  withdrawn  at  20 °C  to  25 °C  and  used 
immediately  after  opening  the  ampoules.   Samples  must  be  processed without delay  for  the  certified  values  to  be 
valid within the stated confidence intervals. 
 
SOURCE AND PREPARATION 
 
All  chemicals  used  in  the  preparation  of  this  material  were  obtained  from  commercial  sources.    The  synthetic 
gasoline  base  was  prepared  from  21 reagent-grade  saturate,  olefinic,  and  aromatic  stock  materials.    A  typical  gas 
chromatogram of the reformulated gasoline base is shown in Figure 1.  Three  reagent-grade  thionate  stock  materials 
were  mixed  with  HPLC-grade  MTBE.    Known  masses  of  synthetic  gasoline  base,  thionate/MTBE  mixture,  and 
MTBE  were  combined,  mixed,  and  chilled  in  a  pressurized  vessel.    The  solution  was dispensed  into  20 mL  glass 
ampoules; the ampoules were cooled to to30 °C and flame sealed. 
 
Homogeneity Assessment:  The homogeneity of SRM 2294 was assessed at NIST at a 1 g sample size. 
 
Value Assignment:  The mass fraction of sulfur is based on isotope-dilution thermal ionization mass spectrometry 
(ID-TIMS)  [2].    The  mass  fraction  of  benzene  and  the  mass  fraction  of  ethanol  are  based  upon  split-injection, 
flame-ionization detection gas chromatographic (GC-FID) analysis and gravimetry.  The mass fraction of toluene is 
based upon reversed-phase liquid chromatography, GC-FID analysis, and gravimetry.  The reference value of water is 
based on coulometric Karl Fischer titration.  The major aromatic and olefinic constituents of the synthetic base gasoline 
were  determined  using  GC-FID  after  a  rigorous  evaluation  of  the  purity  of  the  constituent  stock  materials  by  gas 
chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS).  The reference values of the organic components of this SRM have been 
calculated from results of the GC-FID measurements of the base gasoline composition combined with the known masses 
of the various components of the mixture.  The aromatic, olefinic, and saturate composite reference values are the sum of 
all constituents identified as belonging to each of these groupings.  
 
The  reference  value  of  total  organic  oxygen  composite  is  the  sum  of  the  oxygen  mass  fraction  of  all  identified 
organic oxygenates.  The 95 % confidence interval for each certified and reference value has been assigned on the 
basis of analytical judgment [3,4].  It incorporates estimates of analytical precision, known biases among methods of 
differing  analytical  reliability,  reliability  estimates  for  the  mass-spectrometric  identification  of  impurities,  and 
allowance  for  apparent  heterogeneity  among  the  ampoules.    The  certified  mass  fraction  of  each  component  is 
expected to lie within the specified interval with a 95 % level of confidence.

injector  temperature  200 °C;  split  ratio  200:1;  initial  temperature  35 °C,  hold  10 min,  programming  rate 
4 °C per min to 200 °C, final hold 10 min; detector temperature 280 °C.  Except for m-xylene and p-xylene, 
the  components  unresolved  by  the  conditions  used  to  obtain  the  chromatogram  in  Figure 1  may  be 
separated using the following: 30 m (6 %  cyanopropyl) methylpolysiloxane column; injector temperature 
200 °C; split ratio 200:1 initial temperature 30 °C, initial hold 5 min, programming rate 25 °C per min to
