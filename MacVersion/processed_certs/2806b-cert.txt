Medium Test Dust (MTD) in Hydraulic Fluid 

Fluid  Power 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended for use in the calibration of instrumental response to medium 
test  dust  suspended  in  hydraulic  fluid.    A  unit  of  SRM 2806b  consists  of  two  bottles  containing  polydisperse, 
irregularly shaped mineral dust suspended in approximately 400 mL of hydraulic fluid each.  
 
Certified Values:  Certification of this SRM is in terms of the projected area particle diameters of the collected dust 
particles from the  hydraulic fluid.  The diameters are made traceable to the NIST Line  Scale Interferometer (LSI) 
through  a  NIST  calibration  of  a  Geller  MRS-4XY  pitch  standard.  The  certified  diameters  are  correlated  with  the 
numeric  concentration  of  particles  greater  than  each  diameter,  referred  to  as  cumulative  number  particle  size 
distribution.  The mean cumulative particle concentrations versus certified diameter values from 1 µm to 30 µm are 
given  in  Table 1  and  plotted  in  Figure 1.    A  NIST  certified  value  is  a  value  for  which  NIST  has  the  highest 
confidence in its accuracy, all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [1].   
 
Information  Values:    Values  given  in  Table 2  are  provided  for  information  only  and  are  not  certified.    An 
information value is considered to be a value that  may be  of use to the SRM  user, but insufficient information is 
available  to  assess  the  uncertainty  associated  with  the  value  or  only  a  limited  number  of  analyses  were 
performed [1].  Information Values cannot be used to establish metrological traceability. 
 
SRM 2806b  can  be  used  in  conjunction  with  the  International  Organization  for  Standardization (ISO)  method 
ISO 11171:2010, “Hydraulic Fluid Power - Calibration of Liquid Automatic Particle Counters” [2]. 
 
Expiration  of  Certification:    The  certification  of  SRM 2806b  is  valid,  within  the  measurement  uncertainty 
ad  stored  in  accordance  with  instructions  given 
specified, until 31 December 2020, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with instructions given 
in this certificate (see  “Instructions  for Handling, Storage,  and Use”).  The certification  is nullified if the SRM is 
damaged, contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance  of  SRM  Certification:    NIST  will  monitor  this  SRM  over  the  period  of  its  certification.    If 
substantive  technical changes occur that affect the certification before the expiration of this certificate, NIST  will 
notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification.  
 
The coordination of the technical measurements culminating in certification of SRM 2806b was led by R.A. Fletcher 
of the NIST Materials Measurement Science Division. 
 
Design  and  scanning  electron  microscopy (SEM)  imaging  was  performed  by  N.W.M.  Ritchie.    D.S. Bright 
developed  the  image  processing  software  and  provided  the  image  analysis.    R.A. Fletcher  provided  homogeneity 
testing,  sample  selection,  preparation  and  data  analysis.    The  aforementioned  staff  members  are  from  the  NIST 
Materials Measurement Science Division. 
 
Statistical  consultation  including  experimental  design  and  uncertainty  determination  was  provided  by  J.J.  Filliben 
and W.F. Guthrie of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division. 
 
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Office  of  Reference 
Materials.

SRM 2806b 

rocedures  described  in  ISO 

Source and Preparation(1) 
 
The  medium  test  dust,  SAE  5-80  Micrometer  Test  Dust  (Medium  Test  Dust) [3]  lot  number 4390C,  used  for  the 
preparation of SRM 2806b was donated by Powder Technology Inc. (Burnsville, MN).   Suspension of the dust in 
MIL-PRF-5606  hydraulic  fluid  was  performed  by  Institut  de  la  Filtration  et  des  Techniques  Separatives (IFTS) 
(Agen, France). 
 
HANDLING 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
*  the 
SRM 2806b  should  be  mixed  and  sampled  according  to  procedures  described  in  ISO 11171:2010.    Only  if  the 
sampled  volume  is  decanted  immediately  after  the  prescribed  mixing  does  the  quantity  of  the  SRM  left  in  the 
original bottle remain certified (see  “Sampling  for  Liquid  Automatic Particle  Counter”  section).  The  SRM  bottle 
should be kept upright and never heated above 80 °C and the bottle should be opened and sampled in a dust-free 
environment so as to avoid contamination. 
 
Sampling for Liquid Automatic Particle Counter 
atic  Particle  Counter 
 
Immediately before use, mix SRM 2806b in accordance with instructions in ISO 11171:2010.  Briefly, the mixing 
process is as follows.  Shake a closed bottle of SRM 2806b by hand or laboratory shaker for approximately 1 min.  
Disperse contents of bottle using an ultrasonic bath with minimum intensity of 5 W/cm2 for 1 min.  Mechanically 
shake  for  a  minimum  of  3  min  on  a  commercial  paint  or  laboratory  shaker.    Then  ultrasonically  treat  briefly  or 
evacuate  to  remove  air  bubbles  from  the  suspension  and  introduce  immediately  into  the  liquid  automatic  particle 
counter.  According to ISO 11171:2010 the minimum sample should be at least 10 mL and have 10 000 particles at 
the  lowest  threshold  setting  which  should  be  obtained  in  each  of  at  least  5  consecutive  particle  counts.    Larger 
volumes are permissible.  CAUTION:  If the suspension is not used immediately after shaking and evacuation, large 
particles will settle to the bottom of the bottle and be omitted from the particle population measured. 
 
NIST Certification Method(2) 
 
The bottle-to-bottle homogeneity was determined using an HIAC ROYCO HR-LD 600 laser light extinction particle 
counter.  The NIST measurements were compared to on-line and bottle-to-bottle measurements made by IFTS at the 
time of manufacturing.  Material inhomogeneity was negligible with respect to the measurement uncertainty.  The 
particle size and numbers measured for certifying this material were determined from digital images of dust particles 
extracted from aliquots of 8 bottles of the hydraulic fluid by filtration forming a set of 12 filters.  These images were 
collected using a TESCAN MIRA3 Automated Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) operating in 
the  backscatter  and  secondary  electron  modes.    Particle  area  on  the  backscatter  images  was  determined  by  image 
analysis  that  sums  the  pixels  in  a  gray-level  threshold (binary)  domain  that  defines  the  particle [4].    The  particle 
diameter is expressed as the projected area diameter of a stably oriented disc shaped particle (diameter of a circular 
particle with area equal to that of a particle in stable orientation). 
 
Four SEM magnifications were used to obtain particle size data from particles ranging in size from 1 µm to 50 µm.  
A  Geller  MRS  4XY  SEM  Magnification  Pitch  Standard  traceable  to  the  NIST  Line  scale  Interferometer [5]  was 
used to determine the conversion of pixel dimension to metric values.  More than 29 070 000 particles were sized 
from approximately 20 400 SEM image fields.   
 
The  measurand  is  the  projected  area  particle  diameter  in  micrometers.    The  certified  values  are  metrological 
an  cumulative  number  particle 
traceable to the SI unit of length through the NIST Line Scale Interferometer.  The mean cumulative number particle 
concentration (particles/mL) in the hydraulic fluid is related to the projected area particle diameter values.

(1) Certain  commercial  equipment,  instruments  or  materials  are  identified  in  this  certificate  to  adequately  specify  the 
experimental  procedure.    Such  identification  does  not  imply  recommendation  or  endorsement  by  the  National  Institute  of 
Standards  and  Technology,  nor  does  it  imply  that  the  instruments,  materials,  or  processes  identified  are  necessarily  the  best 
available for the purpose. 

(2) The  particle  size  was  determined  for  the  dust particles  in  their  most  mechanically  stable  orientation [6]  and  thus  the 
particle area approaches, on average, the largest possible value.  Literature values for the ratio of mean projected diameters for 
random and for stable oriented quartz particles (common to ISO Medium Test Dust) is approximately 0.8.

NIST  Certified  Uncertainties:    The  expanded  uncertainties  listed  in  Table 1  were  calculated  according  to  the 
JCGM GUM Supplement 1 [7].  These uncertainties correspond to the expanded uncertainties in particle projected 
area diameters and define a confidence interval of approximately 95 %.  The combined and expanded uncertainties 
were  derived  using  Monte  Carlo  simulation  with  inputs  from  the  digitization  and  sampling  reproducibility 
uncertainties.    
 
The  Type A  and  Type B  standard  uncertainty  components  arise  from  measurement  uncertainties  in  the  following 
sources:  (1) particle sampling and counting, (2) fluid volume sampled, (3) SEM magnification and (4) digital image 
representation/processing.    The  uncertainty  associated  with  volume  is  for  the  most  part  a  Type A  uncertainty  and 
included in sampling results.  The part that is not random is the uncertainty in the hydraulic fluid density which was 
determined to be approximately 8x10-5 g/mL and is too insignificant  to impact the analysis.  Similarly, the length 
and  area  uncertainty  is  associated  with  the  uncertainty  in  the  Geller  Standard  (0.002 µm  and  0.0028 µm, 
respectively) and has little contribution to the total uncertainty in the measurements.  The area uncertainty impacts 
the filter area which is only relevant to the sampling at high magnification since at low magnification the entire filter 
area was included.
