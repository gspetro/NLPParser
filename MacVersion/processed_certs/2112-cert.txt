Certificate 
Standard Reference Material® 2112 

 
Dynamic Impact Force Verification Specimens  
 
(Self-Verification, 8-mm Striker; 24 kN nominal) 
 
Lot No.:  HH-103 
 

This  Standard Reference Material  (SRM) is intended primarily for the verification of the maximum forc
e measured 
dynamically using a Charpy machine equipped with an instrumented 8-mm striker, in accordance with the current ASTM 
Standard E2298 [1] or  the current  ISO Standard 14556 [2].  A unit of SRM  2112 consists of a set of four specimens 
needed to perform a single verification.   SRM 2112 can also be used to verify the absorbed energy scale of the impact 
machine at the high-energy level.  When testing is performed at room temperature, the force and absorbed energy scales 
can be verified simultaneously.  This SRM can also be used to verify the absorbed energy scale at a test temperatu re of 
–40 °C, but no force information is available at this temperature.  
 
Material Description:   SRM 2112 is made from 4340 alloy steel.  The bars are finished to length, stamped, heat-treated, 
and machined in SRM specimen lots of approximately 1200  to 2000 specimens.  Each specimen has a lot number and 
an identification number (three or four digits). 
 
SRM Certification Procedure:  Specimens taken from each SRM lot were tested by the NIST Applied Chemicals and 
Materials  Division on Charpy reference machines for absorbed energy, and via an interla
boratory comparison 
(round-robin) [3] for maximum force.    These data were statistically evaluated to assure the homogeneity of the lot, 
establish certified values , and  determine the number of SRM specimens required for a user to perform a val
id 
verification.  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confiden ce in its accuracy, in that all 
known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into a
ccount [4].   The measurands are absorbed 
energy as measured by the NIST Charpy reference machines, and maximum force as established from the interlaboratory 
comparison.    Traceability is to the SI units joule (absorbed energy) and kilonewton (force
).    The certifie d values 
determined for the SRM 2112 specimens are given in Tables 1 and 2. 
 
Expiration of Certification:    The certified values and uncertainties furnished in this c ertificate are valid indefinitely. 
The indirect verification result for the absorbed energy scale is valid for one year from the date  on which  the SRM was 
tested.    If a user’s machine is moved or undergoes any major repairs or adjustments, the current verification  will be 
invalidated,  and  the  machine  must  be  retested  and  reverified (see “Instructions for Handling, Storage, and Use”).
  
Currently, there are no requirements for the  verification of the force  scale.  However, it is recommended to verify the 
calibration of the instrumented striker of the small -scale Charpy machine every time the striker undergoes repairs or 
adjustment, or damage is suspected, and every time the impact machine is indirectly verified for absorbed energy. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:   NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certifica tion.  If substantive 
e 
technical changes occur that affect the certification bef
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification.

Expanded Uncertainty 

(a) The uncertainties in the certified values provided are expanded uncertainties about

 the means to cover the measurands. 

  The 

expanded uncertainty is calculated as  U  =  kuc, where  uc  represents the combined uncertainty consistent with the ISO/JCGM 
Guide [5].  For room temperature, the coverage factor  k = 1.9944 is based on 70 effective degrees of freedom and corresponds to 
an approximate 95 % confidence interval. For –40 °C, the coverage factor k = 1.9955 is based on 68 effective degrees of freedom 
and corresponds to an approximate 95 % confidence interval.

(a) The uncertainty in the certified value provided is an expanded uncertainty about the me an to cover the measurand.  The expanded 
uncertainty is calculated as U = kuc, where uc represents the combined uncertainty consistent with the ISO/JCGM Guide  [5].  The 
coverage factor k = 2.447 is based on 6 effective degrees of freedom and corresponds to an approximate 95 % confidence interval.  

 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
Handling:  The protective oil coating should be wiped from each specimen with a lint-free cloth just prior to testing. 
 
Storage:  The SRM is anticipated to have an indefinite shelf life under normal storage conditions (20 °C ± 20 °C, ≤ 50 % 
relative humidity).  
 
Use:  Prior to verifying a Charpy machine equipped with an 8 -mm striker , the machine should be checked to ensure 
compliance with the appropriate sections of the applicable ASTM or ISO standard.  SRM 2112 is typically tested at room 
temperature (21 °C ± 1 °C) using an instrumented 8 -mm striker, so that both the absorbed energy scale and  the force 
scale can be verified in accordance with the applicable standard (ASTM or ISO ).  However, SRM 2112 can  also be 
tested at –40 °C ± 1 °C using an 8-mm striker when no force data is needed.  
 
SRM 2112 can be used to meet the indirect verification requirements of ASTM E23 and ISO 148-2 [6,7].  When using 
SRM 2112, the user performs a self -service verification of the test machine. The data and specimens  are not returned 
to NIST following the test. NIST provides no letter or certification sticker for the machine tested. 
 
The energy level of the SRM appropriate for verifying the performance of a particular Charpy machine can be determined 
by considering the energy for the SRM, the maximum capacity of the machine, and the requirements of the applicable test 
method (ASTM or ISO). 
 
For questions concerning  the production or use of  this SRM please contact  the NIST Charpy Program Coordinator as 
follows: telephone (303) 497-3351; fax (303) 497-5939; or e-mail charpy@boulder.nist.gov.
