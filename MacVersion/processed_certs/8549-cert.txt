Report of Investigation 
Reference Materials 8549, 8558, 8568 and 8569 
Nitrogen and Oxygen Isotopes in Nitrate 
 
These Reference Materials (RMs) are intended for use in developing and validating methods for measuring relative 
differences in nitrogen (N) and oxygen (O) isotope-amount ratios in nitrate.  While the values for these RMs are not 
certified, their widespread use permits comparability of data from different laboratories.  Equivalent names used by 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) for these RMs are listed 
in  column 2  of  Table 1.    RM  8549  is  supplied  in  plastic  vials  containing  approximately  0.4  g  of  KNO3  salt.  
RMs 8558  and  8568  are  supplied  in  glass  bottles  containing  approximately  0.9 g  of  KNO3  while  RM 8569  is 
supplied in glass bottles containing approximately 0.9 g of NaNO3.

Recommended values are given in Table 1 for relative N and O isotope-amount ratios.  Nitrogen isotope-amount 
ratios [n(15N)/n(14N)] are reported as δ15N values:  

δ15N  =  ([nsample(15N)/nsample(14N)]  –  [nAIR(15N)/nAIR(14N)])/[nAIR(15N)/nAIR(14N)] 

where AIR refers to tropospheric N2, for which nAIR(15N)/nAIR(14N) = 0.003677 [5–7]. 
The reported δ15N  results  for  nitrate  samples  have been normalized  to  yield  a value of  +180 ‰  for RM 8558 [1].  
Oxygen isotope-amount ratios [n(18O)/n(16O)] are reported as δ18O values: 

δ18O  =  ([nsample(18O)/nsample(16O)]/[nVSMOW(18O)/nVSMOW(16O)])  –  1 

where  VSMOW 
nVSMOW(18O)/nVSMOW(16O) = 0.0020052 [8]. 
Similarly, oxygen isotope-amount ratios [n(17O)/n(16O)] are reported as δ17O values: 

to  Vienna  Standard  Mean  Ocean  Water 

refers 

(RM 

8535), 

for  which 

δ17O  =  ([nsample(17O)/nsample(16O)]  –  [nVSMOW(17O)/nVSMOW(16O)])/ [nVSMOW(17O)/nVSMOW(16O)] 

where nVSMOW(17O)/nVSMOW(16O) = 0.0003799 [9]. 
By convention, the δ18O scale is normalized to yield a value of –55.5 ‰ for Standard Light Antarctic Precipitation 
(SLAP,  RM  8537)  [10,11].    For  RM 8549,  RM 8558,  RM  8568,  and  most  other  terrestrial  nitrate  samples,  major 
variations in δ 18O and δ 17O values may be expected to be related by:  

(1 + δ 17O)  =  (1 + δ 18O)λ  

where λ is an isotopic-mass-dependent coefficient having a value between 0.51 and 0.53.   
For atmospherically derived nitrate samples (including RM 8569), δ18O and δ17O values deviate markedly from this 
relation.  Deviations from mass dependent O isotope-amount-ratio variations have been described in different ways, 
depending  on  the  variability  and  use  of  the  data  [3,12,13].    Approximate  values  of  δ17O  for  the  RMs  can  be 
calculated  from  the  independent  measurements  of  δ18O  [2]  and  Δ17O  [3]  given  in  Table 1,  with  the  following 
equation [3]: 

Δ17O  =  [δ17O  –  0.52  ×  δ18O] 
The recommended values and uncertainties given in Table 1 are subject to revision as unknown sources of error may 
result in revised values that are not included within the stated uncertainties 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 

Storage and Handling:  Nitrate salts should be kept in a dry environment, as they will attract water when exposed 
to air.  These RMs should be dried in a low-temperature oven or under vacuum before being weighed for analysis.  
There  is  no  exchange  of  oxygen  in  nitrate  with  oxygen  in  water  except  in  strong  acid  conditions,  so  wetting  and 
drying these RMs should not affect their isotopic compositions unless other contaminants are present.  The Material 
Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) that accompany these RMs provide additional information about handling nitrate salts. 
 
 
Use:    Because  the  supplies  of  these  RMs  are  limited,  it  is  recommended  that  they  be  used  to  calibrate  or  check 
working  laboratory  standards  that  are  used  routinely.    Working  laboratory  standards  with  a  range  of  N  and 
O isotope-ratios  can  be produced  by  the  methods  described  by  J.K.  Böhlke,  C. Gwinn,  and  T.B.  Coplen  [14]  and 
J.K. Böhlke, S.J. Mroczkowski, and T.B. Coplen [2].   
 
Normalization  of  Data:    δ15N,  δ18O,  δ17O,  and  Δ17O  results  for  nitrate  samples  can  be  normalized  by  analyzing 
reference materials with δ15N, δ18O, δ17O, and Δ17O values that bracket those of the samples.  Generalized equations 
for normalization are given in several publications [10,15] and a database program for assisting with normalization 
is  available  [16].    Because  the  values  for  these  reference  materials  are  subject  to  change,  users  are  advised  to 
report  measured  or  assumed  values  for  the  normalizing  reference  materials  when  reporting  isotope  data  for 
samples.

PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS OF REFERENCE MATERIALS 

Preparation:  RM 8549 was prepared by A. Mariotti from KNO3 having normal terrestrial isotope-amount ratios 
[17].    RM  8558  was  prepared  by  J.K.  Böhlke,  C.  Gwinn,  and  T.B.  Coplen  by  dissolving  and  recrystallizing  a 
mixture  of  normal  and  15N-enriched  KNO3  [14].    RM  8568  and  RM  8569  were  prepared  by  J.K.  Böhlke, 
S.J. Mroczkowski,  and  T.B.  Coplen  [2].    RM  8568  was  prepared  by  equilibrating  nitric  acid  with  18O-depleted 
meteoric water, and neutralizing the mixture with KOH.  RM 8569 was purified from the natural nitrate ore deposits 
of the Atacama Desert in Chile.   
 
Analytical Methods:  δ15N - The reference values for δ15N of RM 8549 and RM 8558 were derived from results of 
an  interlaboratory  comparison  test  after  elimination  of  outliers  [1].    The  δ15N  values  were  measured  by  mass 
spectrometry on N2 gas that was produced from the nitrate by a variety of methods in the different laboratories.  The 
assigned reference value of +180 ‰ for RM 8558 was selected from a slightly skewed distribution of data around a 
mean value of +179.2 ‰ with a standard deviation of 1.3 ‰ (n = 11), based on the assumption that relatively low 
values were caused by lack of correction for contamination  by air or other contaminants [1].  The reference value is 
supported  by  subsequent  measurements  in  two  laboratories  using  both  continuous  flow  and  dual-inlet  mass 
spectrometry  on  N2  produced  by  high-temperature  reduction  of  nitrate  with  Cu  [4],  yielding  a  mean  value  of 
+180.1 ‰ with a standard deviation of 0.3 ‰ (n = 5).  It is also supported by an earlier measurement of +180.0 ‰ 
with a standard deviation of 0.2 ‰ (n = 6) [14].  These supporting values were calculated by assuming a value of 
+0.43 ‰ for RM 8547. 
 
The reference values for δ15N of RM 8568 and RM 8569 were determined by dual-inlet mass spectrometry on N2 gas 
that was produced from nitrate by off-line reduction with Cu at 850 °C [2].  These measurements were normalized to 
the recommended values of RM 8549 and RM 8558, which were analyzed by the same technique.   
δ18O,  Δ17O  -  The  reference  values  for  δ18O  of  the  nitrate  RMs  were  determined  by  continuous  flow  mass 
spectrometry  on  CO  gas  that  was  produced  from  nitrate  by  on-line  reaction  with  carbon  at  1325 °C  [2].    These 
measurements  were  normalized  to  the  VSMOW-SLAP  δ18O  scale  by  analyzing  water  samples  with  δ18OVSMOW 
values of -1.5 ‰ and -51.3 ‰ with the nitrate RMs by the same technique.  The Δ17O values were determined by 
dual-inlet  mass  spectrometry  on  O2  gas  that  was  produced  by  off-line  decomposition  of  nitrate  at  520 °C  [3].  
Thermal decomposition of nitrate produces NO2 in addition to O2.  Because of isotopic fractionation between NO2 
and O2, the measured δ18O values of the O2 are not equal to the nitrate δ18O values; however, the Δ17O values of the 
O2 were assumed to be unaffected by mass-dependent fractionation and thus equal to the nitrate values.  Users are 
advised that the definition of Δ17O may differ among laboratories [3,12,13].   
 
Isotopic Homogeneity:  There is no documented evidence for isotopic heterogeneity in the distributed supplies of 
these  reference  materials.    Aliquots  of  RM 8558  containing  20 micromole  of  nitrate  were  reported  to  yield 
reproducible δ15N results with a standard deviation of 0.16 ‰ (n = 15) [14].  Aliquots of RM 8568 and RM 8569 
containing  2.5 micromole  of  nitrate  were  reported  to  yield  reproducible  δ18O  results  with  a  standard  deviation  of 
0.11 ‰ (n = 25) and 0.14 ‰ (n = 24, 1 outlier), respectively [2].
