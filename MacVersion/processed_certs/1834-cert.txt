Standard  Reference  Material  1834 

Fused  Simulated  Ore  for  X-ray  Fluorescence  Spectrometry 

This  Standard  Reference  Material  (SRM)  is  intended  for  use  in  calibrating  x-ray  fluorescence  spectrometers.  It  may  be 
useful  in  particular  applications,  such  as  the  x-ray  spectrometric  analysis  of  rocks,  ores,  and  clays  in  which  the  samples  are 
fused  with  a  suitable  fluxing  agent,  such  as  lithium  tetraborate,  (LTB)  before  measurement.  SRM  1834  can  also  be  used  in 
quality  assurance  applications  and  to  monitor  instrument  stability. 

SRM  1834  is  a  silica  base  glass  disk  (3  cm  in  diameter  x  0.3  cm  thick)  that  was  prepared  at  NIST  (see  preparation  section). 
This  glass  material  has  about  the  same  elemental  composition  as  NIST  SRM  97a,  Flint  Clay,  with  the  amount  lost  on  ignition 
replaced  with  oxides  of  lithium  and  boron.  Therefore,  when  SRM  97a  is  fused,  the  resultant  glass  disk  should  give  similar 
x-ray  intensities  for  all  certified  elements  as  SRM  1834.  In  the  analysis  of  similar  fused  materials,  it  is  recommended  that 
appropriate  corrections  for  interelement  effects  be  applied. 

The  certified  constituent  elements  are  given  in  Table  1  and  are  based  on  measurements  made  using  at  least  two  or  more 
independent  analytical  methods.  Noncertified  values  are  given  in  Table  2  as  additional  information  on  the  matrix.  The 
noncertified  values  should  not  be  used  for  calibration  or  quality  control. 

USE: 
It  is 
If  the  SRM  is  to  be  routinely  used  as  supplied  it  may  be  necessary  to  resurface  the  disk  occasionally. 
recommended  that  any  resurfacing  be  performed  with  400  grit  abrasive  paper  in  the  dry  state  to  minimize  any  calcium 
contamination.  If  the  SRM is  to  be  shattered  for  the  purpose  of  preparing  fused  samples,  it  is  recommended  that  the  SRM 
be  first  wrapped in  several  layers  of  wax  or  glassine  paper  to  avoid  contamination. 

The  certification  of  this  SRM  is  valid  5  years  from  the  date  of  purchase  from  NIST.  Should  any  of  the  certified  values  change 
before  the  expiration  of  the  certification  period,  purchasers  will  be  notified  by  NIST. 

The  statistical  analysis  of  the  certification  data  was  performed  by  R.C.  Paule  of  the  National  Measurement  Laboratory. 

The  overall  direction  and  coordination  of  the  technical  measurements  leading  to  certification  were  under  the  direction  of 
P.A.  Pella  of  the  NIST  Gas  and  Particulate  Science  Division. 

The  technical  and  support  aspects  involved  in  the  certification  and  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the 
Standard  Reference  Materials  Program  by  T.E.  Gills.

The  material  for  this  SRM  was  fabricated  by  D.  Blackburn  and  D.  Kauffman  of  the  NIST  Glass  and  Optical  Material  Group, 
Ceramics  Division  of  the  National  Institute  for  Materials  Science  and  Engineering.  The  glass  material  was  prepared  by 
adding  a  known  amount  of  a  glass  containing  the  minor  constituents  to  a  melt  of  the  pure  compounds  comprising  the  major 
components.
