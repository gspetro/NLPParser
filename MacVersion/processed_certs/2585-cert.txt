Standard Reference Material 2585 
 
Organic Contaminants in House Dust 

 
ytical  methods  for  the  determination  of 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended for use in evaluating analytical methods for the determination of 
selected  polycyclic  aromatic  hydrocarbons (PAHs),  polychlorinated  biphenyl (PCB)  congeners,  chlorinated 
pesticides, polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners, synthetic musks, perfluorinated alkyl acids (PFAAs), 
hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD) isomers, and phosphorous flame retardants in house dust and similar matrices.  
All of the constituents for which certified, reference, and information values are provided in SRM 2585 were naturally 
present in the dust material before processing.  A unit of SRM 2585 consists of one bottle containing approximately 
10 g of house dust. 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values:  The certified values for selected PAHs, PCB congeners, chlorinated pesticides, 
and PBDE congeners in SRM 2585 are provided in Tables 1 through 4.  A NIST certified value is a value for which 
NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy and that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated 
or taken into account [1].  The measurands are the total mass fraction for each analyte on a dry-mass basis and are 
metrologically traceable to the International System of Units (SI).  The certified values for the PAHs, PCB congeners, 
and  chlorinated  pesticides  are  based  on  the  agreement  of  results  obtained  at  NIST  from  two  or  more  chemically 
independent analytical techniques while the certified values for the PBDE congeners are based on the agreement of 
results  obtained  at  NIST  from  two  or  more  chemically  independent  analytical  techniques  and  results  from  a 
collaborating laboratory [1,2].   
 
Expiration of Certification:  This certification of SRM 2585 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
ze  with  instructions  given  in  this  certificate 
until 01 June 2025, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with instructions given in this certificate 
(see “Instructions for Handing, Storage, and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, 
ified  if  the  SRM  is  damaged,  contaminated, 
or otherwise modified. 
 
tion.  If  substantive 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Overall  coordination  of  the  technical  measurements  leading  to  the  certification  of  SRM 2585  was  provided  by 
J.L  Reiner, M.M. Schantz, and S.A. Wise of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division. 
 
Analytical measurements for the certification of SRM 2585 were performed at NIST by J.R. Kucklick, J.M. Lynch, 
J.A. Murray,  M.S. Nocun,  A.M. Peck,  B.J. Porter,  D.L. Poster,  J.L.  Reiner,  M.M. Schantz,  S.S. Schuur,  and 
H.M. Stapleton of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division.   Additional  measurements  for  selected PBDE congeners 
were performed at the Meteorological Service of Canada, Environment Canada (Toronto, Canada) by T. Harner and 
M. Shoeib. 
 
Statistical consultation was provided by N.A. Heckert and S.D. Leigh of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division. 
 
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Office  of  Reference 
Materials.

NOTICE AND WARNING TO USERS 
 
SRM 2585 IS INTENDED FOR RESEARCH USE. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
Handling:  This material is naturally occurring house dust collected from a number of locations and may contain 
constituents of unknown toxicities; therefore, caution and care should be exercised during its handling and use. 
 
Storage:  SRM 2585 must be stored in its original bottle at temperatures less than 30 °C away from direct sunlight. 
 
Use:  Prior to removal of subsamples for analysis, the contents of the bottle should be mixed.  The mass fractions of 
constituents in SRM 2585 are reported on a dry-mass basis.  The SRM, as received, contains approximately 2.1 % 
moisture.  The dust sample should be dried to a constant mass before weighing for analysis, or if the constituents of 
interest are volatile, a separate subsample of the dust should be removed from the bottle at the time of analysis and 
dried to determine the mass fraction on a dry-mass basis. 
 
Conversion to Dry-Mass Basis:  The moisture content of the dust was determined by measuring the mass loss after 
freeze drying.  Six bottles of SRM 2585 were selected according to a stratified randomization scheme for the drying 
study.  Approximately 1 g of each glass bottle was transferred to a glass weighing vial and dried for 7 days at 1 Pa 
with 5 °C shelf temperature and a –46.9 °C condenser temperature.  The moisture content in SRM 2585 at the time of 
the  certification  analyses  was  2.11 %  ±  0.06 %  (95 %  confidence  level).    Analytical  results  for  the  organic 
constituents were determined on an as received mass fraction basis and then converted to a dry-mass fraction basis by 
dividing by the conversion factor of 0.9789 (g dry mass/g as received mass). 
 
Non-Certified Values:  Noncertified values are provided for additional constituents in SRM 2585. 
 
Reference Mass Fraction Values:  Based on the method used for each analyte, reference values are provided for 
additional measurands in Tables 5 through 11.  These values are metrologically traceable to calibration procedures 
and standards used by experienced analysts.  Reference values are noncertified values that are the best estimate of the 
true  value;  however,  the  values  do  not  meet  the  NIST  criteria  for  certification  and  are  provided  with  associated 
uncertainties that may reflect only measurement precision, may not include all sources of uncertainty, or may reflect 
a lack of sufficient statistical agreement among multiple analytical methods.   
 
Information Mass Fraction Values:  A NIST information value is considered to be a value that will be of interest 
and use to the SRM user, but insufficient information is available to assess adequately the uncertainty associated 
with the value or only a limited number of analyses were performed.  Information mass fraction values, expressed as 
mass fractions, for 9 additional PBDE congeners are provided in Table 12.  Information values cannot be used to 
establish metrological traceability.

PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Sample Collection:  The collection of SRM 2585 was under the direction of the Research Triangle Institute and the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (Research Triangle Park, NC).  The dust used for the preparation SRM 2585 
was taken from vacuum cleaner bags collected from homes, cleaning services, motels, and hotels in the states of North 
Carolina,  Maryland,  Ohio,  New  Jersey,  Montana,  and  Wisconsin  during  1993  and  1994.    The  dust  used  for  the 
preparation  of  SRM 2585  was  collected  at  the  same  time  and  from  the  same  locations  as  the  dust  used  for  the 
preparation of SRM 2583 Trace Elements in Indoor Dust, Nominal 90 mg/kg Lead [3] and SRM 2584 Trace Elements 
in Indoor Dust, Nominal 1 % Lead [4]. 
 
Sample Preparation:  The vacuum cleaner bags were first sterilized by gamma irradiation, receiving a minimum 
total dose of 2.5 mrads.  For the low lead material, SRM 2583, the contents of each vacuum cleaner bag was passed 
through a coarse screen (2 mm hole size) to remove cotton and debris.  Then using a vibrating stainless steel sieve 
apparatus, the resultant material was screened in two successive steps, first through a 250 µm sieve and then a 100 µm 
sieve.  For the high lead material, SRM 2584, the raw material from each bag was mixed and tumbled in a modified 
food processor using chopping blades and a compressed air jet.  While still tumbling, the dust was separated from 
unwanted debris by vacuuming through a series of screens into a clean HEPA vacuum cleaner.  The dust collected in 
this manner was then screened through a 90 µm stainless steel sieve using vibration and a vacuum.  Processed sublots 
of approximately 5 kg each were set aside and analyzed for lead by X-ray fluorescence to develop a blending protocol 
for the target lead concentrations in SRM 2584.  SRM 2585 was prepared from approximately 70 % of the material 
found to have 90 mg/kg nominal lead levels used for SRM 2583 and 30 % of the material that had the high lead content 
used for SRM 2584.  The selected sublots were blended in a cone blender and then bottled (approximately 10 g of 
dust per bottle) as SRM 2585. 
 
Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons 
 
The general approach used for the value assignment of the PAHs in SRM 2585 was similar to that reported for the 
recent certification of several environmental matrix SRMs [5−8] and consisted of combining results from analyses 
using  various  combinations  of  different  extraction  techniques  and  solvents,  cleanup/isolation  procedures,  and 
chromatographic separation and detection techniques.  The methods utilized Soxhlet extraction and pressurized fluid 
extraction (PFE) using dichloromethane (DCM) or a hexane/acetone mixture, cleanup of the extracts by solid phase 
extraction (SPE),  and  analysis  by  gas  chromatography/mass  spectrometry (GC/MS)  of  the  PAH  fraction  on  three 
stationary phases of different selectivity, i.e., a 50 % (mole fraction) phenyl-substituted methylpolysiloxane phase, a 
relatively non-polar proprietary phase, and a liquid crystalline phase. 
 
Seven sets of GC/MS results, designated as GC/MS (Ia), (Ib), (IIa), (IIb), (IIIa), (IIIb), and (IV) were obtained using 
three columns with different selectivities for the separation of PAHs.  For GC/MS (I and II) analyses, one subsample 
of approximately 1 g from six bottles of SRM 2585 was extracted using PFE with DCM [9].  The concentrated extract 
was passed through a silica SPE cartridge and eluted with 2 % DCM in hexane (volume fraction).  The processed 
extract  was  then  analyzed  by  GC/MS  using  a  0.25 mm i.d. × 60 m  fused  silica  capillary  column  with  50 % (mole 
fraction)  phenyl-substituted  methylpolysiloxane  phase  (0.25 μm  film  thickness)  (DB-17ms,  J&W  Scientific, 
Folsom, CA).  This method is designated as GC/MS (Ia) and GC/MS (IIa).  For GC/MS (Ib) and GC/MS (IIb), the 
same extracts were analyzed by GC/MS using a 0.25 mm i.d. × 15 m fused silica capillary column with dimethyl 50 % 
(mole  fraction)  liquid  crystalline  polysiloxane  phase  (0.25 μm  film  thickness)  (LC-50,  J&K  Environmental,  Nova 
Scotia, Canada).  The GC/MS (III) analyses were performed using duplicate subsamples of approximately 1 g from 
six bottles of SRM 2585.  These samples  were Soxhlet extracted for 18 h with 250 mL  of 50 % hexane and 50 % 
acetone (volume fraction).  The concentrated extract was passed through an aminopropyl SPE cartridge and eluted 
with 10 % DCM in hexane.  The fractions were concentrated, and the SPE step was repeated.  GC/MS analysis was 
performed  using  0.25 mm  i.d. × 60 m  fused  silica  capillary  column  with  a  relatively  non-polar  proprietary  phase 
(0.25 μm  film  thickness)  (DB-XLB,  J&W  Scientific)  for  method  GC/MS (IIIa)  and  a  50 %  phenyl-substituted 
methylpolysiloxane  phase  (0.25 μm  film  thickness)  (DB-17ms)  for  method  GC/MS (IIIb).    For  the  GC/MS (IV) 
analyses, approximately 1 g subsamples from six bottles of SRM 2585 were extracted using PFE with DCM.  The 
concentrated extract was passed through an alumina cartridge and eluted with 9 mL of 35 % DCM in hexane.  The 
processed extract was then analyzed by GC/MS using a 0.25 mm i.d. × 60 m fused silica capillary column with 50 % 
(mole fraction) phenyl-substituted methylpolysiloxane phase (0.25 μm film thickness) (DB-17ms).  For the GC/MS 
measurements described above, selected perdeuterated PAHs were added to the dust prior to solvent extraction for use 
as internal standards for quantification purposes.

Homogeneity Assessment for PAHs 
 
The homogeneity of SRM 2585 was assessed by analyzing duplicate samples of approximately 1 g from six bottles 
selected  by  stratified  random  sampling.    Samples  were  extracted,  processed,  and  analyzed  as  described  above  for 
GC/MS (IIIa  and  IIIb).    No  statistically  significant  differences  among  bottles  were  observed  for  the  PAHs  at  this 
sample size. 
 
PCBs and Chlorinated Pesticides 
 
The general approach used for the determination of PCBs and chlorinated pesticides in SRM 2585 was similar to that 
reported for the recent certification of several environmental matrix SRMs [5,7,10−12], and consisted of combining 
results from analyses using various combinations of different extraction techniques and solvents, cleanup/isolation 
procedures, and chromatographic separation and detection techniques.  This approach consisted of Soxhlet extraction 
and PFE using DCM or a hexane/acetone mixture, cleanup/isolation using normal-phase liquid chromatography (LC) 
or SPE followed by analysis using GC/MS and gas chromatography with electron capture detection (GC-ECD) on 
three columns with different selectivity for the separation of PCBs and chlorinated pesticides. 
 
Four sets of results were obtained, designated as GC-ECD (I), GC/MS (I), GC/MS (II), and GC/MS (III).  For 
GC-ECD (I) and GC/MS (I), subsamples of approximately 1 g from six bottles of SRM 2585 were extracted 
using PFE with DCM.  The concentrated extract was fractionated by LC on a semi-preparative aminopropylsilane 
column to isolate two fractions containing (1) the PCB congeners and lower polarity pesticides using hexane as the 
mobile phase and (2) the more polar pesticides using 25 % DCM in hexane as the mobile phase.  Each concentrated 
fraction was passed through a silica SPE cartridge with 25 % DCM in hexane, concentrated, and then analyzed by 
GC-ECD and by GC/MS both using a 0.25 mm i.d. × 60 m fused silica capillary column with a relatively non-polar 
proprietary phase (0.25 μm film thickness) (DB-XLB).  PCB 30, PCB 103, and perdeuterated 4,4'-DDT were added 
prior to extraction for use as internal standards for quantification purposes.  For GC/MS (II), duplicate subsamples of 
approximately 1 g from six bottles of SRM 2585 were Soxhlet extracted for 18 h with 250 mL of 50 % hexane and 
50 % acetone (volume fraction).  The concentrated extract was passed through an aminopropyl SPE cartridge and 
eluted with 10 % DCM in hexane.  The fractions were concentrated, and the SPE step was repeated.  GC/MS analysis 
was  performed  using  0.25 mm i.d. × 60 m  fused  silica  capillary  column  with  a  50 %  phenyl-substituted 
methylpolysiloxane phase (0.25 μm film thickness) (DB-17ms).  For the GC/MS (II) analyses, selected  13C-labeled 
PCB congeners and chlorinated pesticides were added to the dust prior to extraction for use as internal standards for 
quantification purposes.  For the GC/MS (III) analyses, approximately 1 g subsamples from six bottles of SRM 2585 
were extracted using PFE with DCM.  The concentrated extract was passed through an alumina cartridge and eluted 
with 9 mL of 35 % DCM in hexane.  The processed extract was then analyzed by GC/MS using a 0.25 mm i.d. × 60 m 
fused silica capillary column with 5 % (mole fraction) phenyl-substituted methylpolysiloxane phase (0.25 μm film 
thickness) (DB-5ms, J&W Scientific).  Electron impact mass spectrometry was used for all of the analytes except for 
the chlordanes and nonachlors, which were quantified using negative chemical ionization for GC/MS (III).  For the 
GC/MS (III)  analyses,  selected  13C-labeled  PCB  congeners,  13C-labeled  trans-chlordane,  and  selected  deuterated 
pesticides were added to the dust prior to extraction for use as internal standards for quantification purposes. 
 
Homogeneity Assessment for PCBs and Chlorinated Pesticides:  The homogeneity of SRM 2585 was assessed by 
analyzing duplicate samples of approximately 1 g from six bottles selected by stratified random sampling.  Samples 
were extracted, processed, and analyzed as described above for GC/MS (II).  No statistically significant differences 
NCes 
among bottles were observed for the chlorinated analytes at this sample size. 
 
Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers 
 
Value assignment of mass fractions for PBDE congeners was based on four sets of measurements (three sets from 
NIST and one set from a collaborating laboratory) using a variety of different extraction, cleanup, and quantification 
methods.    All  measurements  were  performed  by  using  GC/MS  operated  in  either  electron  impact  (GC/EI-MS)  or 
negative chemical ionization (GC/NCI-MS) mode. 
 
dust
For two of the NIST measurement sets, GC/NCI-MS (I) and GC/EI-MS (I), between 0.5 g and 1 g subsamples of dust 
from each of four bottles were extracted using PFE with DCM.  The concentrated extract was placed on a silica SPE 
cartridge  and  eluted  with  hexane.    The  extracts  were  analyzed  by  using  both  GC/EI-MS  and  GC/NCI-MS  on  a 
0.25 mm × 15 m fused silica capillary column with a 5 % (mole fraction) phenyl-substituted methylpolysiloxane phase 
(0.25 μm film thickness) (DB-5ms).  For both methods 13C-labeled 2,2',3,4,5-pentachlorodiphenyl ether (CDE 86L) 
and  13C-labeled 2,2',3,3',4,4',5,5',6,6'-decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE 209L) were added to the dust sample prior to 
extraction for use as internal standards for quantification purposes.
