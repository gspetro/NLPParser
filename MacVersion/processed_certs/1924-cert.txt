This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended prim arily for use in calibration and performance evaluation of 
instruments used to determine molecular weight and molecular weight distribution by size exclusion chromatography 
(SEC) or gel filtration chromatography.    SRM 1924 is supplied in the form of a white porous mat easily sampled by 
cutting with clean scissors and in units of 0.2 g.  
 
This material is certified for weight-average molecular weight (Mw): 
 
Mw = 120.9 x 103 ± 9.0 x 103 g/molea 
 
aCombined expanded uncertainty, U (see Table 1). 
 
The above uncertainty was calculated by a procedure complying with the description in NIST Technical Note 1297 [1]. 
  
 
Source:  This poly(ethylene oxide) was prepared by Polymer Labs, Church Stretton, Shropshire, England. 
 
Expiration of Certification:   This certificate will be valid for five years from the date of shipment from NIST, when 
maintained under recommended storage conditions.  
 
Homogeneity and Material Characterization:   The homogeneity of the polymer was tested by SEC analysis of 
solutions in water at 30 °C.  The Mw was determined by Rayleigh light scattering.  The M w/Mn ratio (Mn is the number-
average molecular weight) was estimated as 1.04 from the SE
e characterization of this 
poly(ethylene oxide) by SEC and by light scattering is described in NISTIR 5286 [2]. 
  
A high molecular weight peak, distinctly  remote from the main peak, occasiona lly appeared in chromatograms during 
an aging study of another poly(ethylene oxide) standard by  aqueous SEC.  The high molecular weight peak can be 
removed by heating the solution  at 50  °C for 1 h.  In order to avoid degradati on, solutions of the standard should be 
freshly prepared before each SEC calibration. 
 
Storage:  SRM 1924 is provided bottled in an environment of dry  argon.  The polymer sample should be stored in the 
original bottle tightly closed and in a desiccator, under normal laboratory conditions. 
 
The technical coordination leading to certification of this material was provided by C.C. Han, with technical 
measurement and data interpretation provided by C.M. Guttman and J.R. Maurey all of the NIST Polymers Division. 
 
The technical and support aspects involved in the preparation, certification, and issuance of this SRM were coordinated 
through the Standard Reference Materials Program by J.C. Colbert.
