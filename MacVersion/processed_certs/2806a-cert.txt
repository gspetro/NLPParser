Certificate of Analysis 
Standard Reference Material 2806a 

 

 
Medium Test Dust (MTD) in Hydraulic Fluid 

ration  of  instrument  response  to 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended for use in the calibration of instrument response to medium test 
dust suspended in hydraulic fluid.  A unit of SRM 2806a consists of a two-bottle set of a polydisperse, irregularly 
shaped mineral dust suspended in approximately 400 mL of hydraulic fluid at a nominal concentration of 2.8 mg/L. 
 
Certified  Values:    Certification  of  this  SRM  is  in  terms  of  the  projected  area  diameters  of  the  collected  dust 
particles from the hydraulic fluid and the numeric concentration of particles greater than each diameter, referred to 
as cumulative number size distribution.   Certified diameter values from 1 µm to 30 µm  are given in Table 1a and 
plotted in Figure 1.  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy, in 
that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [1]. 
 
Information Values:  Values greater than 30 µm given in Table 1b are provided for information only and are not 
certified due to high measurement uncertainty.  An information value is considered to be a value that may be of use 
to the SRM user, but insufficient information is available to assess the uncertainty associated with the value or only 
a limited number of analyses were performed [1]. 
 
SRM 2806a  can  be  used  in  conjunction  with  the  International  Organization  for  Standardization (ISO)  method 
ISO/FDIS 11171, “Hydraulic Fluid Power - Calibration of Liquid Automatic Particle Counters” [2]. 
 
Expiration  of  Certification:    The  certification  of  SRM 2806a  is  valid,  within  the  measurement  uncertainty 
ored  in  accordance  with  instructions  given 
specified, until 31 December 2014, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with instructions given 
in this certificate (see “Instructions for Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, or 
is  nullified  if  the  SRM  is  damaged,  contaminated,  or 
otherwise modified and exposed to excess heat (>80 °C). 
 
Maintenance  of  SRM  Certification:    NIST  will  monitor  this  SRM  over  the  period  of  its  certification.    If 
substantive  technical changes occur that affect the certification before the expiration of this certificate, NIST  will 
notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification.  
 
The coordination of the technical measurements leading to the certification of SRM 2806a was under the leadership 
1ent  Science  Division
of R.A. Fletcher of the NIST Materials Measurement Science Division. 
 
Sample  preparation,  microscopy,  and  scanning  electron  microscopy (SEM)  imaging  were  performed  by 
J.R. Verkouteren, E.S. Windsor, J.A. Small, and E.B. Steel.  D.S. Bright developed the image processing software 
and  provided  assistance.    R.A. Fletcher  provided  homogeneity  testing  and  SEM  digital  image  processing  data 
analysis.  The aforementioned staff members are from the NIST Materials Measurement Science Division. 
 
Statistical consultation was provided by W.S. Liggett formerly of the NIST Information Access and User Interfaces 
Division. 
 
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Office  of  Reference 
Materials.

SRM 2806a 

SAMPLE PREPARATION( 1) 
 
The  medium  test  dust,  ISO 12103-A3  (ISO  Medium  Test  Dust) [3]  lot  number 4390C,  used  for  the  preparation  of 
SRM 2806a  was  donated  by  Powder  Technology  Inc.  (Burnsville, MN).    Suspension  of  the  dust  in  MIL-H 5606 
hydraulic fluid was performed by Fluid Technology Inc. (Stillwater, OK). 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 
 
SRM 2806a should be mixed and sampled according to procedures described in reference 2.  Only if the  sampled 
volume is decanted immediately after the prescribed mixing does the quantity of the SRM left in the original bottle 
remain certified (see “Sampling for Liquid Automatic Particle Counter” section).  The SRM should not be heated 
above  80 °C  and  the  bottle  should  be  opened  and  sampled  in  a  dust-free  environment  so  as  to  avoid  potential 
contamination. 
 
Sampling for Liquid Automatic Particle Counter 
 
Immediately before use,  mix  SRM 2806a in accordance with instructions in reference 2.  Shake a closed bottle of 
SRM 2806a by hand for approximately 30 s.  Ultrasonically disperse contents of bottle using a bath with minimum 
power of 5 W/cm2.  Mechanically shake for a minimum of 1 min on a commercial paint or laboratory shaker.  Then 
ultrasonicate  briefly  or  evacuate  to  remove  air  bubbles  from  the  suspension  and  introduce  immediately  into  the 
optical particle counter.  CAUTION:  If the suspension is not used immediately after shaking and evacuation, large 
particles will settle to the bottom of the bottle and be omitted from the particle population measured. 
 
NIST Certification Method(2) 
 
The bottle-to-bottle homogeneity was determined using an HIAC Royco HR-LD 150 laser light extinction particle 
counter [4].    Material  inhomogeneity  was  negligible  with  respect  to  the  measurement  uncertainty.    The  particle 
size [5]  and  numbers  measured  for  certifying  this  material  were  determined  from  digital  images  of  dust  particles 
extracted from aliquots of four bottles of the oil by filtration.  These images were collected using a SEM operating in 
the  backscattered  electron  mode.    Particle  area  was  determined  by  “blobbing,”  an  image  processing  method  that 
sums  the  pixels  in  a  gray-level  thresholded (binary)  domain  that  defines  the  particle [6].    The  particle  diameter  is 
expressed  as  the  projected  area  diameter  of  a  stable  oriented  particle  (diameter  of  a  circular  particle  with  an  area 
equivalent to the area of a particle in stable orientation). 
 
Five SEM magnifications were used to obtain particle size data from particles ranging in size from 1 µm to 50 µm.  
he  conversion  of  pixel  dimension  to  metric
NIST SRM 484d SEM Magnification Standard was used to determine the conversion of pixel dimension to metric 
value.  More than 775 000 particles were sized from approximately 4400 SEM image fields.  Technical details of the 
measurement process are available in reference 4. 
 
Round Robin Results:  A round robin  was conducted  within the NFPA T2.9 Contamination Committee by three 
companies utilizing five instruments and five different sensors to compare counter and sensor response.  SRM 2806a 
was measured using instruments that were calibrated in accordance with the existing ISO 4402:1991 Standard.  The 
laboratories and their results are presented in Table 2. 
 

                                                           

(1)Certain commercial instruments, materials, or processes are identified in this report to adequately specify the experimental 
procedure.    Such  identification  does  not  imply  recommendation  or  endorsement  by  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and 
Technology,  nor  does  it  imply  that  the  instruments,  materials,  or  processes  identified  are  necessarily  the  best  available  for  the 
purpose. 

(2)The particle size was determined for the dust particles in their most mechanically stable orientation and thus the particle 
area approaches, on average, the largest possible value.  Literature values for the ratio of mean projected diameters for random 
and for stable oriented quartz particles (common to ISO Medium Test Dust) is approximately 0.8.

(a) Certified  number  of  particles  per  milliliter  of  hydraulic  fluid  greater  than  the  indicated  diameter  (number  per  milliliter)  at  

approximately 25 °C. 

(b) Stable particle projected area diameter [6], the standard uncertainty components (u), the combined standard uncertainties (Uc)

and the expanded uncertainties (U) in the projected area diameter. 

(c) Type A uncertainties evaluated by statistical methods. 
(d) Type B uncertainties evaluated by other means. 

 

NIST  Certified  Uncertainties:    The  expanded  uncertainties  listed  in  Table 1a  were  calculated  according  to  the 
ISO/JCGM  Guide [8].    These  uncertainties  correspond  to  the  expanded  uncertainties  in  particle  projected  area 
diameters,  which  are  twice  (coverage  factor  k = 2)  the  combined  standard  uncertainties.    In  cases  where  all 
uncertainties are Type A, then k = 2 level defines a confidence interval of approximately 95 %. 
 
Each  combined  standard  uncertainty  is  the  square  root  of  the  sum-of-the-squares  of  the  individual  standard 
uncertainty  derived  or  estimated  from  the  measurement  process.    The  Type A  and  Type B  standard  uncertainty 
components  arise  from  measurement  uncertainties  in  the  following  sources:    (1) particle  sampling  and  particle 
counting 
image 
representation/processing, and (5) subsampling the bottle, which entails size fractionation due to fluid transfer. 

(3) SEM  magnification, 

(Poisson  counting),
