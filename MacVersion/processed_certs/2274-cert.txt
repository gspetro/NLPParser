Standard Reference Material® 2274 
 
Polychlorinated Biphenyl Congeners in 2,2,4-Trimethylpentane 
 
This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  a  solution  of  11  polychlorinated  biphenyl (PCB)  congeners  in 
2,2,4-trimethylpentane (isooctane) intended primarily for use in the calibration of chromatographic instrumentation.  
A unit of SRM 2274 consists of five 2 mL ampoules, each containing approximately 1.2 mL of solution. 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values:  The certified mass fraction values for PCB congeners are given in Table 1.  These 
values are based on results obtained from the gravimetric preparation of the solution and from the analytical results 
determined by using gas chromatography with electron capture detection (GC-ECD).  A NIST certified value is a 
value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias have 
been  investigated  or  accounted  for  by  NIST [1].    The  measurands  are  the  PCB  congeners  listed  in  Table 1,  and 
metrological traceability is to the SI derived units for mass fraction, expressed as milligrams per kilogram. 
 
Supplemental  Information:    A  summary  of  the  gravimetric  and  GC-ECD  measurements  for  SRM 2274  is 
provided in Table 2.  This information is NOT to be used as a substitute for NIST certified values.  Chemical 
Abstracts Service (CAS) Nomenclature and Registry Numbers of the certified components are listed in Table 3.  A 
representative chromatogram from the GC-ECD analysis is shown in Figure 1. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification SRM 2274 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until  31 January 2030, provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and stored  in  accordance with  the  instructions given  in  this 
certificate (see “Instructions for Storage, Handling, and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, 
contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Coordination of the technical measurements leading to the certification of this SRM was performed by M.M. Schantz 
and S.A. Wise of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division. 
 
Statistical  consultation  was  provided  by  S.B. Schiller  and  S.D. Leigh  of  the  NIST  Statistical  Engineering 
Division. 
 
Partial  support  for  the  preparation  and  certification  of  this  SRM  was  provided  by  the  National  Oceanic  and 
Atmospheric Administration, National Ocean Service, Center for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment, Silver 
Spring, MD. 
 
Preparation  and  analytical  measurements  of  the  SRM  were  performed  by  M.P. Cronise  of  the  NIST  Office  of 
Reference Materials and R.M. Parris and D.L. Poster of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division. 
 
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Office  of  Reference 
Materials.

NOTICE AND WARNING TO USERS:  SRM 2274 IS INTENDED FOR RESEARCH USE. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
Handling:    This  SRM  contains  PCBs,  many  of  which  have  been  reported  to  have  toxic,  mutagenic,  and/or 
carcinogenic properties.  Therefore, this material should be handled with care.  Use proper methods for disposal of 
wastes. 
 
Storage:  Sealed ampoules, as received, should be stored in the dark at temperatures between 10 °C and 30 °C. 
 
Use:  Open ampoules carefully to prevent contamination and injury.  The ampoules are pre-scored and should NOT be 
opened using a file.  Sample aliquots for analysis should be withdrawn at 20 °C to 25 °C immediately after opening 
an ampoule and should be processed without delay for the certified values in Table 1 to be valid within the stated 
uncertainties.  Because of the volatility of 2,2,4-trimethylpentane, certified values are not applicable to material stored 
in ampoules that have been opened for more than 5 minutes, even if they are resealed. 
 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS 
 
The PCB congeners used in the preparation of this SRM were obtained from AccuStandard (New Haven, CT).  The 
solution was prepared at NIST by weighing and mixing the individual PCB congeners and 2,2,4-trimethylpentane.  
The  total  mass  of  this  solution was  measured  and  the  concentrations  calculated  for  the components (see  Table 2).  
These  gravimetric  concentrations  were  adjusted  for  the  consensus  purity  estimation  of  each  component  that  was 
determined using capillary gas chromatography with flame ionization detection, differential scanning calorimetry, and 
the purity assay information from the component suppliers.  This bulk solution was then chilled to approximately 
–5 °C.  From the bulk solution, 1.2 mL aliquots were dispensed into argon-flushed 2 mL amber glass ampoules, which 
were then flame sealed. 
 
Aliquots  were  taken  from  nine  ampoules  which  were  selected  by  random-stratified  sampling.    The  aloquots  were 
analyzed in duplicate by using GC-ECD employing an immobilized non-polar stationary phase column.  An internal 
standard solution containing PCB 103 and PCB 198 was added to each sample for quantification purposes.  Calibration 
solutions consisting of weighed amounts of the PCB congeners (adjusted for the consensus purity estimation) and 
internal  standard  compounds  in  2,2,4-trimethylpentane  were  chromatographically  analyzed  to  determine  analyte 
response factors.  The analytical values determined for the compounds also are given in Table 2.

(a) The PCB congener numbering scheme used here is as published by Ballschmiter and Zell [2] with revised numbering sequence 
as noted by Schulte and Malisch [3] in which the PCB congeners are numbered in accordance with IUPAC rules.  For the specific 
congeners in this SRM, the Ballschmiter-Zell numbers correspond to those of Schulte and Malisch. 

») 
(b) The  certified  value  is  the  unweighted  average  of  the  concentrations  determined  by  gravimetric  and  chromatographic 
measurements.  The expanded uncertainty, at the 95 % level of confidence, is calculated as U = kuc, where uc is a combined 
standard uncertainty calculated according to the ISO and NIST Guides [4] and k = 2 is the coverage factor.  The value of uc 
includes  both  a  correction  for  estimated  purity  and  an  allowance  for  differences  between  the  concentration  determined  by 
fgravimetric preparation and chromatographic measurements. 

(c) The concentrations in microgram per milliliter units were obtained by multiplying the certified values in milligrams per kilogram 
(prior to rounding) by the measured density of the SRM solution at 22 °C (0.6899 g/mL).  These concentrations are for use over 
the temperature range of 20 °C to 25 °C, and an allowance for the change in density over this temperature range is included in 
the uncertainties.
