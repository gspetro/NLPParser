Soy Protein Concentrate 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended primarily for validation of methods for determining isoflavones 
in soy protein concentrates and in similar matrices.  This SRM can also be used for quality assurance when assigning 
values to in-house reference materials.  A unit of SRM 3237 consists of 5 packets, each containing approximately 10 g 
of material. 
 
The  development  of  SRM  3237  was  a  collaboration  between  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and 
Technology (NIST) and the National Institutes of Health, Office of Dietary Supplements (NIH-ODS). 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Value:  The certified mass fraction value for daidzin (as the total glycoside) in SRM 3237 
is provided in Table 1.  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy 
in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [1].  Analyses for value 
assignment were performed by NIST, and certified values were calculated as the equally weighted mean of the mean 
values from NIST methods.  The associated uncertainties are expressed at the 95 % level of confidence [2–4].  Values 
are reported on a dry-mass basis in mass fraction units [5]. 
 
Reference  Mass  Fraction  Values:  The  reference  mass  fraction  values  for  genistin  and  glycitin  (as  the  total 
glycosides) are provided in Table 2.  Reference values are noncertified values that are the best estimate of the true 
values based on available data; however, the values do not meet the NIST criteria for certification [1] and are provided 
with  associated  uncertainties  that  may  reflect  only  measurement  reproducibility,  may  not  include  all  sources  of 
uncertainty, or may reflect a lack of sufficient statistical agreement among multiple analytical methods.  
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 3237 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until  15  August  2019,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  given  in  this 
certificate (see “Instructions for Storage and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, 
or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
dration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
cilitate  notification. 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Support for the development of SRM 3237 was provided in part by NIH-ODS.  Technical consultation was provided by 
J.M. Betz of NIH-ODS.  
 
The  overall  direction  and  coordination  of  the  technical  measurements  leading  to  the  certification  of  this  SRM  were 
performed by M.M. Phillips, L.C. Sander, K.E. Sharpless, and S.A. Wise of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division. 
 
Analytical measurements at NIST were performed by M. Bedner, M.A. Nelson, M.M. Phillips, B.J. Porter, and L.J. Wood 
of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division. 
 
Statistical analysis was provided by J.H. Yen of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division.

NOTICE AND WARNING TO USERS 
 
SRM 3237 IS INTENDED FOR LABORATORY USE ONLY, NOT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE AND USE 
 
Storage:  The original unopened packets of SRM 3237 should be stored at controlled room temperature (20 °C to 
25 °C).  Once the packet is opened, the long-term stability of all analytes in SRM 3237 is unknown.  Therefore, the 
certification only applies to the initial use and the same results are not guaranteed if the remaining powder is used 
longer than two months after opening. 
 
Use:  Prior to removal of a test portion for analysis, the contents of a packet of material should be mixed thoroughly; 
by shaking the packet and allowing the contents to settle for one minute prior to opening to minimize the loss of fine 
particles.  For certified values to be valid, a test portion of at least 200 mg should be used; the homogeneity of test 
portions less than 200 mg has not been evaluated. Results obtained in analyses should include their own estimates of 
uncertainty  and  can  be  compared  to  the  certified  values  using  procedures  described  in  reference  6.    Test  portions 
should be analyzed as received and results converted to a dry-mass basis by determining moisture content (described 
below) on a separate test portion. 
 
SOURCE, PREPARATION, AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Source and Preparation:  SRM 3237 is a soy protein isolate prepared by a manufacturer of food and agricultural 
products.    The  product  was  packaged  into  single-use,  nitrogen-flushed  pouches,  each  containing  10  g  of  powder.  
Following  packaging,  SRM  3237  was  irradiated  (Neutron  Products,  Inc.,  Dickerson,  MD)  to  an  absorbed  dose  of 
6.0 kGy to 10.0 kGy. 
 
NIST  Analyses  for  Isoflavones  Using  Isotope  Dilution  Liquid  Chromatography  with  Mass  Spectrometric 
Detection (ID-LC/MS):  Mass fractions of daidzin, genistin, and glycitin were measured at NIST using ID-LC/MS.  
Calibrants were prepared gravimetrically, at levels intended to approximate the levels of the isoflavones in the SRM.  
Internal standards were employed; a single solution was used for the calibrants and samples.  Duplicate 700 mg test 
portions of powder from each of 6 packets were accurately weighed into 15 mL polyethylene centrifuge tubes.  An 
aliquot  of  a  mixed  internal  standard  solution  containing  13C6-daidzin,  13C6-genistin,  and  13C6-glycitin  was  added.  
Analytes  were  extracted  from  the  sample,  then  hydrolyzed  to  convert  acetyl-  and  malonyl-glycosides  to  free 
glycosides,  neutralized,  diluted,  and  centrifuged  prior  to  injection.    Details  of  the  separation  and  a  typical 
chromatogram are provided in Figure 1.  The separation was monitored using an absorbance detector at 260 nm, but 
MS  was  used  for  quantitation.    Daidzin  and  13C6-daidzin  were  monitored  at  m/z  417  and  m/z  423,  respectively.  
Genistin  and  13C6-genistin  were  monitored  at  m/z  433  and  m/z  439,  respectively.    Glycitin  and  13C6-glycitin  were 
monitored at m/z 447 and m/z 453, respectively. 
 
NIST Analyses for Isoflavones Using Liquid Chromatography with Absorbance Detection (LC/absorbance):  
Mass  fractions  of  daidzin,  genistin,  and  glycitin  were  measured  at  NIST  using  LC/absorbance.    Calibrants  were 
prepared gravimetrically,  at  levels  intended  to  approximate  the  levels of  the  isoflavones  in  the  SRM.   An  internal 
standard  approach  was utilized with  a  single  solution  used for  the  calibrants  and  samples.  Duplicate 200  mg  test 
portions of powder from each of 10 packets were accurately weighed into 15 mL polyethylene centrifuge tubes.  An 
aliquot of an internal standard solution containing sissotrin was added.  Analytes were extracted from the sample, then 
hydrolyzed to convert acetyl- and malonyl-glycosides to free glycosides, neutralized, diluted, and centrifuged prior to 
injection.    Details  of  the  separation  and  a  typical  chromatogram  are  provided  in  Figure  2.    The  separation  was 
monitored and quantitation performed using an absorbance detector at 254 nm. 
 
Determination of Moisture:  Moisture content of SRM 3237 was determined at NIST (see “Instructions for Storage 
and Use”) by (1) freeze drying to constant mass over 8 days; (2) drying over magnesium perchlorate in a desiccator 
at room temperature for 26 days; and (3) drying for 2 h in a forced air oven at 90 °C.  The results obtained using all 
three  techniques  were  averaged  to  determine  a  conversion  factor  of  (0.942  ±  0.003)  gram  dry  mass  per  gram  as 
received mass, which was used to convert data from an as-received to a dry-mass basis; the uncertainty shown on this 
value is an expanded uncertainty.  An uncertainty component for the conversion factor (0.15 %) obtained from the 
moisture measurements is incorporated in the uncertainties of the certified values, reported on a dry-mass basis, that 
are provided in this certificate. 

                                                           

(1)  Certain  commercial  equipment,  instruments  or  materials  are  identified  in  this  certificate  to  adequately  specify  the 
experimental procedure.  Such identification does not imply recommendation or endorsement by the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the purpose.

Homogeneity Assessment:  The homogeneity of isoflavones in the SRM was assessed at NIST using the methods 
and  test  portion  sizes  described  above  and  analyses  of  variance  with  5  %  significance  level;  because  of  possible 
inhomogeneity, an uncertainty component for heterogeneity is incorporated in the combined uncertainty of each value. 
 
Value Assignment:  The equally weighted mean of NIST results provided by LC/absorbance and ID-LC/MS were 
used to calculate assigned values. 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Value for Daidzin:  The certified mass fraction value for daidzin is the mean from the 
combination of the mean results provided by LC/absorbance and ID-LC/MS by NIST.  The uncertainty provided is an 
expanded uncertainty about the mean to cover the measurand with approximately 95 % confidence.  The expanded 
uncertainty  is  calculated  as  U  =  kuc,  where  uc  incorporates  the  observed  difference  between  the  results  from  the 
methods and their respective uncertainties, and uncertainty components related to moisture correction and to possible 
inhomogeneity,  consistent  with  the  ISO/JCGM  Guide  and  with  its  Supplement  1,  and  k  is  a  coverage  factor 
corresponding to approximately 95 % confidence [2-4].  The measurand is the total mass fraction of daidzin in soy 
protein concentrate.  The certified value is metrologically traceable to the SI unit of mass.

Reference Mass Fraction Values for Genistin and Glycitin:  The reference mass fraction values for genistin and 
glycitin are the mean from the combination of the mean results provided by LC/absorbance and ID-LC/MS by NIST.  
The uncertainty provided with each value is an expanded uncertainty about the mean to cover the measurand with 
approximately  95  %  confidence.    The  expanded  uncertainty  is  calculated  as  U  =  kuc,  where  uc  incorporates  the 
observed  difference  between  the  results  from  the  methods  and  their  respective  uncertainties,  and  uncertainty 
components related to moisture correction and to possible inhomogeneity, consistent with the ISO/JCGM Guide and 
with  its  Supplement  1,  and  k  is  a  coverage  factor  corresponding  to  approximately  95  %  confidence  [2–4].    The 
measurands are the mass fractions of genistin and glycitin in soy protein concentrate as determined by the methods 
indicated in this certificate.  The reference values are metrologically traceable to the SI unit of mass.
