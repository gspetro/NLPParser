Monoester Phthalates in Acetonitrile 

the  calibration  of  ch 

 
This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  use  in  the  calibration  of  chromatographic 
instrumentation.  A unit of SRM 3060 consists of five 2 mL ampoules, each containing approximately 1.2 mL of an 
acetonitrile solution of monoester phthalates. 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values:  The certified mass fraction values for monoester phthalates listed in Table 1 are 
based on results obtained from the gravimetric preparation of this solution and from the analytical results determined 
by  using  liquid  chromatography (LC) [1,2].    A  NIST  certified  value  is  a  value  for  which  NIST  has  the  highest 
confidence in its accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account.  
 
Reference Mass Fraction Values:  The reference mass fractions values for monoester phthalates listed in Table 2 are 
based on results obtained from the gravimetric preparation of the solution and from the analytical results determined 
by using liquid chromatography.  Reference values are values that are the best estimates of the true values; however, 
the values do not meet the NIST criteria for certification and are provided with associated uncertainties that may reflect 
only measurement precision, may not include all sources of uncertainty, or may reflect a lack of sufficient statistical 
agreement among multiple analytical methods [1]. 
 
Information Mass Fraction Value:  An information mass fraction value for monoester phthalates is listed in Table 3.  
An information value is considered to be a value that will be of interest and use to the SRM user, but insufficient 
information is available to assess the uncertainty associated with the value [1].  Information values cannot be used to 
establish metrological traceability. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 3060 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until  30 April 2026,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  given  in  this 
certificate  (see  “Instructions  for  Use”).    The  certification  is  nullified  if  the  SRM  is  damaged,  contaminated,  or 
otherwise modified.  
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
icate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Coordination  of  the  technical  measurements  leading  to  the  certification  on  this  SRM  was  under  the  direction  of 
J.R. Kucklick and J.L. Reiner of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division. 
 
Statistical consultation for this SRM was provided by J.H. Yen of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division. 
 
Analytical  measurements  were  performed  by  B.A. Benner Jr.,  A.S.P. Boggs,  J.R. Kucklick,  and  J.L. Reiner  of  the 
NIST Chemical Sciences Division.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 
 
Handling:  This material contains monoester phthalates, many of which have been reported to have toxic properties, 
and should be handled with care.  Use proper disposal methods.  Please refer to the Safety Data Sheet for additional 
health and safety information. 
 
Storage:  Sealed ampoules, as received, should be stored in the dark at temperatures lower than 30 °C. 
 
Opening of Ampoule:  Open ampoules carefully to prevent contamination and injury.  The ampoules are pre-scored 
and  should  NOT  be  opened  using  a  file.    Sample  aliquots  for  analysis  should  be  withdrawn  at  20 °C  to  25 °C 
immediately after opening the ampoules and should be processed without delay for the values in Tables 1 and 2 to be 
valid within the stated uncertainties.  Certified values are not applicable to material stored in ampoules that have been 
opened for more than 5 min, even if they are resealed. 
 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
SRM  Preparation:    The  monoester  phthalates  used  in  the  preparation  of  this  SRM  were  obtained  from  CanSyn 
then
Chemical  Corporation  (Toronto, Ontario,  Canada).    The  solution  was  prepared  at  NIST  by  weighing  and  then 
dissolving the individual monoester phthalates into acetonitrile.  The total mass of this solution was measured, and the 
mass fractions were determined for the components.  This bulk solution was then chilled to approximately –5 °C, and 
1.2 mL aliquots were dispensed into 2 mL amber glass ampoules that were then flame sealed.  
 
Liquid Chromatographic Analysis:  Aliquots from ampoules selected by a stratified random sampling were analyzed 
by  using 
tandem  mass  spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)  on  a  Betasil  Phenyl  column 
(150 mm x 2.1 mm  x  3.0 µm,  Thermo  Scientific,  Waltham, MA).    An  internal  standard  solution  containing 
13C-labeled  monoester  phthalates  was  added  to  each  sample  for  quantification  purposes.    Calibration  solutions 
consisting  of  weighed  amounts  of  the  monoester  phthalates  and  internal  standard  compounds  in  acetonitrile  were 
chromatographically analyzed to determine analyte response factors.  
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values:  Each certified value, is a mean of average mass fractions, with one average from 
gravimetric preparation and one average from chromatographic measurements.  The measurand is the mass fraction 
for each monoester phthalate listed in Table 1.  The uncertainty provided with each value is an expanded uncertainty 
about the mean to cover the measurand with approximately 95 % confidence.  The expanded uncertainty is calculated 
as  U = kuc,  where  the  combined  uncertainty  uc  incorporates  the  observed  difference  between  the  results  from  the 
methods and their respective uncertainties, consistently with the ISO/JCGM Guide and its Supplement 1, and k = 2 is 
a coverage factor corresponding to approximately 95 % confidence [3–5].  Metrological traceability is to the derived 
SI unit for mass fraction (expressed as milligrams per kilogram).

Reference Mass Fraction Values:  Each reference value is a mean of average mass fractions, with one average from 
gravimetric preparation and one average from chromatographic measurements.  The measurand is the mass fraction 
for each monoester phthalate listed in Table 2 as determined by the methods indicated.  The uncertainty provided with 
each value is an expanded uncertainty about the mean to cover the measurand with approximately 95 % confidence.  
The  expanded  uncertainty  is  calculated  as  U = kuc,  where  the  combined  uncertainty  uc  incorporates  the  observed 
difference between the results from the methods and their respective uncertainties, consistently with the ISO/JCGM 
Guide and its Supplement 1, and k = 2 is a coverage factor corresponding to approximately 95 % confidence [3–5].  
Metrological traceability is to the derived SI unit for mass fraction (expressed as milligrams per kilogram).
