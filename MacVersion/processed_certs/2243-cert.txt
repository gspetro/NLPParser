Relative Intensity Correction Standard for  
Raman Spectroscopy: 488 nm and 514.5 nm Excitation 

 
This  Standard  Reference  Material  (SRM)  is  a  certified  spectroscopic  standard  for  the  correction  of  the  relative 
intensity  of  Raman  spectra  obtained  with  instruments  employing  either  488  nm  or  514.5  nm  laser  excitation.  
SRM 2243 consists of an optical glass that emits a broadband luminescence spectrum when excited with either of 
these  two  laser  wavelengths.    The  relative  spectral  intensity  of  the  glass  luminescence,  for  each  excitation 
wavelength, has been determined through the use of a white-light, uniform-source, integrating sphere that has been 
calibrated  for  its  irradiance  at  NIST.    The  shape  of  the  luminescence  spectrum  of  this  glass  is  described  by  a 
polynomial expression that relates the relative spectral intensity to the wavenumber (cm–1) expressed as the Raman 
shift  from  the  excitation  laser  wavelength.    This  polynomial,  together  with  a  measurement  of  the  luminescence 
spectrum of the standard, can be used to determine the spectral intensity-response correction that is unique to each 
Raman system.  The resulting instrument-intensity-response correction may then be used to obtain Raman spectra 
that are instrument independent.  
 
This SRM is the third in a series of SRM’s (2241, 2242, 2243) that provide relative intensity correction for Raman 
spectrometers  employing  lasers  commonly  used  for  Raman  spectroscopy.    This  SRM  is  intended  for  use  in 
measurements over the range of 20 °C to 25 °C. 
 
Certification:    The  polynomials  describing  the  relative  luminescence  spectrum  of  SRM  2243  as  a  function  of 
excitation wavelength are given in Tables 1 and 2. 
 
Expiration  of  Certification:    The  certification  of  SRM  2243  is  valid  until  01  January  2014,  within  the 
measurement  uncertainties  specified,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and stored  in  accordance with  the  instructions 
given in this certificate (see “Instructions for Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is physically damaged, 
contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance  of  SRM  Certification:    NIST  will  monitor  this  SRM  over  the  period  of  its  certification.    If 
substantive changes occur that affect the certification before the expiration of this certificate, NIST will notify the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
Production and certification of this SRM were performed by S.J. Choquette, W.S. Hurst, and D.H. Blackburn of the 
NIST Chemical Science and Technology Laboratory.   
 
The SRM units were cut and polished by J. Fuller of the NIST Fabrication Technology Division. 
 
Statistical consultation was provided by S.D. Leigh and N.A. Heckert of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division. 
 
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Measurement  Services 
Division.

Certified Values:  A NIST certified value [1] represents a value derived from data reported in an SRM certificate 
for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy to the extent that all known or suspected sources of bias 
have been fully investigated or accounted for by NIST.  The certified values of the coefficients of the sixth-order 
polynomial describing the shape of the luminescence spectrum of SRM 2243, excited at 488 nm (20 492.35 cm–1), 
are 
its  associated  expanded  uncertainty  [3]  (relative  ±  2σ 
confidence curves (CC)) are shown in Figures 1 and 2.  The dependent variable of this polynomial expression is the 
relative  spectral  intensity  of  the  luminescence.    The  independent  variable  of  this  polynomial  is  the  wavenumber 
expressed in units of Raman shift (cm–1) from the laser excitation wavelength of 20 492.35 cm–1.  This polynomial is 
certified to describe the luminescent response of the SRM when it is measured between the temperatures of 20 °C to 
25 °C.  This polynomial certifies the shape of the luminescence spectrum between 200 cm–1 and 4800 cm–1 Raman 
shift for excitation of this SRM with a 488 nm laser.   
 
The  certified  values  of  the  coefficients  of  the  sixth-order  polynomial  describing  the  shape  of  the  luminescence 
spectrum of SRM 2243, excited at 514.5 nm (19 435.18 cm–1), are listed in Table 2.  The spectrum and its associated 
expanded  uncertainty  [3]  (relative  ±  2σ  confidence  curves  (CC))  are  shown  in  Figures  3  and  4.    The  dependent 
variable  of  this  polynomial  expression  is  the  relative  spectral  intensity  of  the  luminescence.    The  independent 
variable  of  this  polynomial  is  the  wavenumber  expressed  in  units  of Raman  shift  (cm–1)  from  the  laser  excitation 
wavelength of 19 435.18 cm–1.  This polynomial is certified to describe the luminescent response of the SRM when 
it is measured between the temperatures of 20 °C to 25 °C.  This polynomial certifies the shape of the luminescence 
spectrum between 200 cm–1 and 4800 cm–1 Raman shift for excitation of this SRM with a 514.5 nm laser. 
 
Certification  Uncertainty:  The  coefficients  of  the  polynomials  that  express  the  expanded  uncertainty 
(the relative ± 2σ confidence  curves)  of  the  certified  polynomial  of  ISRM(Δυ)  are  listed  in  Tables  1  and  2.    The 
relative  ± 2σ  Confidence  Curves(Δυ)  are  calculated  as  ± 2σ  Confidence  Curve(Δυ)  /  ISRM(Δυ).    To  calculate  the 
upper and lower 95 % confidence curves for the luminescence spectrum of SRM 2243, use the formula: 
 
 
 
The relative ± 2σ confidence curves, as calculated from the coefficients of Tables 1 and 2, are shown in Figures 2 
and 4.  The calculated upper and lower 95 % CC are shown in Figures 1 and 3. 
 
The  confidence  curves  were  calculated  by  applying  the  point-by-point  uncertainty  analysis  of  [2]  to  the  fitted 
polynomial.    This  method  was  used  to  evaluate  the  uncertainties  of  the  shape  of  the  luminescence  spectrum  of 
SRM 2243  based  on  measurements  using  three  different  instruments.    Components  of  the  uncertainty  include  the 
uncertainty in the white-light, uniform-source, integrating sphere irradiance calibration and various systematic errors 
from the operation of the Raman instruments used in the measurements.  Careful measurements of the glass have 
shown  it  to  be  spatially  homogeneous  in  spectral  luminescence.    No  significant  changes  in  the  shape  of  the 
luminescence spectrum occur over the range of laser power densities commonly used in Raman instruments.    
 
Physical Description:  SRM 2243 is a manganese-doped (0.15 wt % MnO2) borate matrix glass.  Each unit of this 
SRM consists of a glass slide that is approximately 10.7 mm in width × 30.4 mm in length × 2.0 mm in thickness, 
with one surface optically polished and the opposite surface ground to a frosted finish using a 400 grit polish.  The 
frosted  surface  of  the  slide  is  characterized  by  a  surface  average  roughness  (root-mean-square)  in  the  range  of 
1.30 μm to 1.49 μm, as determined by stylus profilometry [4].  The slide is held in a 12.5 mm square cuvette-style 
optical  mount.    This  mount  is  designed  for  the  typical  12.5  mm  sampling  accessories  widely  used  in  chemical 
spectroscopy,  i.e.,  absorbance,  fluorescence,  etc.    This  mount  can  easily  be  placed  on  its  side  for  use  on  a 
microscope stage.  The mount holds the glass slide, frosted side up, in place with a clip.  The glass slide extends 
approximately 0.3 mm above the sides of the mount to allow its use with close focus objectives.   
 
Measurement Conditions:  The certification measurements of the luminescence spectrum of SRM 2243 were made 
using  three  Raman  spectrometers.    One  was  a  commercial  Raman  microscopy  system,  while  the  other  two  used 
commercial 0.5 m focal length spectrometers designed for array detectors. Each had its own dedicated, line-tuneable 
argon ion laser.   All Raman systems were operated in a 180° backscattering geometry.  The collection optics ranged 
from short focus objective lenses (microscope system) to an achromatic 200 mm focal length collection lens.  The 
x-axis  of  each  spectrometer  was  calibrated  for  wavelength  using  a  neon  emission  pen  lamp.    The  y-axis  (relative 
spectral intensity) of each system was calibrated with a white-light, uniform-source, integrating sphere that had been 
calibrated for irradiance at NIST.  The spectral resolution of the systems ranged from approximately 3 cm–1 to 6 cm–
1 as measured by the full-width-at-half-maximum of the neon emission lines.  All certification data were acquired at 
nominal room temperature (21°C  ±  1°C ).

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE  
 
SRM  2243  is  used  to  provide  Raman  spectra  corrected  for  relative  intensity.    This  requires  a  measurement  of  its 
luminescence  spectrum  on  the  Raman  instrument  and  then  a  mathematical  treatment  of  both  this  observed 
luminescence spectrum and the observed Raman spectrum of the sample.   
 
For  proper  use  of  this  procedure,  attention  must  be  paid  to  the  following  experimental  conditions.    Due  to 
polarization effects that are present in Raman instrumentation, a polarization scrambler should be employed in the 
Raman  light-collection  optics,  most  preferably  in  a  region  of  collimated  light.    Raman  spectral  bands  that  exhibit 
various degrees of polarization will not be properly intensity-corrected without the use of a scrambler.  To acquire 
the luminescence spectrum of SRM 2243, the surface of the glass should be placed at the same position from which 
the  Raman  spectrum  of  the  sample  is  collected.    It  is  important  that  the  laser  excitation  be  incident  only  on  the 
frosted surface of the glass.  The shape of the spectral luminescence will have some sensitivity to the placement of 
the  glass  surface  relative  to  the  collection  optics  of  the  spectrometer,  which  is  minimized  by  scattering  from  the 
frosted surface.  Measurement conditions should be arranged to furnish a spectrum of optimum signal-to-noise ratio.  
The luminescence spectrum should be acquired over the same Raman range as that of the sample. 
 
The relative intensity of the measured Raman spectrum of the sample can be corrected for the instrument-specific 
response  by  a  computational  procedure  that  uses  a  correction  curve.    This  curve  is  generated  using  the  certified 
polynomial  and  the  measured  luminescence  spectrum  of  the  SRM  glass.    For  the  spectral  range  of  certification, 
Δυ  =   200  cm–1  to  4800 cm–1,  compute  the  elements  of  the  certified  relative  spectral  intensity  of  SRM  2243, 
ISRM(Δυ), according to equation 1: 
  
 
 
where (Δυ) is the wavenumber in units of Raman shift (cm–1) and the An’s are the coefficients listed in Tables 1 or 2.  
The  elements  of  ISRM(Δυ)  are  obtained  by  evaluating  equation  1  at  the  same  data  point  spacing  used  for  the 
acquisition of the luminescence spectrum of the SRM and of the Raman spectrum of the sample.  ISRM(Δυ) has been 
normalized to unity and is a relative unit expressed in terms of photons sec–1cm–2(cm–1)–1, or alternatively:  

ISRM(Δυ)  =  A0  +  A1    (Δυ)1  +  A2  ×  (Δυ)2  +  A3  ×  (Δυ)3  +  A4  ×  (Δυ)4  +  A5  ×  (Δυ)5 + A6 ×  (Δυ)6

(2) 

ICORR(Δυ)  =  ISRM(Δυ) / SSRM(Δυ). 

SCORR(Δυ)  =  SMEAS(Δυ)  ×  ICORR(Δυ) 

The data sets that are the measured glass luminescence spectrum, SSRM, and the measured Raman spectrum of the 
sample, SMEAS, must have the units of Raman shift (cm–1).  The elements of the correction curve ICORR(Δυ), defined 
by equation 2, are obtained from ISRM(Δυ) and the elements of the glass luminescence spectrum, SSRM(Δυ) according 
to equation 2: 
 
 
The elements of the intensity-corrected Raman spectrum, SCORR(Δυ), are derived by multiplication of the elements of 
the  measured  Raman  spectrum  of  the  sample,  SMEAS(Δυ),  by  the  elements  of  the  correction  curve  according  to 
equation 3: 
 
 
In  measurements  with  a  dispersive  spectrometer,  the  x-axis  is  directly  related  to  the  wavelength  (nm)  of  the 
measured spectrum.  The transformation from the wavelength scale to the Raman shift scale requires a multiplicative 
factor  of  λ2  be  applied  to  the  relative  intensity.    The  certified  relative  spectral  intensity  polynomial,  ISRM(Δυ), 
includes  this  λ2 factor.    As  a  result  of  equations 1  through  3,  the  elements  SMEAS(Δυ)  and  SSRM(Δυ)  may  either 
include this λ2 factor or not, so long as it is consistently applied, since it will cancel out if it is included.  A detailed 
description of this procedure for the intensity correction of Raman spectra can be found in references 5 and 6. 
 
The polynomial expression, equation 1, is certified for use between 200 cm–1 and 4800 cm–1.  This is the spectral 
range  common  to  the  three  instruments  used  for  the  certification.    The  polynomial  fits  are  intended  as  simple 
numerical  descriptors  of  the  spectral  response  observed  over  the  wavenumber  range  studied.    They  are  NOT 
intended for use in extrapolation; in fact, such use is strongly discouraged.  Nor are these fits intended as physically 
meaningful  models.    Additional  studies  have  measured  the  luminescence  of  SRM  2243  from  –1000  cm–1  and 
7000 cm–1 Raman shift from the respective laser excitation wavelength.  The relative intensity corrected spectra of 
SRM 2243 for the extended range is shown in Figure 5.  This figure is provided for information purposes only.   
The  polynomial  coefficients  listed  in  Tables  1  or  2  can  not  be  used  to  extrapolate  the  certification  to  this 
extended range without incurring significant error.  Extrapolation of the polynomial outside the certification 
limits of 200 cm–1 and 4800 cm–1 is not a supported use of this SRM.

If  additional  information  regarding  the  extended  luminescence  of  this  SRM  is  desired,  please  contact  NIST  [7].  
Certified values of the polynomial coefficients given in Tables 1 or 2 are for use at temperatures between 20 °C to 
25 °C.   
 
Use of this SRM at temperatures other than the certification temperature is not currently supported.  However, the 
temperature response of this SRM has been studied between the ranges of 5 °C and 60 °C.  Unlike previous SRM’s 
in this series, the white light corrected and normalized luminescence spectra of SRM 2243 does not demonstrate a 
temperature dependence. 
 
This SRM is not intended for use as a standard for the determination of absolute spectral irradiance or radiance. 
 
Handling and Storage:  To maintain the certified properties of SRM 2243, the glass slide should be handled only in 
its mount.  When not in use, the SRM should be stored in the container provided or in one providing comparable 
mechanical protection.  
 
Luminescence  Spectrum on  the  Wavelength Scale:    The  equation  describing  the  luminescence  spectrum  of  the 
glass SRM is given in equation 1, where (Δυ) is the wavenumber in units of Raman shift (cm–1).  For correction of 
spectra where the x-axis is in wavelength with units of nanometers, the same polynomial coefficients can be used to 
calculate ISRM(λ) through the following coordinate transformation: 
 
 
 
where: 

ISRM(λ) = [107/λ2]  ×  [A0  +  A1  ×  Z1  +  A2  ×  Z2  +  A3  ×  Z3  +  A4  ×  Z4  +  A5  ×  Z5 + A6 ×  Z6 ] 

(6) 

 

Z = 107  ×  [(1.0/λL)  –  (1.0/λ)] 

(7) 

  
and λL is the wavelength of the laser in nm and λ is the wavelength in nanometers.  The factor of 107 in the first term 
of equation 6 is needed only if it is desired to preserve the numerical value of spectral areas computed relative to the 
two x-axis coordinate systems.
