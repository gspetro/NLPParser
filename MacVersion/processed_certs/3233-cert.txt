Certificate of Analysis 
 
Standard Reference Material 3233 
 
Fortified Breakfast Cereal 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended primarily for validation of methods for determining proximates, 
sugars, dietary fiber, vitamins, elements, and amino acids in fortified breakfast cereals and similar materials.  This 
SRM can also be used for quality assurance when assigning values to in-house reference materials.  The SRM is a 
wheat-based fortified breakfast cereal prepared by a commercial manufacturer.  A unit of SRM 3233 consists of one 
bottle containing approximately 60 g of material and sealed inside an aluminized pouch. 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values:  Certified mass fraction values for elements and vitamins in SRM 3233, reported 
on a dry-mass basis, are provided in Tables 1 and 2.  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest 
confidence  in  its  accuracy  in  that  all  known  or  suspected  sources  of  bias  have  been  investigated  or  taken  into 
account [1].  Analyses for value assignment were performed by NIST and collaborating laboratories.  Certified values 
were  calculated  as  the  mean  of  the  mean  values  from  NIST  methods,  the  mean  values  from  U.S.  Department  of 
Agriculture (USDA)  methods,  and  the  median  of  the  mean  results  provided  by  collaborating  laboratories,  where 
appropriate.  All values were combined without weighting.  The associated uncertainties are expressed at the 95 % 
level of confidence [2–4]. 
 
Reference Mass Fraction Values:  Reference mass fraction values for additional elements and vitamins, proximates, 
sugars, calories, dietary fiber, and amino acids in SRM 3233, reported on a dry-mass basis, are provided in Tables 3 
through 7.  A NIST reference value is a noncertified value that is the best estimate of the true value based on available 
data; however, the value does not meet the NIST criteria for certification [1] and is provided with an uncertainty that 
may reflect only measurement reproducibility, may not include all sources of uncertainty, or may reflect a lack of 
sufficient statistical agreement among multiple analytical methods.  The reference mass fraction values were derived 
from results reported by NIST and/or collaborating laboratories. 
 
Information  Mass  Fraction  Values:    Information  mass  fraction  values  for  additional  elements  and  dietary  fiber, 
reported on a dry-mass basis, are provided in Tables 8 and 9 to help characterize the composition of the material.  A 
‘A 
railable  to 
NIST information value is a value that may be of interest to the SRM user, but insufficient information is available to 
assess the uncertainty associated with the value and therefore no uncertainty is provided.  Values are reported on a 
dry-mass basis in mass fraction units [5].  Information values cannot be used to establish metrological traceability. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 3233 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until  20 June 2027,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  given  in  this 
certificate (see “Instructions for Storage and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, 
or otherwise modified.

Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Coordination of the technical measurements leading to the certification of this SRM was performed by M.M. Phillips 
and L.J. Wood of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division, K.E. Sharpless of the NIST Special Programs Office, and 
S. Ehling of the Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA, Washington, DC).

NOTICE AND WARNING TO USERS 
 
SRM 3233 IS INTENDED FOR RESEARCH USE, NOT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE AND USE 
 
Storage:  The SRM should be stored at controlled room temperature (20 °C to 25 °C) in the original unopened bottles.  
For elemental analyses, the bottle can be recapped and test portions removed and analyzed until the material reaches 
its expiration date.  Water-soluble vitamins are stable in previously opened and tightly recapped bottles for at least 
one year when stored at room temperature or under refrigeration (4 °C).  For analyses of remaining analytes, the bottle 
can be recapped and test portions removed and analyzed for three months after the bottle was first opened. 
 
Use:  Before use, the contents of the bottle should be mixed thoroughly by rotating and/or rolling.  Allow the contents 
to settle for one minute prior to opening to minimize the loss of fine particles.  For certified values to be valid, test 
portion size should be based on descriptions below (See “Source, Preparation, and Analysis”).  Test portions should 
be analyzed as-received and results converted to a dry-mass basis by determining moisture content (using one of the 
methods  described  below)  on  a  separate  test  portion.    Results  obtained  should  include  their  own  estimates  of 
uncertainty and can be compared to the certified values using procedures described in reference 6. 
 
Determination of Moisture:  The moisture content of SRM 3233 was determined at NIST by (1) freeze-drying to 
constant mass over 7 d; (2) drying over magnesium perchlorate in a desiccator at room temperature for 28 d; and (3) 
drying for 2 h in a forced-air oven at 80 °C.  Unweighted results obtained using all three techniques were averaged to 
determine a conversion factor of (0.983 ± 0.007) gram dry-mass per gram as-received mass, which was used to convert 
data from an as-received to a dry-mass basis; the uncertainty shown on this value is an expanded uncertainty (k = 2) 
to represent a 95 % level of confidence.  An uncertainty component for the conversion factor (0.36 %) obtained from 
the moisture measurements is incorporated in the uncertainties of the certified and reference values, reported on a 
dry-mass basis, that are provided in this certificate. 
 
SOURCE, PREPARATION, AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Source and Preparation:  The SRM is a fortified breakfast cereal.  Two hundred kilograms (440 lbs) of fortified 
breakfast  cereal  was  received  as  flakes  in  a  single  large  box.    The  contents  of  the  box  were  ground  to  180 μm 
(80 mesh), blended, and bottled by High-Purity Standards (Charleston, SC).  The cereal powder was placed in 4 oz 
amber bottles that had been flushed  with  nitrogen.  Each bottle contains 60 g of cereal powder.  The bottles  were 
capped  and  sealed  with  heat-shrink  tape,  then  individually  sealed  in  aluminized  Mylar  bags.    Following  bottling, 
SRM 3233 was irradiated by Neutron Products, Inc. (Dickerson, MD) to an absorbed dose of 9.0 kGy to 11.5 kGy. 
 

                                                           
 

( 1 ) Certain  commercial  equipment,  instruments  or  materials  are  identified  in  this  certificate  to  adequately  specify  the 
experimental procedure.  Such identification does not imply recommendation or endorsement by the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the purpose.

Analytical  Approach  for  Determination  of  Elements:    Value  assignment  of  the  mass  fractions  of  elements  in 
SRM 3233 was based on the combination of measurements from two different analytical methods at NIST and data 
from collaborating laboratories, where available.  NIST provided measurements by using inductively coupled plasma 
optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), isotope dilution 
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ID ICP-MS), instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA), and 
radiochemical neutron activation analysis (RNAA). 
 
NIST Analyses for Ba, Ca, Co, Cu, Fe, I, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, P, Sr, V, and Zn Using ICP-OES and/or ICP-MS:  Mass 
fractions of barium, calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, strontium, and 
zinc  were  measured  by  ICP-OES  using  duplicate  0.5 g  test  portions  taken  from  each  of  10 bottles  of  SRM 3233.  
Samples for ICP-OES were digested in a nitric acid/hydrofluoric acid mixture using a microwave sample preparation 
system.    Mass  fractions  of  barium,  cobalt,  molybdenum,  strontium,  and  vanadium  were  measured  by  ICP-MS  in 
duplicate 0.25 g test portions taken from each of 10 bottles.  Samples were digested in nitric acid using a microwave 
sample preparation system.  The mass fraction of iodine was measured by ICP-MS in single 0.3 g test portions taken 
from each of six bottles.  Samples  were digested in aqueous tetramethylammonium hydroxide using a  microwave 
sample preparation system.  Quantification for all elements  measured by ICP-OES and ICP-MS  was based on the 
method of standard additions using SRM 3100 series single element standard solutions. 
 
NIST Analysis for Cd Using ID ICP-MS:  The mass fraction of cadmium was measured by ID ICP-MS using duplicate 
0.5 g test portions taken from each of six bottles of SRM 3233.  Samples were spiked with 111Cd and were digested in 
nitric  acid  using  a  microwave  sample  preparation  system.    To  remove  spectral  interferences  in  the  cadmium 
determination, the sample digests were evaporated to dryness and reconstituted in water and concentrated hydrochloric 
acid  to  convert  the  nitrate  form  to  the  chloride.    Samples  were  evaporated  to  dryness  and  again  reconstituted  in 
concentrated hydrochloric acid, which was again evaporated.  Salts were dissolved in hydrochloric and hydrofluoric 
acids and loaded onto an anion exchange resin.  Interferents were eluted using hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acids.  
The cadmium-containing fraction was eluted using nitric acid.  This fraction was evaporated to dryness and redissolved 
in nitric acid prior to analysis.  Quantification for ID ICP-MS was based on calibration by reverse isotope dilution 
ICP-MS using primary standards prepared from high-purity Cd metals as well as SRM 3108 Cadmium (Cd) Standard 
Solution. 
 
NIST Analysis for As Using RNAA:  The mass fraction of arsenic was measured by RNAA using single 0.25 g test 
portions taken from each of six bottles of SRM 3233.  Individual disks were formed from the test portions using a 
stainless steel die and hydraulic press.  Samples were packaged individually in clean polyethylene bags and irradiated 
in  one  polyethylene  irradiation  vessel  for  5 h  at  20 MW,  which  provided  a  thermal  neutron  fluence  rate  of  
3 × 1013 cm–2s–1.  Samples were combined with 77As prior to chemical separation, then dissolved in a mixture of nitric 
and perchloric acids, and arsenic separated from the matrix as described in reference 7.  The 559 keV line from decay 
of  76As  was used for quantification.  The 239 keV line from decay of  77As  was evaluated for yield determination.  
Quantification for RNAA was based on solutions made using SRM 3103a Arsenic (As) Standard Solution.

NIST Analyses for Al, Cl, Fe, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, V, and Zn Using INAA:  Mass fractions of aluminum, chlorine, iron, 
magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, sodium, vanadium, and zinc were measured by INAA using duplicate 0.225 g 
test portions taken from each of six bottles of SRM 3233.  Powders were pressed into cylindrical pellets, and samples, 
standards, and controls were packaged individually in clean polyethylene bags and irradiated individually at 20 MW.  
For  analysis  of  the  short-lived  nuclides  (aluminum,  chlorine,  magnesium,  manganese,  sodium,  and  vanadium)  by 
INAA, the packages were irradiated with one flux monitor foil for 60 s at a reactor power of 20 MW.  The count was 
done after a 5 min decay at a sample-to-detector distance of 14 cm for a 5 min counting time.  For the analysis of iron, 
molybdenum, and zinc by INAA, samples, standards, and controls were irradiated for 4 h; irradiation capsules were 
then inverted 180 degrees, and materials were irradiated another 4 h.  Molybdenum was counted for 8 h after a decay 
of more than 168 h.  Cobalt, iron, and zinc were counted for 8 h after a decay of more than 120 days.  Quantification 
for INAA was based on solutions made using SRM 3100 series single element standard solutions. 
 
Analytical  Approach  for  Determination  of  Vitamins:    Value  assignment  of  the  mass  fractions  of  vitamins  in 
SRM 3233 was based on the combination of measurements from various analytical methods at NIST, USDA, and 
collaborating laboratories, where available.  NIST provided measurements by using liquid chromatography (LC) with 
mass spectrometry (MS) and absorbance detection, as well as by using isotope dilution (ID) LC with MS or tandem 
mass spectrometry (MS/MS) detection. 
 
NIST Analysis for α-Tocopheryl Acetate Using LC-MS:  The mass fraction of α-tocopheryl acetate was measured in 
duplicate 10 g test portions taken  from each of 12 bottles of SRM 3233.  Ethanolic tocol was added as an internal 
standard.  The analyte and internal standard were extracted from the sample into hexane by rotational agitation for 
60 min.    The  samples  were  centrifuged,  the  supernatants  were  decanted,  and  an  additional  aliquot  of  hexane  was 
added.  Samples were extracted further by 60 min of rotational agitation.  An additional cycle of rotational agitation 

SRM 3233 

Page 3 of 10 

was conducted, for a total of three extractions.  Three additional extractions were performed using sonication in ethyl 
acetate followed by 60 min of rotational agitation.  The pooled organic layers were evaporated to approximately 25 mL 
under nitrogen, washed with water, evaporated to dryness under nitrogen, and resuspended in ethanol for analysis by 
LC-MS.  Separations were performed on a C18 column with an isocratic mobile phase of 60 % methanol and 40 % 
acetonitrile  (volume  fractions)  containing  5 mmol/L  ammonium  acetate.    Tocol  and  α-tocopheryl  acetate  were 
monitored  at  m/z 388  and  m/z 473,  respectively.    Calibrants  were  prepared  gravimetrically,  at  levels  intended  to 
approximate the level of α-tocopheryl acetate in the SRM following extraction.  The purity of the α-tocopheryl acetate 
calibrant  material  was  determined  at  NIST  using  spectrophotometry  at  284 nm  (molar  extinction  coefficient  of  
43.6 dL·g-1cm-1) in combination with LC-absorbance at 284 nm.  A single internal standard solution was used for the 
calibrants and samples. 
 
NIST Analysis for Ascorbic Acid Using LC-Absorbance:  The mass fraction of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) was measured 
in duplicate 2 g test portions taken from each of 10 bottles of SRM 3233.  4-pyridoxic acid was added as an internal 
standard, metaphosphoric acid was added to stabilize the vitamin C in solution, and dithiothreitol was added to convert 
dihydroascorbic acid to total ascorbic acid.  The analyte and internal standard were extracted from the sample into 
30 g  to  35 g  of  HPLC-grade  water  by  sonication  for  30 min.    Following  centrifugation,  a  1 mL  test  portion  was 
removed and filtered using a 0.45 µm nylon filter for analysis by LC-absorbance.  Separations were performed on a 
C18 column with a gradient mobile phase of potassium phosphate (dibasic) and acetonitrile and absorbance detection 
at 243 nm.  The purity of the neat calibrant material was determined at NIST using LC-absorbance at 243 nm.  A single 
internal standard solution was used for the calibrants and samples. 
 
NIST Analyses for Thiamine, Niacinamide, Niacin, and Pantothenic Acid Using ID-LC-MS:  The mass fractions of 
thiamine, niacinamide, niacin, and pantothenic acid were measured in duplicate 0.5 g test portions taken from each of 
12 bottles of SRM 3233.  Four internal standards were added:  13C3-thiamine chloride; 2H4-niacinamide; 2H4-niacin; 
and  calcium  13C3,15N-pantothenate.    The  analytes  and  internal  standards  were  extracted  into  dilute  acetic  acid  by 
sonication  for  30 min.    Following  centrifugation,  a  1 mL  test  portion  was  removed  and  filtered  using  a  0.45 µm 
regenerated  cellulose  filter  for  analysis  by  positive-ion  mode  ID-LC-MS.    Separations  were  performed  on  a 
C18 column with a gradient mobile phase of ammonium formate buffer and methanol.  Thiamine and 13C3-thiamine 
were measured at m/z 265 and m/z 268, respectively.  Niacinamide and 2H4-niacinamide were measured at m/z 123 and 
m/z 127, respectively.  Niacin and 2H4-niacin were measured at m/z 124 and m/z 128, respectively.  Pantothenic acid 
and  13C3,15N-pantothenic  acid  were  measured  at  m/z 220  and  m/z 224,  respectively.    The  purity  of  neat  calibrant 
materials  was  determined  at  NIST  using  LC-absorbance,  Karl  Fischer  titration,  thermogravimetric  analysis,  and 
differential scanning calorimetry.  A single internal standard solution was used for the calibrants and samples. 
 
NIST Analysis for Folic Acid Using ID-LC-MS/MS:  The mass fraction of folic acid was measured in duplicate 1.0 g 
test portions taken from each of 12 bottles of SRM 3233.   13C5-folic acid  was added as an internal standard.  The 
by  vortex  mixing, 
analyte and internal standard were extracted into a sodium phosphate buffer containing ascorbic acid by vortex mixing, 
filtered
gentle shaking at 37 °C for 2 h, and boiling for 15 min.  Extracts were then cooled on ice and a test portion filtered 
through  a  0.45 µm  polyvinylidene  difluoride  (PVDF)  filter  for  analysis  by  positive-ion  mode  ID-LC-MS/MS.  
Separations  were  performed  on  a  C18 column  with  a  gradient  mobile  phase  of  water  and  acetonitrile  containing  
formic  acid.    Folic  acid  and  13C5-folic  acid  were  monitored  at  the  transitions  m/z 442.4 → m/z 295.1  and 
m/z 447.4 → m/z 295.1, respectively. 
 
USDA Analyses for Water-Soluble Vitamins:  Mass fractions of thiamine, niacinamide, pantothenic acid, and folic 
acid  were  measured  by  using  ID-LC-MS.    Mass  fractions  of  thiamine  and  niacinamide  were  measured  using 
hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) with ID-MS.  Mass fractions of thiamine, niacinamide, pantothenic 
acid,  and  folic  acid  were  measured  in  separate  samples  using  ultra  performance  liquid  chromatography (UPLC) 
methods with ID-MS.  Results from the methods were similar and were therefore considered as a single data set, with 
the uncertainty as the standard error of the mean. 
 
Collaborating Laboratories’ Analyses:  The GMA FIACC laboratories were asked to use their usual methods to 
make single measurements of proximates, calories, vitamins, elements, and amino acids on test portions taken from 
each of two bottles of SRM 3233.  In a second exercise, a subset of these laboratories measured sugars in each of two 
bottles.  In a third exercise, several GMA laboratories and one other laboratory measured dietary fiber in each of six 
bottles using four AOAC Official Methods of Analysis:  985.29 Total Dietary Fiber in Foods (Enzymatic-Gravimetric 
Method); 991.42 Insoluble Dietary Fiber in Foods and Food Products (Enzymatic-Gravimetric Method, Phosphate 
Buffer);  2009.01  Total  Dietary  Fiber  in  Foods  (Enzymatic-Gravimetric-Liquid  Chromatographic  Method);  and 
2011.25 Insoluble, Soluble, and Total Dietary Fiber in Foods (Enzymatic-Gravimetric-Liquid Chromatography) [8].

Homogeneity Assessment:  The homogeneity of vitamins and elements was assessed at NIST using the methods and 
test portion sizes described above.  Analysis of the variance showed statistically significant heterogeneity for cobalt 
and  molybdenum,  and  the  uncertainties  for  these  values  incorporate  an  additional  component  for  possible 
heterogeneity.  Homogeneity of constituents measured solely by collaborating laboratories (e.g., proximates, amino 
acids) was not assessed, although the data were treated as though these analytes were homogeneously distributed. 
 
Value Assignment:  For calculation of assigned values for analytes that were measured only by NIST, the mean of 
the mean values from NIST results was used.  The collaborating laboratories reported the individual results for each 
of their analyses for a given analyte.  The mean of each laboratory’s results was then determined.  For calculation of 
assigned values for analytes that were measured only by the collaborating laboratories, the median of the laboratory 
means was used.  For analytes that were also measured by NIST, the mean of the individual sets of NIST data were 
averaged  with  the  mean  of  USDA  means  and  the  median  of  the  individual  GMA  FIACC  laboratory  means,  as 
appropriate. 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values for Elements:  Each certified mass fraction value is the combined mean from the 
means of results from analyses by NIST and the median of the means of results provided by collaborating laboratories, 
where available.  The uncertainty provided with each value is an expanded uncertainty about the mean to cover the 
measurand  with  approximately  95 %  confidence.    The  expanded  uncertainty  is  calculated  as  U = kuc,  where  uc 
incorporates the observed difference between the results from the methods and their respective uncertainties and an 
uncertainty component for moisture correction, consistent with the ISO/JCGM Guide and with its Supplement 1, and 
k is a coverage factor corresponding to approximately 95 % confidence [2–4].  The measurand is the total mass fraction 
for each element listed in Table 1 on a dry-mass basis.  Metrological traceability is to the SI derived unit for mass 
fraction (expressed as milligrams per kilogram).

Reference Mass Fraction Values for Elements:  Each reference  mass fraction value is the  mean result of NIST 
analyses using one or two methods.  The uncertainty provided is an expanded uncertainty about the mean to cover the 
measurand  with  approximately  95 %  confidence.    The  expanded  uncertainty  is  calculated  as  U = kuc,  where  uc 
represents  the  combined  uncertainty  consistent  with  the  ISO/JCGM  Guide  and  with  its  Supplement  1,  and  k  is  a 
coverage factor corresponding to approximately 95 % confidence [2-4].  The uncertainties for cobalt and molybdenum 
also incorporate an additional uncertainty component for possible inhomogeneity.  The measurand is the mass fraction 
for  each  element  listed  in  Table 3,  on  a  dry-mass  basis,  as  determined  by  the  method  indicated.    Metrological 
traceability  is  to  the  SI  derived  unit  for  mass  fraction  (expressed  as  milligrams per kilogram),  as  realized  by  the 
methods used.

Reference Mass Fraction Values for Selected Vitamins:  Each reference mass fraction value is the mean result of 
NIST analyses using a single method or the mean from the combination of NIST results with the median of the mean 
results provided by collaborating laboratories, where available.  The uncertainty provided is an expanded uncertainty 
about the mean to cover the measurand with approximately 95 % confidence.  The expanded uncertainty is calculated 
as  U = kuc,  where  uc  represents  the  combined  uncertainty  consistent  with  the  ISO/JCGM  Guide  and  with  its 
Supplement 1, and k is a coverage factor corresponding to approximately 95 % confidence [2-4].  The measurand is 
the  mass  fraction  for  each  vitamin  listed  in  Table 4, on  a dry-mass  basis,  as  determined  by  the  method  indicated.  
Metrological traceability is to mass fraction (expressed as milligrams per kilogram), as realized by the methods used.
