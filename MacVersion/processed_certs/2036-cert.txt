Near-Infrared Wavelength/Wavenumber Reflection Standard 

  SRM 2036 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is a certified transfer standard intended for the verification and calibration 
of  wavelength (λ)  and  wavenumber (ν)  scale  near-infrared (NIR)  spectrometers  operating  in  diffuse  reflectance 
mode. 
is  a  combination  of  a  glass  physically  contacted  with  a  piece  of  sintered 
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE).    The  combination  of  rare  earth  oxide  glass  with  a  nearly  ideal  diffuse  reflector 
provides reflection-absorption bands that range from 15 % reflectance (R) to 40 % R.  SRM 2036 is certified for the 
10 % band fraction centroid of seven bands spanning the spectral region from 975 nm to 1946 nm (air wavelength).  
In addition, it is certified for the 10 % band fraction centroid location of the same seven bands in the spectral region 
from 10 300 cm–1 to 5 130 cm–1 at 8 cm–1  resolution (vacuum wavenumber).  A unit of SRM 2036 consists of the 
optical filter-PTFE assembly mounted in an optical holder, contained in a wooden box. 
 
The  glass  is  a  mixture  of  the  following  mole  fractions:    3.00 %  holmium  oxide (Ho2O3),  1.30 %  samarium 
oxide (Sm2O3),  0.68 %  ytterbium  oxide (Yb2O3),  and  0.47 %  neodymium  oxide (Nd2O3)  in  a  matrix  containing 
lanthanum oxide (La2O3), boron oxide (B2O3), silicon oxide (SiO2), and zirconium oxide (ZrO2).  The optical filter is 
25 mm in diameter and 1.5 mm thick.  The sintered PTFE is 25 mm in diameter and approximately 6 mm thick. 
 
Certified Band Locations:  The certified vacuum-wavenumber locations for the seven reflection-absorption bands 
spanning  the  range  from  10 300 cm−1  to  5 130 cm−1  are  listed  in  Table 1.    The  certified  values  for  the  NIR 
air-wavelength  band  locations  for  the  seven  reflection-absorption  bands  from  976 nm  to  1946 nm  are  listed  in 
Table 2.    A  NIST  certified  value  is  a  value  for  which  NIST  has  the  highest  confidence  in  its  accuracy  in  that  all 
known or suspected sources of bias have been fully investigated or taken into account [1]. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 2036 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until 30 November 2022, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given in this 
certificate (see “Instructions for Handling, Storage, and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, 
contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance  of  SRM  Certification:    NIST  will  monitor  this  SRM  over  the  period  of  its  certification.    If 
substantive  technical  changes  occur  that affect  the  certification before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST will 
notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
Overall  direction  and  coordination  of  the  technical  measurements  leading  to  the  certification  of  this  SRM  were 
provided by S.J. Choquette of the NIST Biosystems and Biomaterials Division. 
 
The production and certification of SRM 2036 was conducted by S.J. Choquette with assistance from A. Gaigalas 
and A. Urbas of the NIST Biosystems and Biomaterials Division. 
 
The SRM filter glass was cut and polished by J. Fuller of the NIST Fabrication Technology Division. 
 
Statistical consultation was provided by S. Leigh of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division. 
 
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Office  of  Reference 
Materials.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
Handling:  To maintain the integrity of SRM 2036, the filter should only be handled in its optical mount. 
 
Storage:    While  not  in  use,  the  SRM  should  be  stored  in  the  container  provided  or  one  with  similar  or  better 
mechanical protection. 
 
Use:    SRM 2036  is  intended  for  the  calibration  of  diffuse  reflectance  spectrometers.    The  method  of  use  for 
SRM 2036  will  vary  with  the  type  of  accessory.    Generally,  the  reference  spectrum  may  be  obtained  from  the 
exposed  PTFE  portion  of  the  SRM  (or  a  similar  piece  of  sintered PTFE).    The  sample  spectrum  is  then  acquired 
from  the  glass  side  of  this  SRM.    The  reflectance  spectrum  of  the  standard  is  then  calculated  as  the  ratio  of  the 
sample to the reference spectrum.  For air-wavelength measurements the data density should be equal to or less than 
0.5 nm per data point.  For vacuum-wavenumber measurements, the data density should be no less than 1.0 cm–1 per 
data point.  These data spacings ensure that the centroid location method itself does not contribute significantly to 
the location bias.  Correction to absolute reflectance or for specular reflectance is not necessary as the bias for these 
is  included  in  the  location  uncertainties.    However,  the  front  surface  Fresnel  reflection  of  the  SRM  may  give 
reflectance values exceeding 100 % especially with fiber probes when referenced to the bare PTFE reference.  This 
will not affect the band location estimates within the stated uncertainties. 
 
Measurement of the SRM under a dry nitrogen purge is highly recommended.  If a nitrogen purge is not available, 
the  locations  of  band 1  and  band  3  may  differ  from  the  certified  values.    Acquire  the  reflectance  spectrum  at  a 
temperature of 23 C  3 C.  Compare each measured band location to its certified value listed in the appropriate 
Table 1  or  Table 2.    Band  locations  in  Table 1  are  vacuum-wavenumber  values,  while  those  in  Table 2  are 
air-wavelength values.  To convert the values in Table 1 to air wavenumber, the appropriate correction for the index 
of refraction of air must be applied [2].  Taking into account the certification uncertainty of each band of SRM 2036, 
any  statistically  significant  differences  between  the  measured  and  certified  band  locations  may  then  be  used  to 
recalibrate the spectrometer wavenumber/wavelength scale. 
 
Measurement  Conditions:    The  diffuse  reflectance  certification  measurements  for  the  NIR  spectral  region 
(10 300 cm−1  to  5 130 cm−1)  were  made  using  Bruker  IFS66  and  Bio-Rad  FTS-60  Fourier  transform (FT) 
spectrometers.(1)  The IFS66 spectrometer was equipped with a bifurcated-fiber-optic diffuse-reflectance probe.  The 
FTS-60 spectrometer was equipped with a custom integrating sphere assembly that enabled the measurement of the 
total (8° sampling geometry) and diffuse components of the reflectance spectrum of SRM 2036.  Details about this 
spectrometer can be found in references 3 and 4.  The IFS66 spectrometer calibration was validated with ambient 
water  vapor  bands,  SRM 2065  Ultraviolet-Visible-Near-Infrared  Transmission  Wavelength/Wavenumber  Standard 
(compositionally  identical  to  SRM 2036),  and  SRM 1920a  Near  Infrared  Reflectance  Wavelength  Standard  from 
740 nm to 2000 nm.  The FTS-60 spectrometer was calibrated using ambient water vapor and carbon dioxide bands. 
 
The  dispersive  air-wavelength  NIR  measurements  were  performed  on  a  PerkinElmer  Lambda  900 (PE900) 
spectrometer equipped with a 60 mm integrating sphere and a Varian Cary 5e spectrometer equipped with a 110 mm 
integrating  sphere  assembly.    Both  spectrometers  were  used  to  measure  the  total  and  diffuse  components  of  this 
standard.  The air-wavelength axis of the PE900 spectrometer was calibrated in the NIR using the emission lines of 
the internal deuterium lamp (second order of the grating), and using SRM 2065 for transmittance and SRM 1920a 
for diffuse reflectance.  The Cary 5e was calibrated using the same emission lines and standards as the PE900. 
 
The  transmission  spectra  of  the  optical  glass  only  (without  the  PTFE  backing)  were  measured  on  the  IFS66 
spectrometer  operated  in  transmission  mode.    SRM 2036  is  NOT  intended  for  use  as  a  transmission 
wavelength/wavenumber  standard.   However,  the homogeneity  of  this  melt  and  similarity  of  its  band  positions  to 
SRM 2065  were  determined  using  transmission  measurements.    For  these  transmission  measurements,  the  IFS66 
was  calibrated 
in  vacuum-wavenumber  units  using  SRM 2517  Wavelength  Reference  Absorption 
Cell-Acetylene [5].    The  calibration  of  the  spectrometer  was  validated  using  water  vapor  bands.    Details  of  the 
measurements and data analysis for both FT and dispersive measurements can be found in references 6 through 8. 
 
Wavenumber  and  Wavelength  Band  Location  Methodology:    The  method  used  to  determine  the  certified  
NIR  wavenumber  and  wavelength  band 
(center-of-gravity)  
technique [9–11].  If another technique is used, a comparison with the certified values may not be valid.  In this 
certificate,  positions  determined  with  the  centroid  algorithm  are  referred  to  as  band  locations.    For  SRM 2036 

locations  of  SRM 2036 

the  centroid 

is 

                                                           

(1) Certain  commercial  equipment,  instruments  or  materials  are  identified  in  this  certificate  to  adequately  specify  the 
experimental  procedure.    Such  identification  does  not  imply  recommendation  or  endorsement  by  the  National  Institute  of 
Standards and Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the 
purpose.

centroid  calculations,  a  10 %  fraction  of 
the  band  was  used  for  both  wavenumber  and  wavelength 
reflection-absorbance data.  Further information on the use of this algorithm with other NIST SRMs can be found in 
reference 10.   
 
Certified  Wavenumber  Band  Locations:    The  certified  vacuum-wavenumber  locations  listed  in  Table 1  were 
obtained at 8 cm−1
constant wavenumber resolution and are certified for operation between 21 °C and 26 °C.  The 
certified values represent the mean band locations from both the IFS66 fiber probe measurements and the FTS-60 
total  and  diffuse-component-only  measurements.    The  location  bias  for  each  of  these  modes  of  operation  is  well 
within  the  short-term  precision  variance  of  these  instruments  operated  in  diffuse  reflectance.    Atmospheric  water 
vapor  is  a  significant  source  of  variance  for  band  3,  and  this  band  should  be  used  with  caution  when  calibrating 
unpurged commercial spectrometers with SRM 2036. 
 
Certified  Wavelength  Band  Locations:    The  certified  values  for  the  NIR  air-wavelength  band  locations  for  the 
seven reflection-absorption bands for 3 nm, 5 nm, and 10 nm spectral slit width (SSW) resolution at 21 °C are listed 
in Table 2.  The certified values of the air-wavelength band locations represent the mean band locations from both 
the  Cary 5e  and  PE900  spectrometers  operated  in  both  total (specular  and  diffuse)  and  diffuse-only  collection 
geometries.  As for the FT measurements, the location bias for each of these modes of operation of the SRM was 
within the short-term precision variance of the dispersive spectrometers used for certification of this standard.  The 
NIR reflectance spectrum of SRM 2036 is illustrated in Figure 1. 
 
Certification  Uncertainty:  The  expanded  uncertainty (U95)  for  the  wavenumber  and  wavelength  band  locations 
given in Tables 1 and 2 are determined from the appropriate combination of component standard uncertainties (i.e., 
estimated  standard  deviations),  with  a  coverage  factor  based  on  the  Student’s  t-distribution,  to  define  the  interval 
within which the unknown value of the band/peak can be asserted to lie with a level of confidence of approximately 
95 % [12].    Components  of  the  uncertainty  for  the  vacuum-wavenumber  band  locations  include:  instrument  bias 
(two certification spectrometers), calibration of the NIST FT spectrometers, location shift due to temperature, water 
vapor interference, and the short-term precision variance.  Components of the uncertainties for the air-wavelength 
band locations include: instrument bias (two reference instruments) and the location uncertainty of the wavelength 
calibration standards.

Information Values: An information value is considered to be a value that will be of interest to the SRM user, but 
insufficient information is available to assess the uncertainty associated with the value [1].  Information values are 
intended  to  provide  additional  information  on  the  matrix.    The  approximate  location  of  the  band  edges  used  to 
calculate  band  fractions  in  vacuum  wavenumber (cm–1)  and  air wavelength (nm)  are  given  in  Table 3.    Regarding 
Band 1,  the  certified  band  locations  were  determined  using peak  fractions  associated  with  the  band edge  listed  in 
Table 3.    However,  an  inflection  point  arising  from  a  shoulder  peak  is  evident  in  the  reflectance  spectrum  of 
SRM 2036  at  approximately  1995 nm  (5 130 cm−1)  in  Figure 1.    This  inflection  point  can  be  used  for  the 
determination of a 10 % peak fraction for Band 1 but studies have shown that the centroid band location in this case 
will typically fall outside the certification uncertainties.  These studies revealed a bias in centroid band location for 
Band 1  using  a  10 %  peak  fraction  based  on  this  shoulder  peak  compared  to  that  used  for  the  certified  values  of 
approximately  +0.4 nm  for  wavelength  (e.g.,  1946.1 nm  for  3 nm  SSW)  and  –0.9 cm−1  for  wavenumber 
(e.g., 5138.5 cm−1). 
 
Information values for the NIR vacuum-wavenumber temperature coefficients and 0 °C degree intercepts are given 
in Table 4.  SRM 2036 has additional absorbance bands between 334 nm and 1000 nm.  The locations of these bands 
are currently not certified.  Information values on the location of these bands are provided in Table 5 for a SSW of 
5 nm.  The ultraviolet-visible reflectance spectrum of SRM 2036 is illustrated in Figure 2.
