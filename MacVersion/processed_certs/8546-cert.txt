Report of Investigation 

 
Reference Material 8546 
 
NBS28 
 
(Silicon and Oxygen Isotopes in Silica Sand) 
 
This Reference Material (RM) defines the NBS28 scale for isotope-number ratios of silicon (Si).  It is also used in 
developing and validating methods for measuring relative differences in isotope-number ratios of oxygen (O) in silicates.  
The equivalent name for this RM used by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the U.S. Geological 
Survey (USGS)  is  NBS28.    A  unit  of  RM 8546  consists  of  one  bottle  containing  approximately  0.4 g  of  silica 
sand (optical). 
 
Reference Values:  While the values for this RM (see Table 1) are either defined or reference values, its widespread use 
permits comparability of data from different laboratories.  A reference value is a non-certified value that is the best 
estimate of the true value; however, the value may reflect only the measurement precision and may not include all sources 
of uncertainty [1].

Expiration  of  Value  Assignment:    RM 8546  is  valid  indefinitely,  within  the  measurement  uncertainty  specified, 
provided  the  RM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  instructions  given  in  this  Report  of  Investigation 
(see “Instructions for Handling, Storage, and Use”).  Periodic validation of this RM is not required.  The reference values 
are nullified if the RM is damaged, contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of RM:  NIST will monitor this RM over the period of its validity.  If substantive technical changes occur 
that affect the value assignment before the expiration of this report, NIST will notify the purchaser.  Registration (see 
attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
The  technical  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  RM  were  coordinated  through the NIST Chemical Sciences

Division by R.D. Vocke, Jr. 
 
Support aspects involved in the issuance of this RM were coordinated through the NIST Office of Reference Materials.

RM 8546 

Reference  Values  for  the  Relative  Difference  in  Isotope-Number  Ratios:    The  differences  in  measured 
isotope-number  ratios  of  stable  silicon  isotopes  [N(29Si)/N(28Si)],  [N(30Si)/N(28Si)]  and  stable  oxygen  isotopes 
[N(18O)/N(16O)] are reported as δ29Si, δ30Si, and δ18O values, respectively.  The relative difference in isotope-number 
ratios for silicon and oxygen are defined as: 

δ29Si = ([N(29Si) sample/N(28Si) sample] – [N(29Si) NBS28 / N(28Si) NBS28]) / [N(29Si) NBS28 / N(28Si) NBS28] 

δ30Si = ([N(30Si) sample/N(28Si) sample] – [N(30Si) NBS28 / N(28Si) NBS28]) / [N(30Si) NBS28 / N(28Si) NBS28] 

δ18O = ([N(18O) sample/N(16O) sample] – [N(18O) VSMOW / N(16O) VSMOW]) / [N(18O) VSMOW / N(16O) VSMOW]

ING,  STORAGE,  AND  USE 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
Distribution:  The distribution of RM 8546 (NBS28) is limited to one unit per customer per three-year period of time. 
 
Storage and Stability:  RM 8546 is stable at normal room temperatures.  To minimize the potential for contamination, it 
ier  in  which  it  is  supplied. 
is recommended that this RM be stored in the container in which it is supplied. 
 
SOURCE, PREPARATION, AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
The
Sample Preparation:  RM 8546 (NBS28) was obtained by I. Friedman (USGS) from the Corning Glass Company.  The 
material was washed with acid to remove impurities and the fraction between 100 μm and 177 μm was separated and 
packaged. 
 
Analytical Methods:  The reference value for the δ18O of RM 8546 (NBS28) is a consensus mean involving eight 
independent measurements as reported at the 1993 IAEA Consultants’ Group Meeting on Stable Isotope Reference 
Samples [3]. 
 
The  relative  difference  in  isotope-number  ratios  for  Si  and  O  reported  in  Table 1  are  the  values  accepted  by  the 
Commission on Isotopic Abundances and Atomic Weights of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry 
(http://ciaaw.org/silicon.htm (accessed Mar 2015) and http://ciaaw.org/oxygen.htm (accessed March 2015), respectively) 
for this RM as of the date of this Report. 
 
Reporting  of  Stable  Isotope  δ  Values:    Authors  should  state  the  δ30Si  and  δ18O  values  of  other  internationally 
distributed  isotopic  reference  materials  similar  to  RM 8546  (NBS28)  which  have  been  interspersed  among  their 
unknowns.

(1)  Certain  commercial  equipment,  instrumentation, or materials are identified in this report to specify adequately the 
experimental procedure.  Such identification does not imply recommendation or endorsement by the NIST, nor does it imply that the 
materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the purpose.
