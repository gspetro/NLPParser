Reference Material 8541 
USGS24 Graphite 
(Carbon Isotopes in Graphite) 

 
This Reference Material (RM) is intended to provide a sample with a known isotope-amount ratio of carbon (C).  
The  equivalent  name  for  this  RM,  as  used  by  the  International  Atomic  Energy  Agency (IAEA)  and  the  U.S. 
Geological Survey (USGS), is USGS24 and is listed in column 2 of Table 1.  A unit of RM 8541 consists of one 
bottle containing approximately 0.8 g of graphite. 
 
Reference  Values:    A  NIST  Reference  Value  is  a  non-certified  value  that  is  a  best  estimate  of  the  true  value; 
however, the value does not meet NIST criteria for certification and is provided with an associated uncertainty that 
may not include all sources of uncertainty [1].

(a) The δ13C values are expressed as a mean ± an expanded uncertainty.  The expanded uncertainty is equal to U = kuc, 
where uc is the combined standard uncertainty as defined by the ISO and NIST Guide [2] and k is the coverage factor.  The 
value of the consensus mean and the associated combined standard uncertainty were calculated using a multivariate Bayesian 
approach [1].  The combined standard uncertainty is intended to represent, at the level of one standard deviation, the combined 
effects of Type A and B uncertainties on the reference value.  Uncertainty in the bias of the methods is not included.  The coverage 
factor k is 2 and provides an expanded uncertainty interval that has about a 95 % probability of encompassing the consensus 
mean. 
(b) Normalized to δ13CVPDB of RM 8545 (L-SVEC) = –46.6 ‰. 
 
Expiration of Value Assignment:  The reference value of RM 8541 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty 
specified, until 31 December 2020, provided the RM is handled in accordance with instructions given in this Report 
of Investigation (see “Instructions for Use”).  The reference value is nullified if the RM is damaged, contaminated, 
or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of RM:  NIST will monitor this RM over the period of its validity.  If substantive technical changes 
occur  that  affect  the  value  assignment  before  the  expiration  of  this  report,  NIST  will  notify  the  purchaser.  
Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification.

Reference Difference in Isotope-Amount Ratio Values:  The differences in measured isotope-amount ratios of 
stable  carbon  isotopes  [n(13C)/n(12C)]  are  reported  as  δ13C  values,  where  δ13C = ([nsample(13C)/nsample(12C)]  – 
[nVPDB(13C)/nVPDB(12C)])/ [nVPDB(13C)/nVPDB(12C)].  VPDB refers to the Vienna PDB scale, which is determined by 
assigning  a  δ13C  value  of  +1.95 ‰  to  RM 8544  (NBS 19) [3].    The  reported  δ13C  result  for  RM 8541  has  been 
normalized to yield a consensus value of –46.6 ‰ for RM 8545. 
 
The reference value for δ13C listed in Table 1 together with its expanded uncertainty are based on continuous flow 
elemental-analyzer  isotope-ratio  mass  spectrometry [4]  using  the  general  method  of  Qi  et  al. [5].    Four  expert

their results and the multivariate Bayesian approach for data reduction are described in detail in [1].  A reference 
value is a non-certified value that is the best estimate of the true value; however, the value may reflect only the 
measurement precision and may not include all sources of uncertainty. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 
 
Distribution:  The distribution of RM 8541 (USGS24) is limited to one unit per three-year period of time.  
 
Storage and Stability:  Graphite is stable at normal room temperatures.  This RM should be stored in the container 
in which it is supplied to the user.
