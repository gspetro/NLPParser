Certificate of Analysis 
Standard Reference Material® 2395 

 

 
Human Y-Chromosome DNA Profiling Standard 
 
This  Standard  Reference  Material  is  intended  primarily  for  use  in  the  standardization  of  forensic  and  paternity 
quality  assurance  procedures  for  polymerase  chain  reaction  (PCR)-based  genetic  testing  and  for  instructional  law 
enforcement or non-clinical research purposes that involve the human Y-chromosome.  In addition, SRM 2395 may 
be  used  to  standardize  nomenclature  for  the  field  of  genetic  genealogy.    This  SRM  can  also  be  used  for  quality 
assurance when assigning values to in-house control materials.  It is not intended for any human or animal clinical 
diagnostic use.  Additional information on each Y-chromosome marker can be found at a NIST-sponsored database 
on the Internet: http://www.cstl.nist.gov/biotech/strbase. 
 
This SRM is composed of well-characterized human genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in liquid form.  A unit 
of  SRM  2395  consists  of  six  frozen  components  (A  through  F)  packaged  in  one  box.    Each  component  contains 
50 µl of DNA at a concentration of approximately 1 ng/µL.  There are five male samples and one female sample in 
this SRM.  See Table 1 for a complete listing of the components. 
 
Certified Values:  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in 
that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [1].  The SRM is certified 
for  genetic  loci  on  the  human  Y-chromosome  [2–13].    Genetic  types  for  loci  were  certified  through  DNA 
quantitation, sequencing, interlaboratory testing, and typing methodologies.  Table 1 provides the quantitative PCR 
(qPCR)  results  from  multiple  analyses  of  two  SRM 2395  units  obtained  from  the  NIST  Measurement  Service 
Division  and  one  unit  from  the  NIST  Biochemical  Science  Division  stored  at  –20°C.    Table 2  lists  the  certified 
genetic  types  in  normal  font  for  41 different  Y-chromosome  short  tandem  repeat  (Y-STR)  markers.    All  certified 
types have been confirmed through DNA sequencing of the alleles for each of the 5 male components. 
 
Reference  Values:    A  NIST  Reference  Value  is  a  best  estimate  of  the  true  value  provided  by  NIST  where  all 
known  or  suspected  sources  of  bias  have  not  been  fully  investigated  by  NIST  [1].    Table 2  also  includes  three 
reference genetic types in bold font for different Y-STR markers.  Reference alleles have been typed but NOT fully 
confirmed through DNA sequencing.   
 
Informational Values:  An information value is considered to be a value that will be of interest and use to the SRM 
user,  but  for  which  insufficient  information  is  available  to  assess  adequately  the  uncertainty  associated  with  the 
value, or a value derived from a limited number of analyses [1].  Table 3 describes informational values for three 
additional Y-STR loci that have been typed but not yet sequenced.  Table 4 lists the genetic types for 42 different 
Y-chromosome  single  nucleotide  polymorphisms  (Y-SNPs)  determined  by  allele-specific  hybridization.    Figure 1 
displays results from the quadruplicated Y-STR DYS464. 
 
Expiration  of  Certification:    The  certification  of  SRM 2395  is  valid,  within  the  measurement  uncertainties 
specified,  until  31  December  2013,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  the  instructions 
given  in  this  certification  (see  “Instructions  for  Use”).    The  certification  is  nullified  if  the  SRM  is  damaged, 
contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance  of  SRM  Certification:    NIST  will  monitor  this  SRM  over  the  period  of  its  certification.    If 
substantive technical changes occur that affect the certification before the expiration of this certificate, NIST will 
notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
The overall direction and coordination of the technical activities leading to certification were under the leadership of 
M.C. Kline and J.M. Butler of the NIST Biochemical Science Division.

Analytical  determination  and  technical  measurements  leading  to  the  certification  of  this  SRM  were  performed  by 
staff of the NIST Biochemical Science Division:  M.C. Kline and J.W. Redman prepared the samples; J.M. Butler, 
R. Schoske, and P.M. Vallone initially evaluated the components using selected PCR amplification assays and kits 
to  determine  the  certified  genotypes;  A.E. Decker  and  M.C. Kline  evaluated  the  stability  of  the  components  in 
selected quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays; A.E. Decker performed a concordance evaluation of the components by 
comparing  the  initial  genotypes  with  recently  obtained  genotypes  using  Y-STR  PCR  amplification  kits;  and 
A.E. Decker performed sequencing and genotyping of 21 Y-STR loci to determine certified and reference values. 
 
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the NIST Measurement Services 
Division. 
 
The preparation of this SRM was supported in part by the National Institute of Justice, U.S. Department of Justice. 
 
NOTICE AND WARNINGS TO USER 

Storage:    All  six  components  must  be  stored  frozen  at  a  temperature  of  –20  ºC.    DO  NOT  use  a  self-defrosting 
freezer because periodic cycling of temperatures may cause a shortened shelf-life of this SRM. 
 
Handling:    SRM  2395  IS  A  HUMAN  SOURCE  MATERIAL.    SINCE  THERE  IS  NO  CONSENSUS  ON  THE 
INFECTIOUS STATUS OF EXTRACTED DNA, HANDLE THE SRM 2395 COMPONENTS AS BIOSAFETY 
LEVEL 1 MATERIALS CAPABLE OF TRANSMITTING INFECTIOUS DISEASE [14].  SRM 2395 components 
and derived solutions should be disposed of in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 

Sample  aliquots  for  analysis  should  be  withdrawn  immediately  after  opening  the  vials  and  should  be  processed 
without delay for the certified values to be applicable.  Let samples warm up to laboratory ambient temperature for 
2 hours before use.  
 
SOURCE AND ANALYSIS1

(a) These values have all been confirmed through DNA sequencing at NIST (see STRBase for repeat motif information) except 

for the three reference values in bold. 

(b) Components B and C for DYS447 are listed as 25 repeats.  However, B contains 9-1-8-1-6 while C is 7-1-8-1-8 in terms of 

[TAATA]-[TAAAA]-[TAATA]-[TAAAA]-[TAATA] repeats (see STRBase). 

(c) Three different nomenclatures have been published for DYS448 [10].  The one listed here follows Redd et al [6]. 
(d) The H4 nomenclature follows Butler et al. [5]; also see reference 16.

Information  in  Table  3  has  not  been  fully  confirmed  through  direct  DNA  sequencing  of  the  SRM  components.  
DYS464 is quadruplicated on the Y-chromosome and can produce up to four separate peaks (see Figure 1).  Both 
expanded and conservative methods for calling DYS464 alleles are listed (see references 6 and 11).
