This Standard Reference Material (SRM ) is intended primarily for use in the determination of sheet resistance and 
bulk resistivity using the DC four-point probe method [1 ,2].  SRM 2543 is a nominal 100 mm diameter Czochralski-
grown, boron-doped silicon wafer with ( 100) crystallographic orientation.  The wafer has a nominal thickness of 
0.625 mm. 
 
Wafer preparation was performed utilizing a simultaneous two-sided lapping process with a nominal 12 µm 
aluminum oxide abrasive.  This wafer unit was individually  measured.  The certified sheet resistance and resistivity 
values at the wafer’s center are given in Table 1a and the sheet resistance is given at 60° increments on the radii of 
5 mm and 10 mm circles in Table 1b.  The stated uncertain
ty values for this unit are derived from a statistical 
analysis of the entire lot of wafers produced at the 1 ohm ·cm resistivity level.  A summary of these uncertainties is 
given in Table 2. 
 
Previous silicon resistivity SRMs have also been used

utility, but it must be emphasized that NIST has rigorous
silicon.  This SRM cannot be used as a thickness reference standard.

SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the “Care a

Certified Value Uncertainties:   The uncertainties for the certified values were calculated in accordance with the 
ISO and NIST Guides [3].  The sources of uncertainty ar
given in reference 4.  It is assumed that rectangular dist ributions underlie all Type B uncertainty determinations; for 
a rectangular distribution, the variance is one-third of the half-width.  The combined uncertainty is obtained from the 
square-root of the sum of the Type A and Type B vari ances.  The expanded uncertainty is obtained by multiplying 
this combined uncertainty by a coverage factor; following NI ST guidelines, a coverage factor of two is used, and the 
expanded uncertainty is written as a 2  σ value.  There are 25 800 degrees of freedom for the uncertainty of center 
averages and 21 500 degrees of freedom for the uncertainty of individual measurements.   
 
 by Type A evaluations:  1) electrical measurement 
The following components of uncertainty were determined
process precision (short term) was estimated from a pooling of the wafer center measurement variances of the 104 
wafers in this batch with corresponding variances from pre-  and post-certification control experiments; 2) day-to-day 
and longer term process variabilities were obtained fro
m comparison of pre- and post-certification control 
experiment values and from check wafer data taken during the course of the certification;  3) the effect of using a 
single four-point probe, out of all possible probes, for 
which utilized multiple probes; 4) dependence, upon ambient illu mination level, of the resistivity value measured for 
this SRM was estimated from additional measurements - in  the dark, and in illumination sufficiently bright (krypton 
bulb) to reach saturation.  The combined variance from th
resistivity values.  An additional term for the typical va
included in the uncertainty for resistivity values, but not 
measurement process variance contributes only one-sixth as much to the uncertainty of the average of 6 
measurements as it does to the uncertainty of the individual measurements.)

Measurement Procedure:   Each unit was individually measured by using a single in-line probe with nominal 
1.59 mm probe point separation and meeting the specificati
ons of ASTM F84 [1] for bulk silicon.  The dual-
configuration method [2,5] of four-point probe measuremen ts was used, with configuration “A” being identical to 
that in ASTM F84.  Eighteen measurements were taken on each  wafer:  six were taken at the wafer center, separated 
by rotations of approximately 30° (these are averaged and reported for the center as a single location); six were taken 
at sites separated by rotations of 60° around a circle of ra
circle of radius 10 mm (0.4 in), again with rotational se parations of 60°.  The measurements described by these two 
circles started on the positive X-axis (negative Y-axis is  normal to the wafer flat) and proceeded counterclockwise. 
Due to the nature of resistivity variations in silicon, the va lues certified for these circles cannot be used to predict the 
resistivity in other regions of the wafer. 
 
A DC current value was selected to give a measured specimen voltage between 9.95 mV and 10.05 mV in 
configuration “A” for the first measurement at the wafer center.  This current setting was maintained on the current 
supply for all subsequent measurements.  Values of current  at each of the measurement sites were determined to five 
or more digits using a standard resistor. 
 
Thickness uniformity for the region of the electrical measur ements was evaluated for each wafer by using the nine-
site plan of ASTM Method F84, with a radius of appr
pattern.  All points were required to have a thickness within
acceptable for use as an SRM.  The average of all nine thickness measurements for this wafer is given in Table 3 and 
should be used to convert from sheet resistance to resistivity for each of the electrical measurement sites.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 
 
Notes on SRM Use:   A four-point probe with spacing equal to or  greater than twice the wafer thickness effectively 
averages sheet resistance from front to back surfaces of a  wafer.  For this reason, either surface of the SRM wafer 
may be measured by the user’s four-point probe with negligible expected differences in the values measured. 
 
When the user needs to convert sheet resistance values
recommends using the thickness value given in this Certificat e to obtain best agreement with the certified resistivity 
value.  Due to the lapped surface texture of this wafer, independent thickness measurements by the user are likely to 
result in a slightly different value from that reported here, pa rticularly if a different type of thickness gauge is used.  
This would result in a degraded transfer of resistivity  scale using this SRM although it would have no bearing on the 
transfer of the sheet resistance value.   Due to its lapped surface texture,  this wafer cannot be used as a reference 
material for wafer thickness. 
 
Care and Handling:   The lapped surfaces of this SRM give it 
as the use of gloves, finger cots, vacuum paddles, or 
stability.  Nevertheless, reasonable care in handling, such 
ss.  Storage in any reasonable, noncorrosive, nontoxic 
tweezers should be excercised to maintain wafer cleanline
environment, in conjunction with the packaging provided,
 should prove adequate for maintaining stability of the 
SRM.  Cleaning with the proper surfactant or with isopr opyl alcohol, together with thorough rinsing in deionized 
water and thorough drying, has been found acceptable for re moving most surface stains.  The use of hydrofluoric 
acid or elevated temperature treatments  is discouraged.  The SRM should not be stored or measured in an ambient 
relative humidity above 50 %. 
 
Cautions to User:   NIST strongly recommends that this SRM not be used alone for calibration or for testing the 
linearity or other performance characteristic of sheet resist ance/resistivity measuring equipment.  For any of these 
applications, use one or more of the other wafers in the SRM series 2541 through 2547 in addition to this SRM. 
 
NIST recommends that the user generate secondary standa rds based on this SRM rather than employ it for routine 
use [6].  This is particularly important for users of f our-point probe instruments which may gradually damage silicon 
wafers with repeated probing.

sistance measurement instruments or for evaluating the 
This SRM may not be appropriate for calibrating sheet re
sheet resistance/resistivity of materials other than silicon due  to differences of material and instrument parameters 
relative to single crystal silicon wafers and to DC conduc
tion measurements.  Among the material parameters are 
conduction and carrier scattering mechanisms, grain boundary effects on conduction, and the relative importance of 
sample surface vs bulk in responding to the measurement s timulus.  Instrument parameters include electromagnetic 
frequency of the measurement stimulus, the associated sk in depth in the materials being measured, and sampling 
volume of the instrumentation in relation to material grain  size.  Parties interested in extending the calibration use of 
these SRMs are advised to contact Dr. James R. Ehrste
(301) 975-2060. 
 
Silicon has a noticeable temperature dependence for resistivity .  Accurate values of the temperature coefficient of 
silicon resistivity are available for the range 18 °C to 28 °C  [1].  If the user makes measurements at a temperature 
other than 23 °C, the resulting resistivity and sheet resistan ce values must be corrected to 23 °C for best agreement 
with the certified values.  Corrections for measurements  made outside of the 18 °C to 28 °C range may suffer from 
reduced accuracy. 
 
The localized variations in resistivity typically found in silicon wafers such as those of this SRM may limit the user’s 
ability to obtain exactly the certified values if instrumentation is employed having a sampling volume different from 
that of a 1.59 mm four-point probe.  However, it is likely 
that imprecision of the user’s instrumentation will be a 
more important limitation to transfer of the certified value than differences in sampling volume.

ement sites for better characterization of resistivity 

ace the previously issued silicon resistivity sets, 
advantages:  1) larger size for better equipment 

 
The SRM 2541 through SRM 2547 series is intended to repl
SRM 1521 through SRM 1523, and offer several comparative 
compatibility; 2) better uniformity of both thickness and resi stivity; 3) reduced measurement uncertainty due to an 
improved certification procedure; and 4) additional measur
uniformity.   
 
Stability Tests:   Silicon wafers from all previous resistivity SR Ms have been monitored by NIST for as long as 
15 years with no cumulative drift of the measured resistivity  values.  While there were some measurement values in 
that monitoring sequence that were outside the confidence  limits determined from the certification uncertainty, those 
outlier values are believed to have been due to long-term  measurement environment variability as well as to the use 
of single-configuration probe measurements, which are more  sensitive to changes of probes or to probe tip condition 
than are the dual-configuration measurements used for current SRM certification. 
 
Tests of the stability of silicon resistivity reference materials with repeated probing have shown that it is possible to 
make several thousand probe measurements without significant changes of value, even when the probing is confined 
to a very localized area.   However, the use of excessively sharp or  damaged probes, or of unconditioned new 
probes, may accelerate the   accumulation of crystalline damage  that leads to a shift in resistivity values or 
degraded measurement repeatability.  This is particularly tr ue for float zone or NTD silicon, both of which have low 
oxygen content and are more susceptible to crystalline damage from mechanical contact.  
 
Multilaboratory Measurement Reproducibility:  
resistivity measurements are useful for guidance on confid
ence intervals that might be expected when using this 
SRM to transfer resistivity scale values between NIST a nd the user’s laboratory.  While there have not been any 
reported multilaboratory tests using the dual-configuration  method of measurement, a number of tests have been 
conducted by ASTM using the single-configuration 
multilaboratory precision of just under 0.7 % for wafers with resistivities up to 120 ohm ·cm, and just under 1.7 % for 
wafers between 120 ohm·cm and 500 ohm·cm.  These values lead to 99 % confidence intervals of  ± 2 % for wafers up 
to 120 ohm ·cm and  ± 5 % for wafers between 120 ohm ·cm and 500 ohm ·cm [1].  Because of the relatively 
hose ASTM multilaboratory tests, the resulting confidence 
nonuniform, small (5 cm) diameter wafers used for t
intervals are believed to be quite conservative compared
 to what could be expected on wafers with improved 
uniformity such as those from this SRM series, particular ly if the dual-configuration four-point probe methodology 
were employed by all laboratories.
