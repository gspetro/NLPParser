Certificate of Analysis 
Standard Reference Material® 2782 

Industrial Sludge 

 
This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  use  in  the  evaluation  of  methods  used  for  the 
analysis of sludges and other materials of a similar matrix.  A unit of SRM 2782 consists of 70 g of dried, pulverized, 
and radiation sterilized industrial sludge. 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values:  The certified values, expressed as mass fractions on a dry basis, for ten elements 
are reported in Table 1.  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy 
in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or accounted for by NIST [1].  The certified 
values in this SRM are based on either a single NIST primary method or on concordant results from NIST and two or 
more collaborating laboratories.  A certified value is the present best estimate of the true value. 
 
Reference Mass Fraction Values:  Reference values, expressed as mass fractions on a dry basis, for 16 additional 
elements are reported in Table 2.  A NIST reference value are noncertified value that is the present best estimate of 
the  true  value;  however,  the  value  does  not  meet  NIST  criteria  for  certification  and  are  provided  with  associated 
uncertainties that may reflect only measurement reproducibility and may not include all sources of uncertainty or may 
reflect a lack of sufficient statistical agreement among multiple analytical methods [1].  The reference values in this 
SRM are based on a combination of results from collaborating laboratories. 
 
Information Mass Fraction Values:  Information values are listed in Table 3.  These values may be of interest to the 
SRM user and represent results from one or more collaborating laboratories.  Insufficient information is available to 
adequately assess the uncertainty associated with these values [1]. 
 
Analytical methods used for the characterization of this SRM are given in Table 4.  All values are reported as mass 
fractions [2], on a dry mass basis and are based on measurements using a sample mass of at least 100 mg. 
 
Leachable  Mass  Fractions:    Reference  values  for  14 acid-leachable  mass  fractions  using  U.S.  Environmental 
Protection  Agency (EPA) 3050,  3051,  and  New  Jersey  Department  of  the  Environment (NJDEP) 100 methods  are 
contained  in  Appendix A.    These  values  are  the  means  of  all  results  supplied  by  cooperating  EPA  and  NJDEP 
laboratories for the different leach and measurement methods used. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 2782 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until 1 October 2023, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with instructions given in this certificate 
(See “Instructions for Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification.

Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Office  of  Reference 
Materials. 
 
Source and Preparation of Material:  The base material for SRM 2782 was obtained as effluence from an industrial 
site in northern New Jersey involved in pharmaceutical research and was collected before treatment with the assistance 
of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.  The base  material  was  freeze dried at a commercial 
facility under contract to NIST, and transferred to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in Denver, CO.  At USGS the 
material was ball milled to pass a 75 µm (200 mesh) sieve and then blended into a single lot using a 0.2832 m3 (10 ft3) 
blender.  The blended material was radiation sterilized and then bottled at USGS. 
 
Analysis:  The homogeneity was assessed at USGS on replicate samples of bulk material for over 40 elements using 
x-ray 
inductively  coupled  plasma  atomic  emission  spectrometry (ICP-AES).  
Homogeneity  was  further  assessed  during  certification  analysis  with  sample  sizes  of  100 mg  or  greater.    No 
sample-to-sample variations in excess of those expected from the analytical measurements were detected. 
 
Instructions for Use:  A minimum sample mass of 100 mg (dry mass - see “Instructions for Drying”) should be used 
te  dissolution  for  analytical  determinations  to 
and sample preparation procedures should be designed to effect complete dissolution for analytical determinations to 
be related to the certified values provided. 
 
Instructions for Drying:  When nonvolatile elements are to be determined, samples should be vacuum dried at room 
temperature for 24 h or oven dried for 2 h at 110 ºC.  Volatile elements (e.g., arsenic, mercury, and selenium) should 
be determined on samples as received; separate samples should be dried according to these instructions to obtain a 
correction factor for moisture.  Moisture corrections are then made to measurement values before comparing them to 
the certified values.  [Note:  The mass loss on drying at the time of certification was found to be in the range of 2.1 % 
to 3.2 % when using the recommended drying procedures.] 
 
Certified Values and Uncertainties:  The measurands are the total mass fractions of selected elements in industrial 
sludge. The certified values are metrologically traceable to the SI unit for mass.  The certified values for Cd, Cu, Pb, 
Mo and Ni are based on a primary NIST method.  The certified values for the remaining elements are the results from 
two or more independent analytical methods as described by Schiller and Eberhardt [3].  The uncertainty in the values 
certified by a NIST primary method is expressed as an expanded uncertainty, U, and is calculated according to the 
method described in the ISO Guide [4].  The expanded uncertainty is calculated as U = kuc, where uc is intended to 
represent, at the level of one standard deviation, the combined effect of uncertainty components associated with the 
measurement  uncertainty  and  basis  weight  uncertainty.    The  coverage  factor,  k,  is  determined  from  the 
Student t-distribution corresponding to the appropriate associated degrees of freedom and 95 % confidence for each 
method.  The uncertainty in the values certified from combined independent method data is calculated as, U = kuc + B.  
The quantity, uc, is the combined standard uncertainty calculated according to ISO Guide [4], which accounts for the 
combined effect of the within variance for all participating laboratories at one standard deviation.  The bias adjustment, 
B, is for the difference between methods, which is the maximum difference between the certified value and the method 
means [3].

Reference  Values  and  Uncertainties:    The  measurands  are  the  mass  fractions  of  selected  elements  in  industrial 
sludge as determined by the methods indicated in Table 4.  The reference values are metrologically traceable to the 
SI unit for mass.  The reference values are the means of the results from two or more independent analytical methods.  
The uncertainty in the reference values is expressed as an expanded uncertainty, U, and is calculated according to the 
method described in the ISO Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement [4].  The expanded uncertainty 
is calculated as U = kuc, where uc is intended to represent, at the level of one standard deviation, the combined effect 
of between-laboratory and within-laboratory components of uncertainty. The coverage factor, k, is determined from 
the Student t-distribution corresponding the appropriate associated degrees of freedom and 95 % confidence for each 
element.  As the accuracy of the measurements could not be assessed from the data, the uncertainty associated with a 
reference value may fail to include all sources of uncertainties and may represent only a measure of the precision of 
the measurement methods.

APPENDIX A 
 
Leachable Mass Fractions Using U.S. EPA and NJDEP Methods  
 
The U.S. EPA in its monitoring programs, has established a number of leach methods such as Methods [5] for the 
determination  of  acid  labile  or  extractable  mass  fractions  of  elements.    The  New  Jersey  Department  of  the 
Environment (NJDEP) has developed its own leach method for state use [6].  The NJDEP and the U.S. EPA prepared 
samples of SRM 2782 using the NJDEP 100 method and EPA Methods 3050 and 3051 and analyzed the resulting 
leachates by FAAS, flame emission spectrometry (FES), and ICP-AES.  Based upon these results, method dependent 
reference values have been developed for EPA 3050, 3051, and NJDEP 100 methods.  
 
SRM 2782 has been certified for total mass fractions of constituent elements and thereby requires complete sample 
decomposition.  However, for a number of environmental monitoring purposes, acid extractable mass  fractions of 
elements are often used rather than total mass fractions.  Acid extractable methods do not necessarily result in total 
decomposition of the sludge.  It should be noted that results obtained using acid leach conditions are often depicted in 
reports as “total” results or total recoverable results.  However, reported acid labile or extractable mass fractions of 
elements are generally lower than total mass fractions (see Table A1, Percentage Leach Recovery).  Results are often 
presented  as  measured  mass  fractions  in  the  leachate  in  comparison  to  the  total  or  certified  mass  fractions.    The 
recovery of an element as a percent of total is a function of several factors such as the mode of occurrence in the 
sample, leach medium, leach time, temperature conditions, and pH of the sample-leach medium mixture [7].  
 
Reference Values and Uncertainties:  Reference values have been established for the acid-leachable mass fractions 
of fourteen elements in SRM 2782. These values are the means of all results from the different leach and measurement 
methods used.  Please note that because EPA method 3051 did not provide useable results for silver, its results were 
excluded.  In addition, variation in arsenic, cadmium, and vanadium data prevented their use as reference values.  The 
reference values given in Table 1 are not NIST certified but are provided as a reference for U.S. EPA 3050, 3051, and 
NJDEP 100 methods.  The reference values along with their uncertainties are based on 95 % confidence intervals 
of  the  means  of  results.    The  uncertainties  include  within-laboratory  and  between-laboratory differences,  which 
were significant for some elements.
