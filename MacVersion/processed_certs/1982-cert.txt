Thermal Spray Powder – Particle Size Distribution 
Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia (Spheroidal) 
 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is primarily intended for use in the calibration of equipment used to measure 
particle  size  distributions (PSD)  in  the  10 μm  to  150 μm  range.    A  unit  of  SRM 1982  consists  of  a  single  bottle 
containing approximately 10 g of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) powder.   
 
The  PSD  values  at  five  mass  percentiles  were  measured  by  scanning  electron  microscopy (SEM)  and  laser  light 
scattering (LLS), and sieving [1].  The certified PSD values by SEM are listed in Table 1.  These certified values were 
determined by the measurement of over 20 000 individual particles from five bottles.  The reference PSD values by 
LLS and sieving are listed in Tables 2 and 3.  A comparison of all three methods is shown in Figure 1.

Certified  Value  Uncertainties:    The  measurand  is  the  diameter  for  each  cumulative  mass  listed  in  Table 1.  
Metrological traceability is to the SI unit for length (expressed as micrometers).  The uncertainty at each percentile, 
computed  according  to  the  ISO/JCGM  and  NIST  Guides [2],  is  an  expanded  uncertainty  at  the  95 %  level  of 
confidence, which includes uncertainty due to measurement imprecision as well as material variability.  Each certified 
diameter with its expanded uncertainty defines a diameter range within which the associated percentile is expected to 
lie for at least 95 % of the samples.

Expiration  of  Certification:    The  certification  of  SRM 1982  is  valid  indefinitely,  within  the  measurement 
uncertainty  specified, prior to  use provided  the  unit  has not been  spilled, contaminated, or otherwise modified.  
The  SRM 1982  powder  contains  no  organic  binder  and  is  therefore  considered  chemically  stable.    If  sieving  is 
performed, it is recognized that some powder will be lost with each use.  When the unit’s mass loss exceeds 2 % of 
the original mass, the certification is void.  If employing LLS, the unit or subdivision thereof should be discarded after 
a single use.

Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical changes occur that affect the certification, NIST will notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet 
or register online) will facilitate notification.

Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Office  of  Reference 
Materials. 
 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
SRM Preparation and Bottling:  The starting material was a 9.08 kg batch of powder from a single lot (95087G-3A) 
of YSZ produced by Metallurgical Technologies Inc. (Pearland, TX).  This powder was chosen for its size distribution, 
spheroidal particle morphology (Figure 2) and low degree of aggregation.  The powder was split using spinning rifflers 
into bottle units containing approximately 10 g each.  A randomized set of 100 bottles from the 730 bottles prepared 
was selected for homogeneity testing and certification analyses.  Ten bottles were sent to Leeds and Northrup Co. 
(St. Petersburg, FL) for homogeneity determination, (Microtrac model X-100).  The remaining bottles were set aside 
for use in the SEM microscopy, sieving analysis, and Microtrac round robin study. 
 
Scanning Electron Microscopy Analysis:  SEM based image analysis was carried out on six samples using five of 
the 10 g bottles with two tests run on one bottle.  Sample preparation for microscopy entailed both a reduction in the 
mass of powder and a separation into size fractions.  The size fractionation was accomplished by sieving with a Sonic 
Sifter  (ATM  Corp.,  Milwaukee, WI)  using  U.S.  Standard  Series  sieves  numbers  170 (90 μm),  200 (75 μm), 
230 (63 μm),  270 (53 μm),  325 (45 μm)  and  400 (38 μm).    Subsamples  from  each  of  the  sieve  splits  were  then 
produced by successive division using a spinning riffler.  
 
SEM images were acquired for each of the nine sieve fractions.  The backscatter electron images of the particles were 
acquired as greyscale image files into a computer via a digital interface.  The 1024 x 1024 pixel images were analyzed 
to obtain the projected area of each zirconia particle.  These areas were converted to a particle volume and particle 
diameter  based  on  the  assumption  of  spherical  particle  shape.    The  pixel-to-length  conversion  was  calibrated  by 
collecting  digital  images  of  calibrated  standard  NIST  RM 8090  SEM  Magnification  Reference  Material  and  of  a 
micrometer slide measured at NIST using laser interferometry.  The two calibration standards agreed to within a length 
uncertainty of 1 %.  Several hundred particles were measured for each sieve fraction for a total of approximately 4 000 
zirconia particles measured from each bottle.  Particle size distributions describing the percentage of powder volume 
represented by particles with diameters less than a given length were calculated using the weighting factors obtained 
from the sieving results.  The diameter values corresponding to the specific mass fractions of 10 %, 25 %, 50 %, 75 %, 
and 90 % are listed in Table 1.  Current practice in the thermal spray industry is to specify these values to define the 
particle size distribution.  A graphical comparison of the mean of the SEM distributions with the mean distributions 
obtained by sieve analysis and laser light scattering is shown in Figure 1.  The diameter values for the sieve analyses 
were obtained by using the nominal ASTM mesh opening for each sieve. 
 
The sieve results indicated that only about 2 % by mass of the material exceeds 90 μm in diameter in contrast to the 
result  of  20 %  obtained  by  light  scattering.    This  discrepancy  is  expected  to  result  mainly  from  the  effect  of  the 
breaking up of particle clusters by the sonic vibration associated with the sieving. 
 
Laser Light Scattering Analysis by Microtrac Instrument:  Nine laboratories participated in this round robin study.  
Each round robin participant received four bottles for analysis using their model of the Microtrac Instrument.  The 
reference distribution values given in Table 2 are based on 42 measurements by the nine participating laboratories.  
The  data  from  all  nine  laboratories  were  obtained  using  Microtrac  Instrumentation  models  7995,  7997,  158704, 
FRA 9220, and X-100 following the sample preparation procedure specified by NIST.  Therefore, in the use of this 
SRM for LLS, the sample dispersion procedure is mandatory, otherwise the data may not be comparable. 

                              

(1) Certain  commercial  equipment,  instruments,  or  materials  are  identified  in  this  certificate  to  adequately  specify  the 
experimental procedure.  Such identification does not imply recommendation or endorsement by the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the purpose.

Although  Microtrac  instruments  produce  a  continuous  plot  of  weight  percentage  finer  than  a  given  diameter,  five 
cumulative percentiles were selected as a representative data set, consistent with current industrial practice.  Weighted 
averages  of  each  participant’s  data  are plotted  in  Figure 3.    Analysis  from  ten  samples  in  duplicate  by  Leeds  and 
Northrup showed no evidence of material heterogeneity.

The  measurand  is  the  diameter  for  each  cumulative  mass  listed  in  Table 2  as  determined  by  LLS.    Metrological 
traceability is to the SI unit for length (expressed as micrometers).  The expanded uncertainties, computed according 
to the ISO/JCGM and NIST Guides [2], include between-laboratories and within-laboratory uncertainty and have a 
joint level of confidence of 95 %.  The reference values and their expanded uncertainties for the five percentiles stated, 
define  a  range  within  which  the  true  percentiles  of  the  distribution  are  expected  to  lie  with  approximately  95 % 
confidence for all five percentiles considered together. 
 
Sample Dispersion Procedure for Light Scattering Microtrac Method:  Use of this SRM for the reference PSD 
values by the Microtrac method requires rigorous adherence to this sample dispersion procedure.  Otherwise, results 
may not be comparable to the reference values listed in Table 2.  Each SRM unit contains 10 g powder sufficient for 
one PSD analysis by older Microtrac instruments.  For newer Microtrac instruments such as model X-100, a smaller 
sample size is needed and a micro-riffler is recommended for splitting the 10 g sample into subsamples of the desired 
mass.  Another satisfactory splitting method may be used if a micro-riffler is unavailable [3].  Once used, samples 
should be discarded. 
 
To prepare solutions and  measurements,  use distilled  water for  which the pH is adjusted to 9.5 ± 0.1 using 0.1 M 
sodium  hydroxide.    Make  a  paste  of  sample  powder  by  adding  separately  prepared  4 %  (by  mass)  sodium 
pyrophosphate solution at the ratio of 0.5 cm3 per gram powder.  Transfer the paste quantitatively (totally) into the 
measuring  cell  containing  pH-adjusted  distilled  water.    The  transfer  of  the  paste  can  be  achieved  by  flushing  the 
container with pH-adjusted distilled water.  
 
for  instrument  operation
The size measurement is carried out by following the instrument manufacturer's procedure for instrument operation 
and determination of PSD. 
 
Sieving Analysis:  Ten samples were analyzed by sieving using wire mesh screen numbers 120, 170, 200, 230, 270, 
325, and 400.  A Sonic Sifter was used in this analysis with the following settings:  10 min at amplitude setting 3, and 
pulse/shift mode.  One bottle of this SRM was used for each test.  The measurand is the mass fraction for each sieved 
mass listed in Table 3 as determined by method indicated.  Metrological traceability is to the SI derived unit for mass 
(expressed as a percent).  The stated uncertainties represent one standard deviation from the mean of the mass fractions 
passing each sieve.
