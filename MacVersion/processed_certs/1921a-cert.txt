Infrared Transmission Wavelength Standard 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended primarily for use in calibrating the wavelength (wavenumber) 
scale of spectrophotometers in the infrared (IR) spectral region from 3.2 μm to 18.5 μm (540 cm-1 to 3125 cm-1).  A 
unit of SRM 1921a consists of a matte finish polystyrene film approximately 38 μm thick with a 25 mm diameter 
exposed area, centered 38 mm from the bottom of a cardboard holder, which is 5 cm × 11 cm × 0.2 cm in size. 
 
Certified Wavelength (Wavenumber) Values:  The spectral transmittance of a statistically representative group of 
the  polystyrene  film  SRM  specimens  was  measured  under  both  vacuum  and  purge  conditions.    The  positions  of 
absorption bands in the range of 3.2 μm to 18.5 μm were obtained using both a centroid method as well as a band 
minimum determination method.  Thirteen of the band locations were selected for certification based on experimental 
and statistical analysis results.  The certified wavelength values and associated uncertainties of these bands are shown 
in Tables 1 and 3 for the centroid and band minimum methods, respectively.  The corresponding wavenumber values 
and  associated  uncertainties  of  the  bands  are  shown  in  Tables  2  and  4,  respectively.    See  section  entitled  “Band 
Wavenumber and Wavelength Determination” for details.  To aid the user in distinguishing among the bands during 
measurement, a spectrum is shown in Figure 1, with arrows identifying the certified bands.  For band wavelength and 
wavenumber  values  measured  in  air  or  under  purge  conditions,  see  section  entitled  “Correction  for  Air/Nitrogen 
Purge”. 
 
The expanded uncertainty, U, is provided for each certified band wavelength and wavenumber.  It is the product of 
the coverage factor, k = 4, and the combined standard uncertainty.  The combined standard uncertainty is the root sum 
of squares of all the uncertainty components [1–3]. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 1921a is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until 31 December 2016, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given in this 
certificate  (see  “Storage  and  Handling”  and  “Instructions  for  Use”).    The  certification  is  nullified  if  the  SRM  is 
damaged, contaminated, otherwise modified.

Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Storage and Handling:  When not in use, SRM 1921a should be kept in its accompanying protective cover.  For 
storage, it is advisable to keep the SRM in a desiccator cabinet.  The SRM should always be handled with care; the 
exposed film surface should never be touched by fingers or any other objects.  Dust may be removed by blowing with 
clean, dry air. 
 
Overall direction and coordination of the technical measurements leading to certification were performed under the 
supervision of R.V. Datla and L.M. Hanssen of NIST Sensor Science Division. 
 
Technical measurements leading to certification were performed by C. Zhu and L.M. Hanssen of NIST. 
 
Statistical consultation was provided by J.J. Filliben of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division. 
 
Support aspects involved in issuance of this SRM were coordinated through the NIST Office of Reference Materials.

SRM 1921a 

Source of Material:  The polystyrene film used for SRM 192la was taken from a single roll.  It was manufactured by 
the Dow Chemical Company and donated by the Coblentz Society. 
 
Measurement Conditions:  The calibration measurements were made using a Bomem DA-3.02(1)  Fourier transform 
spectrophotometer.  The instrument room temperature was maintained at 22 °C ± l °C and the humidity ranged from 
30  %  to  50  %  during  the  measurements.    Calibration  measurements  were  made  under  vacuum  level  pressures  of 
50 Pa (0.4 Torr), as well as under a purge gas of clean air (with CO2 and H2O removed).  Details of the measurement 
methodology can be found in reference 3. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 
 
Calibration Measurements:  Prior to calibration with SRM 1921a, the spectrophotometer should be set up under the 
following conditions: 
 
Step 1.  Set the instrumental resolution to any value up to 2 cm-1.  A resolution of 4 cm-1 can be used with Fourier 
transform  spectrophotometers  provided  that  Boxcar  or  no  apodization  is  used  in  the  Fourier  transform 
processing [4,5].  Within these constraints, the most appropriate resolution for calibration is the one that is 
used for typical sample measurements.  

with  SRM 

Step 2.  Set the source aperture to provide sufficient signal for  measurement,  yet not greater than that required to 
maintain measurement resolution.  The setting should not be so large that the wavenumber shift error becomes 
significant [6] or the detector becomes significantly non-linear [7,8]. 

Step 3.  Close and purge or evacuate the sample chamber for a time suitable for the instrument to reach pressure and 

Step 4.  Obtain at least six transmittance spectra of SRM 1921a for statistical evaluation. 
Step 5.  Analyze the resulting spectra for band locations as described in the next section. 
Step 6.  When appropriate, apply the results to correct the spectrometers wavelength/wavenumber scale as described 

temperature equilibrium. 

in the last section. 

 
ulting  transmittance  spectra  should  be  analyzed 
Steps 3 to 5 should be repeated in sequence at least six times.  The resulting transmittance spectra should be analyzed 
for band locations as described below. 
 
Band  Wavenumber  and  Wavelength  Determination:    Two  methods  have  been  used  to  obtain  calibrated  band 
locations: a centroid method with band fraction of 0.5 and a band minimum determination method.  Both methods 
have  been  applied  to  spectra  in  wavenumbers.    Wavelength  values  can  be  obtained  from  the  wavenumber  values 
through the relationship λν = 1, where λ is the wavelength in cm.  The user can select either Tables 1 and 2 if they 
apply the centroid (with band fraction of 0.5) method, or Tables 3 and 4 if they apply any method designed to obtain 
the band minimum. 
 
 
Centroid Method 
 
The original  method used to determine the band  wavenumber (ν) and wavelength (λ) values of SRM 192la is the 
centroid (also known as the center of gravity) method [9,10].  This procedure is performed on the transmittance spectra 
using wavenumber values only.  The wavenumber value is defined as the number of waves per unit length (cm).  Refer 
to Figure 2 when using the following band determination procedure. 
 
First,  the  bounds  of  an  initial  wavenumber  range  (νmin  to  νmax)  enclosing  the  band  are  determined;  they  are  the 
Next,  the  differences 
wavenumber values at which transmittance relative maxima occur on either side of the band.  Next, the differences 
between the transmittance values at each bound and the transmittance at the band minimum, 
 

1. 

∆T(νmax)  =  [T(ν max)  –  T(ν band min)] and ∆T(ν min)  =  [T(νmin)  –  T(ν band min)], 

 
are determined.  Then half the value of the smaller of ∆T(νmax) and ∆T(νmin), ∆To/2 is determined.  The wavenumber 
range (ν1 to ν2) to be used in the centroid calculation is that between the wavenumber values where the transmittance 
values on either side of the band equal the minimum transmittance value plus ∆To/2,

Band Minimum Determination Method 
 
A recently developed method was designed and applied to accurately determine the band minimum (or maximum) 
value to obtain calibration values for SRM 1921a.  This method is called the extrapolated centroid method [11,12].  It 
entails the calculation of centroid values for a set of fractions (approaching zero fraction) of the band and extrapolating 
a curve fit through the set of values to a value for zero fraction that corresponds to the band minimum (or maximum).  
Results of any method designed to find the band minimum should produce essentially the same result and hence be 
directly comparable [5,13]. 
 
Correction for Air/Nitrogen Purge:  The NIST certification measurements were performed in vacuum.  Hence, the 
wavelength values reported in Table 1 are vacuum values where the index of refraction, n, equals one.  For instruments 
that operate under vacuum, calibration measurements of SRM 192la can be directly compared to values in Table l.  
Also, for instruments that give vacuum wavenumber and wavelength values (such as Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) 
spectrometers which use helium-neon lasers for determination of the wavenumber scale) even when operated under 
air or purge gas, no corrections are necessary.   
 
In all other cases when measurements of SRM 1921a are made under air, nitrogen, or other purge gas, the wavenumber 
and wavelength values need to be adjusted for the index of refraction of the gas (n = 1.000 26 for dry nitrogen gas at 
atmospheric pressure and T = 298 K) [14,15].  Thus, for nitrogen purge, the measured wavenumber values should be 
divided by 1.000 26, and the wavelength values should be multiplied by 1.000 26 to compare to the certified values 
in Table l. 
 
 
Corrections to Instrument Wavenumber Scale:  The resulting N (N ≥ 6) values for each peak at wavenumber, ν, 
should be averaged to obtain a single band wavenumber value (laboratory mean, y
ν), and the standard deviation of the 
values, sν, should be calculated.  In order to determine  whether the laboratory measurements are biased relative to 
SRM 1921a, calculate the difference, δν, between the laboratory mean, y
 

ν, and the certified value, Cν, as follows:

A practical limit for evaluating consistency with the certified value is:

where tN-1 0.95 is the critical value from the student's distribution with N – 1 degrees of freedom for a two-sided 95 % 
confidence interval [16] and U [1,2] is the uncertainty from Table 2.  For example, if N = 6, then t5 0.95 = 2.571.  If 
δν > |δc|, then the difference is greater than can be explained by chance, and the wavenumber scale of the instrument 
should be corrected to the SRM.  If this is the case, generally a linear least squares fit of δν to ν for the 13 peaks should 
provide a sufficient correction to the spectrophotometer scale.  However, if δν ≤ |δc|, the wavenumber scale of the 
spectrophotometer is considered to be accurate and correction is not advised.
