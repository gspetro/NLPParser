Standard  Reference  Material  1818a 

Chlorine  in  Lubricating  Base  Oils 

This  Standard  Reference  Matertal  (SRM)  is  intended  for  use  as  an  analytical  standard  far  the  determination  of  total 
chiorine  in  lubricating  base  oils  or  matcrials  of  similar  composition.  SRM  18182  consists  of  a  series  of  five  20  mL 
ampules  of  lubricating  base  oils  at  different  chlorine  concentrations.

The  chlorine  certified  values  in  SRM  18182  were  established  using  instrumental]  neutron  activation  analysis  (INAA}. 
Homogeneity  testing  perfonned  using  X-ray  Nuorescence  spectroscopy  (XRF)  did  not  show  significant  material 
variance,  while  INAA  certification  analyses  did  detect  possible  material  heterogeneity. 

The  uncertainty  was  calculated  according  to  NIST  Technical  Note  1297,  "Guidelines  for  Evaluating  and  Expressing 
Uncertainty  of  NIST  Measurement  Results”.  {{]  The  expanded  uncertainty  given  includes  both  analytical  uncertainty 
and  possible  material  hetcragencity,  and  is  at  the  95%  level  of  confidence. 

Stability  and  Storage: 
The 
ampules  should  be  stored  in  a  cool  and  dark  place,  Any  ampule  observed  to  contain  sediment  should  be  discarded. 

The  certification  of  SRM  18182  is  valid  for  three  years  from  date  of  purchase, 

INAA  analyses  for  certification  were  performed  by  L.  Tandon  and  D.A.  Becker,  of  the  NIST  Inarganic  Analytical 
Research  Division  and  XRF  analyses  were  performed  by  P.T.  Pei,  of  the  NIST  Ceramic  Division,  The  production 
of  tis  SRM  was  coordinated  by  P.T.  Pei. 

The  statistical  analysis  of  the  certification  data  was  performed  by  $.B.  Schiller,  of  the  NIST  Statistical  Engineering 
Division. 

The  technical  and  support  aspects  involved  in  the  preparation,  certification,  and  issuance  of  this  SRM  were 
coordinated  by  T.E.  Gills  and  J.S.  Kane  through  the  Standard  Reference  Materials  Program.

The  uncertainty  of  the  certified  value  dees  not  reflect  the  expected  precision  of  a  future  measurement  by  X-ray 
fluorescence  spectroscopy  (XRF)  (2);  therefore,  a  table  providing  the  expected  precision  of  a  single  measurement 
(at  the  95%  confidence  level)  is  given.  Assuming  the  measurement  process  is  under  control,  a  future  measurement 
should  fall  within  this  uncertainty  of  the  certified  valuc.
