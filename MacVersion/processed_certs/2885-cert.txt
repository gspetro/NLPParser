g/mol) 
(Mass-Average Molar Mass [Mw] 6 280 g/mol) 
 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended primarily for use in calibration and performance evaluation of 
instruments used to determine molar mass, previously expressed as molecular weight [1], and molar mass distribution 
by size exclusion chromatography.  A unit of SRM 2885 consists of approximately 0.3 g of polyethylene powder.   
 
Certified  Values  and  Uncertainty:    The  certified  value  for  Mw  was  measured  using  static  light  scattering  with 
1-chloronaphthalene as the solvent at 130 °C [2].  The certified value for the intrinsic viscosity was determined in 
1,2,4-trichlorobenzene at 130 °C.  The certified values and uncertainties for mass-average molar mass and intrinsic 
viscosity are presented in Table 1.

Property 

Certified Value 

Mass-Average Molar Mass (Mw) 

6.28 x 103 g/mol  ±  0.56 x 103 g/mol 

Intrinsic Viscosity [η]  

22.3 mL/g  ±  0.20 mL/g 

 
The certified measurement uncertainty is expressed as a combined expanded uncertainty with a coverage factor, k = 2, 
calculated in accordance with NIST procedure [3].  Type A and Type B contributions to the expanded uncertainty of 
the  measured  mass-average  molar  mass  include  the  uncertainties  in  the  Rayleigh  ratio  of  the  scattering  standard, 
optical alignment, and calibration of the differential refractometer.  The measurands are mass-average molar mass and 
intrinsic viscosity.  The certified values are metrologically traceable to the SI unit of mass expressed as grams per 
mole, and to the SI unit of viscosity expressed as milliliters per gram, respectively. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 2885 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until  01 June 2020,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  given  in  this 
certificate (see “Instructions for Storage”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, or 
otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST will  notify  the  purchaser.  
Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Technical coordination leading to the certification of this SRM was provided by B.M. Fanconi of the NIST Materials 
Science and Engineering Division.  Technical measurements and data interpretation were provided by C.M. Guttman, 
of the NIST Materials Science and Engineering Division, and J.R. Maurey, W.R. Blair, and C.R. Schultheisz formerly 
of the NIST Polymers Division.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE 
 
The SRM should be stored in the original bottle with the lid tightly closed under normal laboratory conditions. 
 
Homogeneity and Characterization:  The homogeneity of SRM 2885 was tested by size exclusion chromatography 
ribed  in 
analysis  of  solutions  in  1,2,4-trichlorobenzene  at  130 °C.    The  characterization  of  this  polymer  is  described  in 
reference 2.  SRM 2885 is the result of a clean-up, blending, and rebottling of the fractionation of SRM 1475.  It was 
produced in the same fractionation as SRM 1482, SRM 1483, and SRM 1484 [4].
