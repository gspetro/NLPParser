Cemented  Carbide 

(W-75,Co-9,Ta-5,Ti-4) 

(In  Cooperation  with  the  American  Society  for  Testing  and  Materials) 

This  Standard  Reference  Material  (SRM)  is  a  sintered  tungsten  carbide  base  material  in  the  form  of  a  fine  powder 
(150  ym)  intended  for  use  in  checking  chemical  and  instrumental  methods  of  analysis.  SRM  889  was  developed 
under  the  cooperative  program  for  certification  with  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology  (NIST) 
and  the  American  Society  for  Testing  and  Materials  (ASTM).

4  The  certified  value  is  the  present  best  estimate  of  the  "true"  value  based  on  the  NIST/ASTM  cooperative  program  for  certification. 

b  The  estimated  uncertainty  is  based  on  judgment  and  represents  an  evaluation  of  the  combined  effects  of  method i imprecision,  possible  sys- 
tematic  errors  among  methods,  and  material  variability.  No  attempt  was  made  to  derive  exact  statistical  measures  of imprecision  because  several 
methods  were  involved in  the  determination  of  the  certified  constituent.

The  technical  and  support  aspects  involved  in  the  preparation,  certification,  and  issuance  of  this  Standard  Reference 
Material  were  coordinated  through  the  Office  of  Standard  Reference  Materials  by  W.P.  Reed. 

PLANNING,  PREPARATION,  TESTING,  AND  ANALYSIS: 

The  material  for  this  SRM  was  provided  by  GTE  Products  Corp.,  Towanda,  Pennsylvania  through  the  courtesy  of 
R.  Dyck. 

The  preparation  of  the  material  was  under  the  direction  of  M.E.  Shaffer  of  the  Hard  Materials  Section,  GTE 
Products  Corp.,  Towanda,  Pennsylvania. 

Homogeneity  testing  was  performed  at  GTE  Products  Corp.  by  J.S.  Mras  and  at  NIST  by  G.A.  Sleater. 

Cooperative  analyses  for  certification  were  performed  in  the  following  laboratories:
