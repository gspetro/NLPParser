Phthalates in Polyvinyl Chloride  

 
This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  use  in  validating  methods  for  determining  six 
phthalate  esters  in  polyvinyl  chloride (PVC).    The  phthalates  esters  are  di-n-butyl  phthalate (DnBP),  benzyl  butyl 
phthalate (BBP), bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), di-n-octyl phthalate (DnOP), diisononyl phthalate (DINP), and 
diisodecyl  phthalate (DIDP).    A  unit  of  SRM 2860  consists  of  shredded  material  as  follows:    one  jar  containing 
approximately 2 g of BLANK (PVC) with no phthalates added; and two jars each containing approximately 2 g of 
Level I (Nominal Concentration 0.1 % Phthalates in PVC) and Level II (Nominal Concentration 2 % Phthalates in 
PVC) respectively, for a total of three jars. 
 
NIST  has 
Certified Values:  Certified values are provided in Table 1.  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has 
the highest confidence in its accuracy, in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been taken into account [1].  
The certified values are metrologically traceable to the SI derived unit of mass fraction (expressed as micrograms per 
gram).

INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE AND USE  

Figure 1.  Molar Mass Distributions of Select PVC Samples 

Handling and storage:  Until required for use, SRM 2860 should be stored in the dark at room temperature but not 
above  30 °C.    A  recommended  minimum  sample  size  of  0.1 g  can  be  generated  by  cutting  pieces  from  the  PVC 
shredded materials using a razor blade or scalpel. 

Use:  SRM 2860 is provided as a suite of three matrix shredded materials for validating measurements of six phthalates 
in PVC.  
 
NOTICE AND WARNING TO USERS 
 
Warning:    The  shredded  materials  composing  SRM 2860  should  be  handled  with  cloth  or  nitrile  gloves.    These 
materials are potentially flammable and should be kept away from open flame. 
 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS(1 
 
Material Formulation and Processing:  This SRM was formulated and milled at BASF (Pasadena, TX), producing 
6 to 9 sheets of the three levels of phthalate plasticizers in PVC.  These sheets were subdivided and packaged at NIST 
(Gaithersburg, MD).  Solutions of the six phthalate esters in bis(2-ethylhexyl) adipate (DOA) were prepared at NIST 
after consulting with D. Owen (BASF).  These solutions were used to achieve intended phthalate mass fractions in the 
PVC sheets of 0 % (DOA neat with no phthalates added), 0.1 % phthalates, and 2 % phthalates in PVC from batch 
formulations  of  300 g  vinyl  resin  (Oxy 240F),  150 g  plasticizer  (phthalates  in  DOA),  and  9 g  heat  stabilizer 
(Baerlocher 1760A). 
 
After  combining  and  manually  mixing  the  components  for  5 min,  the  formulations  were  further  mixed  using  a 
professional grade metal food processor for 2 min, 2 min, and 11 min. Oxy 240F is a suspension resin.  This type of 
resin  absorbs  the  liquid  plasticizer  to  form  a  “dry  blend”.    These  PVC  formulations  would  require  the  phthalate 
solutions used in the 0.1 % phthalates in PVC to have phthalate mass fraction concentrations of 0.305 % in DOA, and 
the solutions used in the 2 % phthalates in PVC preparation to have phthalate mass fraction concentrations of 6.21 % 
in DOA.  The phthalate solutions and DOA with no phthalates added were shipped to BASF’s Pasadena, TX facility 
on September 19, 2013.  The PVC sheets were milled using a LabTech Engineering Co. LTD (Thailand) Two Roll 
Mill.  The mill’s counter-rotating rollers, heated at approximately 172 °C, fused the dry blend into flexible sheets of 
approximately 450 g each. From 6 to 9 individual PVC sheets were milled each for the 0.1 % phthalate, 2 % phthalate, 
and 0 % phthalate (100 % DOA) formulations.  The PVC sheets were shipped to NIST.

Processing  of  the  PVC  sheets  involved  cutting  them  into  strips  approximately  20 cm  wide,  freezing  the  sheets 
to -80 °C, and shredding with a heavy-duty cross-cutting paper shredder.  The resulting segments of the PVC shredded 
materials were packaged in 10 mL amber vials in 2 g to 2.5 g masses. 
 
NIST  Analytical  Approaches  for  Determination  of  six  phthalates  in  PVC  materials:    Sampling  of  the  PVC 
samples involved cutting small pieces of the shredded PVC using a solvent-cleaned stainless steel scalpel for the 0.1 g 
aliquots and combining multiple pieces until their masses totaled approximately 1 g (accurately determined) for the 
1 g samplings.  The method employed for this work [3] involved spiking the 0 %, and 0.1 % phthalates in PVC samples 
with known masses of benzyl benzoate followed by dissolution of the PVC matrices with THF (for example, 10 mL 
for 0.1 g PVC sample size) using sonication (5 to 10) min, after which the polymer resin was precipitated with hexanes 
(20 mL for 0.1 g PVC sample size).  For 1 g sample aliquots, the dissolution solvents were scaled up to 65 mL THF 
and 130 mL hexanes.  Aliquots of the supernate of the samples were then passed through 0.45 μm syringe filters into 
2 mL  amber  glass  vials.    A  spiked  blank  and  calibrants  were  prepared  with  each  set  of  samples.    Quadruplicate 
extractions were performed for the 0 % and 0.1 % phthalate materials. 
 
For the NIST Method 1 gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) measurements, 1 μL aliquots were injected 
onto a 60 m x 0.25 mm (inner diameter), 0.25 μm phase, 50 % phenylmethyl-substituted polysiloxane, with helium at 
a constant flow of 1.5 mL min-1.  The GC temperature program began at 66 °C for a 1 min hold then increased at 
50 °C min-1 to 150 °C then 5 °C min-1 to 300 °C for a 15 min hold.  The interface, source and quadrupole temperatures 
were set at 300 °C, 200 °C, and 150 °C, respectively.  For Method 1, selected ions were monitored for benzyl benzoate 
[mass/charge (m/z) 105], di-n-butyl phthalate (m/z 223), benzyl butyl phthalate (m/z 206), bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate 
(m/z 279), di-n-octyl phthalate (m/z 279), diisononyl phthalate (m/z 293), and diisodecyl phthalate (m/z 307). 
 
The GC/MS measurements using Method 2 began with a 0.5 μL to 1.0 μL splitless injection at a temperature of 275 °C 
(0.80 min splitless time), a constant flow of helium of 1.5 mL min-1, an oven temperature program beginning at 150 °C 
for a 1 min hold followed by a 5 °C min-1 ramp to 300 °C for a 15 min hold.  The mass spectrometer’s source and 
interface  were both set at 300 °C and the Q3 quadrupoles were scanned from  m/z 40 to m/z 550. For SRM 2860, 
reconstructed ion chromatograms for benzyl benzoate (m/z 105), di-n-butyl phthalate (m/z 149), benzyl butyl phthalate 
(m/z 149), bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (m/z 149), di-n-octyl phthalate (m/z 149), diisononyl phthalate (m/z 293), and 
diisodecyl  phthalate  (m/z  307)  were  used  to  generate  peaks  and  associated  areas  for  the  quantification  of  the  six 
phthalates. 
 
CPSC Analytical Approach for Determination of six phthalates in PVC materials:  The CPSC laboratory used 
the same spiking and extraction procedures of the PVC shredded materials as described above [3].  In addition, the 
CPSC performed nine extractions for 0.05 mg aliquots of the 0.1 % nine and eight extractions for the 0.05 g samplings 
of the 2 % materials.  CPSC also performed nine extractions each for the 0.1 g aliquots of the 0.1 % and 2 % materials 
and three extractions each for the 1 g samples of the two materials. 
 
The GC/MS measurements involved a 1.0 μL splitless injection at a temperature of 290 °C (0.80 min splitless time), 
a constant flow of helium of 1.0 mL min-1, an oven temperature beginning at 50 °C for a 1 min hold followed by a 
30 °C min-1 ramp to 280 °C then a 15 °C-1 ramp 310 °C for a 4 min hold.  The same ions were monitored as those for 
NIST Method 1 (above).  The interface, source, and quadrupole temperatures were set at 320 °C, 200 °C, and 150 °C, 
respectively. 
 
Diablo Analytical and Frontier Laboratories Analytical Approaches for Determination of six phthalates in PVC 
materials:  These laboratories performed measurements of phthalates in the Level II material (2 % phthalates in PVC) 
using  an  external  calibration  and  standard  addition  procedure  followed  by  thermal  desorption  (TD)-GC/MS [4].  
20 mg PVC/mL solutions of the Level II material were prepared by dissolving in THF.  These solutions were then 
diluted by a factor of five, resulting in 0.5 mg PVC/mL solutions from which 10 µL aliquots were sampled, spiked 
with known amounts of a phthalate standard (for the standard addition procedure), dried at 50 °C and analyzed by 
TD-GC/MS.  Thermal desorption took place during a 100 °C - 320 °C thermal ramp at 20 °C/min with a 5 min hold 
at  the  final  temperature.    The  GC/MS  measurements  involved  a  split  injection  onto  a  30 m x 0.25 mm  i.d.  Ultra 
ALLOY-5 column (0.25 μm film) at a temperature of 320 °C, a constant  flow of helium of 1.2mL min-1, an oven 
temperature beginning at 80 °C for a 1 min hold followed by a 50 °C min-1 ramp to 200 °C then a 15 °C-1 ramp 320 °C 
for a 2 min hold.  The MS was scanned from m/z 29 to m/z 600, with the same ions used as those specified in NIST 
Method 1 (above) for quantitation of the six phthalates.  The interface, source and quadrupole temperatures were set 
at 320 °C, 230 °C, and 150 °C, respectively. 
 
NIST Analytical Approaches for Characterization of the PVC Matrix (Table 5 and Figure 1, above):  For size-
exclusion chromatography (SEC) analysis, the precursor PVC (Oxy 240F) was dissolved in THF (high performance 
liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade) at a concentration of 2.3 mg mL-1.  Punches (diameter from 4 to 5 mm) from 
the PVC sheets were weighed (mass range of punches was from 16.6 mg to 41.3 mg) and dissolved in 10 mL of THF.  

SRM 2860 

Page 5 of 6 

Thus,  the  concentration  of  the  samples  varied  between  1.66 mg mL-1  and  4.13 mg mL-1.    The  critical  overlap 
concentration (c*) of PVC, which was determined from the intrinsic viscosity data of the precursor PVC (inverse of 
intrinsic viscosity of the highest molar mass species in the sample), was 5.3 mg mL-1.  Before SEC analysis, all the 
samples were allowed to dissolve and solvate overnight, with mixing by occasional gentle inversion.  Two punches 
were obtained from each sheet, and two SEC injections were performed from the solution of each punch. 
 
The multi-detector SEC instrument consisted of an HPLC pump, a manual injector with 100 μL injection loop, a multi-
angle  static  light  scattering  detector (MALS),  a  quasi-elastic  light  scattering (QELS)  detector,  a  differential 
viscometer (VISC), and differential refractive index (DRI) detector.  The delay reservoir volume in the viscometer 
was 27 mL.  The columns used were three PLgel 10 μm-particle size columns connected in series.  The columns and 
detectors  were  temperature-regulated  to  25 °C.    The  normalization  of  MALS  detector,  and  determination  of 
interdetector delays and interdetector band broadening, was accomplished using a narrow dispersity (Mw/Mn ≤ 1.06) 
polystyrene with nominal Mw of 30000 g mol-1.  THF was used as eluent.
