Standard Reference Material® 3280 
 
Multivitamin/Multielement Tablets 

 
validating  analytical  methods  for  the 
This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  use  in  validating  analytical  methods  for  the 
determination of vitamins, carotenoids, and elements in dietary supplement tablets and similar matrices.  This SRM 
can  also be  used  for quality  assurance when  assigning  values  to  in-house  control  materials.   A unit  of  SRM 3280 
consists of five bottles, each containing 30 tablets.  The SRM is provided as whole tablets because some of the vitamins 
are  coated  or  encapsulated  to  provide  stability  and  grinding  would  compromise  this  coating.    Each  tablet  weighs 
approximately 1.5 g. 
 
The  development  of  SRM 3280  was  a  collaboration  between  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and 
Technology (NIST) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS). 
 
Values were derived from the combination of results provided by NIST and collaborating laboratories.  The certified and 
reference values in this material are the equally weighted means of the individual sets of NIST results and the means of 
the individual sets of measurements made by collaborating laboratories, as available.  The associated uncertainties are 
expanded uncertainties at the 95 % level of confidence, as described below [1–4].  Values are reported on a dry-mass 
basis in mass fraction units [5]. 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values:  The certified mass fraction values of selected vitamins, carotenoids, and elements 
are provided in Tables 1 and 2.  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its 
accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [6]. 
 
Reference Mass Fraction Values:  Reference mass fraction values for additional vitamins, carotenoids, and elements 
are provided in Tables 3 and 4.  Reference values are noncertified values that are the best estimate of the true values 
based on available data; however, the values do not meet the NIST criteria for certification [6] and are provided with 
associated uncertainties that may reflect only measurement reproducibility, may not include all sources of uncertainty, 
or may reflect a lack of sufficient statistical agreement among multiple analytical methods. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 3280 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until  31 October 2021,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  instructions  given  in  this 
certificate (see “Warning and Instructions for Storage and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, 
contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
icate,  NIST  will  notify  the
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Support  for  the  development  of  SRM 3280  was  provided  in  part  by  the  NIH-ODS.    Technical  consultation  was 
provided by J.M. Betz of NIH-ODS. 
 
Coordination of the technical measurements leading to the certification of this SRM was performed by L.C. Sander 
and  S.A. Wise  of  the  NIST  Chemical  Sciences  Division  and  K.E. Sharpless  of  the  Special  Programs  Office.  
Acquisition of the material was coordinated by K.E. Sharpless. 
 
Statistical analysis was provided by J.H. Yen of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division.

WARNING AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE AND USE 
 
Warning:  For research use.  Not for human consumption.  Individual tablets should not be analyzed because of 
tablet-to-tablet  variability.    The  variation  of  measured  element  mass  fractions  from  tablet  to  tablet  ranges  from 
approximately 15 % to 25 %, therefore instructions for use (below) must be followed. 
 
Storage:  The material should be stored at controlled room temperature (20 °C to 25 °C), in an unopened bottle, until 
required for use.  Freshly ground powder was observed to gain an average of 0.075 % of its original mass in 3 h after 
grinding.  After 24 h, the average gain was 0.11 % at 44 % relative humidity and a temperature of 21 °C.  Vitamins are 
stable for at least 4 d following opening of the bottle; some vitamins have been observed to be unstable in ground material 
but this instability has not been fully investigated.  Use of a freshly ground portion for vitamin analyses is recommended. 
 
Use:  At least 15 tablets must be ground to obtain a homogeneous sample prior to removal of a test portion for analysis.  
NIST analysts used two methods to grind tablets to a powder prior to analysis: (1) thirty tablets were ground in a disk 
mill, which involved shaking in an orbital pattern for 6 min, (2) batches of 15, 20, or 30 tablets were ground for 10 min 
using an automated mortar and pestle.  (Note that 6 min of shaking in a disk mill did not grind the tablets, particularly 
the coating material, as finely as did the other technique.)  For certified values to be valid, test portions of the powder 
equal to or greater than 0.6 g to 2 g for carotenoids and fat-soluble vitamins, 0.3 g to 2 g for water-soluble vitamins, 
and 0.25 g to 4.5 g for elements should be used.  Test portions should be analyzed as received and results converted 
to a dry-mass basis by determining moisture content (described below) on a separate test portion. 
 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS(1) 

Material  Acquisition  and  Preparation:    A  manufacturer  of  multivitamin/multielement  tablets  prepared  a 
non-commercial  batch  of  tablets  according  to  their  normal  procedure.    SRM 3280  is  a  direct-compression  tablet 
formulation  produced  by  blending  a  vitamin  and  a  mineral  pre-mix  with  the  remaining  bulk  of  the  formulation, 
compression,  and  tablet  film  coating.    Fat-soluble  vitamins  and  carotenoids  (retinyl  acetate,  β-carotene,  lutein, 
ergocalciferol, and dl-α-tocopheryl acetate) were added as gelatin beadlets.  The film  coating consisted of triethyl 
citrate, polysorbate 80, yellow #6 aluminum-lake, hypromellose, and titanium dioxide. 
 
Analytical Approach for Determination of Vitamins and Carotenoids:  Value assignment of the mass fractions of 
the vitamins and carotenoids in SRM 3280 was based on the combination of measurements from several different 
analytical methods at NIST and USDA and in two interlaboratory comparison exercises involving the GMA FIACC 
                                                 
(1)Certain  commercial  equipment,  instruments,  or  materials  are  identified  in  this  certificate  to  adequately  specify  the 
 
ate 
experimental procedure.  Such identification does not imply recommendation or endorsement by the National Institute of Standards 
National  Institute  of  Standards
and Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the purpose.

extraction  was 

isocratic  LC method  with 

and  CEN  laboratories [7].    NIST  provided  measurements  by  using  a  combination  of  liquid  chromatography (LC) 
methods  with  different  detection  methods,  i.e.,  evaporative  light  scattering  detection (ELSD)  and  mass 
spectrometry (MS),  positive-ion  and  negative-ion  MS/MS,  and  absorbance  detection (abs),  as  described  below.  
USDA  used  LC/abs,  LC/fluorescence,  and  LC/MS  for  measurement  of  water-soluble  vitamins.    GMA  and  CEN 
laboratories  used  their  usual  methods.    Methods  used  for  measurement  of  vitamins  and  carotenoids  are  listed  in 
Table A1. 
 
NIST Analyses  for  Carotenoids  and  Fat-Soluble Vitamins:   Vitamin E  (as  α-tocopheryl  acetate)  and  vitamin K 
(phylloquinone  or  phytonadione)  were  measured  by  using  a  combination  of  LC/abs  and  LC/MS  methods,  and 
carotenoids (lutein,  cis-β-carotene,  and  trans-β-carotene)  were  measured  by  using  two  LC/abs  methods [8,9]; 
vitamin A (measured  as  retinyl  acetate  and  reported  as  retinol  equivalents)  and  vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol)  were 
he 
measured at NIST using LC/MS [9].  Calibrants were prepared gravimetrically at levels intended to approximate the 
nd
levels of the analytes in the SRM.  Internal standards were employed; a single solution was used for the calibrants and 
samples. 
 
for  Measurement  of  Retinyl  Acetate,  α-Tocopheryl  Acetate,  Ergocalciferol,  and 
LC/MS  Detection 
Phylloquinone (Phytonadione).    Tablets  were  ground  as  described  above  in  “Warning  and  Instructions  for  
Storage  and  Use”.    Single  0.6 g  portions  of  the  powder  from  each  of  six  bottles  were  combined  with 
ethylenediaminetetracetic acid (EDTA) solution and held at 45 °C to dissolve the gel encapsulation of some of the 
fat-soluble vitamins.  An internal standard solution containing retinyl acetate-d6, vitamin K1-d4, or vitamin D2-d3, was 
added and samples were placed in an ultrasonicating bath for 10 min.  Analytes were extracted into hexane by shaking 
a 
five 
overnight. 
methanol/acetonitrile (ACN)/ammonium  acetate  mobile  phase  and  a  polymeric  C18 column  were  used  for  LC/MS 
determination of the fat-soluble vitamins.  The separation was monitored at 287 nm, and MS was used for quantitation.  
A typical separation is provided in Appendix B [9]. 
 
LC/abs for Measurement of Carotenoids, Retinyl Acetate, and α-Tocopheryl Acetate – Method 1.  Tablets were ground 
as described above.  Two 2 g portions of the powder from each of six bottles were combined with dilute hydrochloric 
acid and were placed in a 37 °C ultrasonicating bath for about 25 min with intermittent manual shaking.  An internal 
standard solution (δ-tocopherol) was added to each sample, and samples were returned to the ultrasonicating bath for 
an additional 5 min.  Analytes were extracted into hexane by shaking overnight.  At least three subsequent extractions 
into hexane were performed (1 h on the shaker) until the organic layer was colorless.  Hexane layers were combined, 
and  10 mL  extract  was  removed,  evaporated  to  dryness  under  nitrogen,  and  reconstituted  in  ethanol  containing 
butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT).  An isocratic LC method with a methanol/triethylamine (TEA)/ACN mobile phase 
and  a  polymeric  C18 column  held  at  25 °C  were  used  for  the  determination  of  carotenoids,  retinyl  acetate,  and 
α-tocopheryl acetate, with absorbance measured at 450 nm, 325 nm, and 284 nm, respectively.  The absorbance of the 
internal standard, δ-tocopherol, was measured at 284 nm.  A typical separation is provided in Appendix B [8].  (Note 
that this method was used for determination of the mass fraction of retinyl acetate and its homogeneity on the original 
certificate dated 14 January 2009.  Results obtained by using this method were not used when the reference value for 
retinol was updated in 2011.) 
 
LC/abs Detection for Measurement of Carotenoids – Methods 2a and 2b.  Tablets were ground as described above.  
Approximately 0.6 g portions of the powder from each of eight bottles were combined with an EDTA solution and an 
internal standard solution, containing either trans-β-apo-8’-carotenal or trans-β-apo-10’-carotenal oxime, and held at 
45 °C to dissolve gel encapsulation.  Analytes were then extracted into hexane for 60 min five times, and the extracts 
were combined.  For Method 2a, a C30 carotenoid column and water/ammonium acetate/acetone gradient were used 
for  the  determination  of  lutein  with  absorbance  measured  at  450 nm.    For  Method 2b,  a  C18 column  and  an 
ACN/methanol  (containing  ammonium  acetate)/ethyl  acetate  gradient  were  used  for  the  determination  of  cis-  and 
trans-β-carotene at 450 nm.  Typical separations are provided in Appendix B [8]. 
 
NIST  Analyses  for  Water-Soluble  Vitamins:    Water-soluble  vitamins,  including  vitamin B1  (thiamine  HCl), 
vitamin B2 (riboflavin), vitamin B3 (niacinamide), vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid), vitamin B6 (pyridoxine HCl), folic 
acid, biotin, cyanocobalamin, and vitamin C (ascorbic acid), were measured by using combinations of two LC methods 
with  absorbance  detection,  ELSD,  MS,  MS/MS,  or  inductively  coupled  plasma  mass  spectrometry (ICP-MS).  
Calibrants were prepared gravimetrically at levels intended to approximate the levels of the vitamins in the SRM.  In 
cases where an internal standard was employed, a single solution was used for the calibrants and samples. 
 
LC/abs for Analysis of Vitamins B1, B2, B6, C, and Niacinamide.  Tablets were ground as described above in “Warning 
and Instructions for Storage and Use”.  Vitamins B1, B2, B6, C, and niacinamide were measured by LC/abs in single 
2 g test  portions  taken  from  each  of  six  bottles.    Test  portions  were  combined  with  HCl,  and  an  internal  solution 
containing 4-pyridoxic acid was added.  The mixture was sonicated and centrifuged, and a portion of the supernatant 
was removed and filtered prior to analysis.  A gradient LC method with potassium phosphate dibasic buffer and ACN

and  a  C18 column  were  used  with  absorbance  detection  at  260 nm  for  vitamins B1, B6, C,  and  niacinamide,  and  at 
266 nm for vitamin B2.  A typical separation is provided in Appendix C. 
 
LC/MS for Analysis of Vitamins B1, B2, B6, Niacinamide, and Pantothenic Acid.  Vitamins B1, B2, B6, niacinamide, 
and pantothenic acid were measured by LC/MS in two 0.25 g test portions taken from each of six bottles.  Four internal 
standards were added:  13C3-thiamine chloride, 2H4-niacinamide, 13C3,15N-calcium pantothenate, and 13C4-pyridoxine 
HCl.   The  analytes  and  internal  standards were  extracted  into dilute  acetic  acid for  analysis  by  positive-ion  mode 
LC/MS.  A gradient LC method with an ammonium formate buffer/methanol mobile phase and a C18 column were 
used for determination of B1, B2, B6, niacinamide, and pantothenic acid.  Transitions were measured at:  m/z 265 for 
thiamine, m/z 268 for 13C3-thiamine, m/z 123 for niacinamide, m/z 127 for 2H4-niacinamide, m/z 220 for pantothenic 
acid, m/z 224 for 13C3,15N-pantothenic acid, m/z 170 for pyridoxine and m/z 174 for 13C4-pyridoxine.  The transition 
for riboflavin was measured at m/z 377, with 13C4-pyridoxine as the internal standard.  A typical separation is provided 
in Appendix C [9]. 
 
Folic  acid 
Negative-Ion  Mode  LC/MS/MS  for  Analysis  of  Folic  Acid.    Tablets  were  ground  as  described  above.    Folic  acid 
measurements were made on two 0.3 g test portions taken from each of six bottles.  An internal standard, 13C5-folic 
acid,  was  added.    The  internal  standard  and  folic  acid  were  extracted  into  water  containing  dithiothreitol  and 
ammonium hydroxide for negative-ion mode LC/MS/MS.  A gradient LC method with a water/methanol/acetic acid 
mobile  phase  and  a  pentafluorylphenyl  column  were  used.    The  transitions  at  m/z 440 → m/z 311 (folic  acid)  and 
m/z 445 → m/z 311 (13C5-folic acid) were monitored [10]. 
 
Positive-Ion  Mode  LC/MS/MS  for  Analysis  of  Folic  Acid.    Tablets  were  ground  as  described  above.    Folic  acid 
Folic  acid
measurements were made on two 0.3 g test portions taken from each of six bottles.  An internal standard, 13C5-folic 
acid,  was  added.    The  internal  standard  and  folic  acid  were  extracted  into  a  methanol/water  mixture  containing 
dithiothreitol for positive-ion mode LC/MS/MS.  A gradient LC method with a water/methanol/formic acid mobile 
phase  and  a  pentafluorylphenyl  column  were  used.    The  transitions  at  m/z  442 → m/z 295 (folic  acid)  and 
m/z 447 → m/z 295 (13C5-folic acid) were monitored [10]. 
 
LC/MS for Analysis of Biotin.  Tablets were ground as described above.  Biotin was measured in two 1.5 g test portions 
taken from each of six bottles.   2H2-biotin was added as an internal standard, and the analytes were extracted into 
methanol [11].  An isocratic LC method with a water/methanol/formic acid mobile phase and a C18 column were used.  
Transitions for biotin and 2H2-biotin were measured at m/z 245 and m/z 247, respectively. 
 
LC/ELSD for Analysis of Biotin.  Tablets were ground as described above.  Biotin was measured in two 1.5 g test 
portions  taken  from  each  of  six  bottles.    Desthiobiotin  was  added  as  an  internal  standard,  and  the  analytes  were 
extracted into an aqueous formic acid solution.  An isocratic LC method with a water/methanol/formic acid mobile 
phase and a cyanopropyl column were used for LC/ELSD determination of biotin. 
 
LC/ICP-MS  for  Analysis  of  Cyanocobalamin.    Tablets  were  ground  as  described  above.    Cyanocobalamin  was 
measured in 4.5 g test portions taken from each of ten bottles.  Water-soluble vitamins were extracted into water, and 
gallium  was  added  as  an  internal  standard.    An  isocratic  LC  method  with  a  methanol/water  mobile  phase  and  a 
C18 column  were  used  for  separation  of  cyanocobalamin  from  cobalt  and  other  extracted  constituents.  
Cyanocobalamin was measured as cobalt using LC/ICP-MS. 
 
Analytical Approach for Determination of Elements:  Value assignment of the mass fractions of the elements in 
SRM 3280 was based on the combination of measurements from several different analytical methods at NIST and in 
an interlaboratory comparison exercise involving GMA FIACC laboratories.  NIST provided measurements by using 
prompt gamma activation analysis (PGAA), instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA), radiochemical neutron 
activation analysis (RNAA), X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF), and inductively coupled plasma spectrometry 
with optical emission (ICP-OES) or ICP-MS detection with isotope dilution (ID) in some cases.  GMA laboratories 
used their usual methods.  Table A2 lists the methods used for measurement of the elements. 
 
NIST Analyses for As, B, Cd, Cu, Hg, I, K, Mo, Ni, P, Pb, Se, Sn, V, and Zn by Using ICP-OES and ICP-MS:  
Tablets were ground as described above in “Warning and Instructions for Storage and Use”.  Copper, molybdenum, 
nickel, phosphorus, potassium, vanadium, and zinc were measured by ICP-OES in duplicate test portions (0.35 g to 
0.4 g) taken from each of six bottles of SRM 3280.  Samples for ICP-OES analysis were digested in Teflon beakers 
in  nitric,  perchloric,  and  hydrofluoric  acids.    Arsenic,  boron,  iodine,  nickel,  selenium,  and  tin  were  measured  by 
ICP-MS in single test portions (0.25 g to 0.45 g) taken from each of six or ten bottles.  Except for samples in which 
iodine was measured, samples for ICP-MS and ID-ICP-MS analyses were digested in microwave systems; samples in 
which arsenic, boron, nickel, selenium, and tin were measured were digested in nitric and hydrofluoric acids, samples 
in  which  cadmium  was  measured  were  digested  in  nitric  and  hydrofluoric  acids,  and  samples  in  which  lead  was 
measured were digested in nitric acid.  Samples in which iodine was measured were digested in an alkaline solution

of  sodium  hydroxide  and  sodium  sulfite  and  were  measured  by  ICP-MS  with  standard  additions.    Cadmium  was 
isolated  from  interferences  (Mo  and  Sn,  in  particular)  by  solid-phase  extraction  and  measured  by  ID-ICP-MS  in 
collision-cell mode in single test portions (0.25 g) taken from each of ten bottles.  Lead was measured by ID-ICP-MS 
in single test portions (0.5 g) taken from each of six bottles.  Mercury was measured by using ID cold vapor ICP-MS 
(ID-CV-ICP-MS) in two 0.5 g test portions taken from a single bottle.  Samples for mercury analysis were digested 
in  a  mixture  of  nitric  acid  and  hydrogen  peroxide.    The  mass  fraction  of  mercury  was  too  low  for  quantitation.  
Quantitation for ICP-OES and non-ID-ICP-MS analyses was based on the method of standard additions. 
 
NIST Analyses for Ca, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, I, La, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Sb, Se, V, and Zn by Using INAA:  Tablets were 
ground as described above, and antimony, calcium, cobalt, chromium, copper, iodine, iron, lanthanum, magnesium, 
manganese, molybdenum, selenium, sodium, vanadium, and zinc were measured using INAA.  Individual disks were 
prepared from 0.2 g test portions taken from each of eight bottles; a duplicate was prepared from one of the bottles.  
Disks were formed using a stainless steel die and hydraulic press.  Standards were prepared by transferring a weighed 
portion  of  a  solution  containing  a  known  amount  of  each  element  onto  filter  papers  or  from  pure  elements  or 
compounds of known purity.  For analysis of short-lived nuclides (calcium, copper, iodine, magnesium, manganese, 
sodium, and vanadium), samples, standards, and controls were packaged individually in clean polyethylene bags and 
irradiated individually at 20 MW.  For analysis of long-lived nuclides (antimony, cobalt, chromium, iron, lanthanum, 
molybdenum, selenium, and zinc), samples, standards, and controls were irradiated for 3 h; irradiation capsules were 
then inverted 180º, and materials were irradiated another 3 h.  Short-lived nuclides were counted for 5 min after a 
2 min decay and again for 20 min following a 15 min decay.  For the long-lived irradiations, a 4 h count followed a 
5 d decay and an 8 h count followed a 25 d decay. 
 
NIST Analyses for B, Cl, Cu, Fe, K, and Ti by Using PGAA:  Tablets were ground as described above, and boron, 
chlorine, copper, iron, potassium, and titanium were measured by using PGAA.  Individual disks were formed from 
0.75 g test portions taken from each of six bottles and duplicate test portions taken from each of two bottles of the 
SRM.  Disks were formed using a stainless steel die and hydraulic press.  Standards were prepared by transferring a 
weighed portion of a solution containing a known amount of each element onto filter papers.  Disks were formed from 
the dried filter papers.  Samples, standards, and controls were packaged individually in clean polyethylene bags and 
irradiated individually at 20 MW, which provided a neutron fluence rate of 3.0 × 108 cm–2s–1.  The following γ-ray 
lines were used for quantitation:  477 keV line from 10B (corrected for 10B in the background and for 23N at 472 keV 
from the sample), 770 keV line from 39K, 6111 keV line from 35Cl, 341 keV and 1381 keV lines from 48Ti, 278 keV 
line from 63Cu, and 352 keV line from 56Fe. 
 
NIST Analyses for As by Using RNAA:  Tablets were ground as described above, and arsenic was measured by using 
RNAA.  Individual disks were formed from 0.2 g test portions taken from each of five bottles of the SRM.  Disks 
were formed using a stainless steel die and hydraulic press.  Standards were prepared by transferring a weighed portion 
of a solution containing a known amount of arsenic onto filter papers.  Disks were formed from the dried filter papers.  
Samples,  standards,  and  controls  were  packaged  individually  in  clean  polyethylene  bags  and  irradiated  in  one 
polyethylene irradiation vessel for 2 h at 20 MW, which provided a neutron fluence rate of 1.0 × 1014 cm–2s–1.  Samples 
and controls were combined with 77As tracer and digested in nitric and perchloric acids.  Arsenic was sequestered on 
hydrated manganese dioxide resins, which were then counted.  The 559 keV line from decay of  76As was used for 
quantitation.  The 239 keV line from decay of 77As was evaluated for yield determination. 
 
NIST Analyses for Ca, Cr, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, P, Si, and Sr by Using XRF:  Tablets were ground as described 
above,  and  calcium,  chromium,  iron,  magnesium,  manganese,  molybdenum,  phosphorus,  potassium,  silicon,  and 
strontium were measured by using XRF in duplicate or triplicate test portions of 4.5 g taken from each of six bottles. 
Samples were prepared by borate fusion, and samples were cast as 40 mm diameter beads.  (Average loss on fusion 
at 975 °C was 53.2 % of the average (as-received) mass.)  The K-L2,3 characteristic X-ray lines of calcium, chromium, 
iron, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, phosphorus, potassium, silicon, and strontium were used for quantitation.  
Sample beads were bracketed with at least four synthetic standards for calibration [12,13]. 
 
Determination of Moisture:  Moisture content of SRM 3280 was determined at NIST in ground tablets (see “Warning 
and Instructions for Storage and Use”) by (1) freeze-drying to constant mass over 8 d; (2) drying over magnesium 
perchlorate in a desiccator at room temperature for 5 d, 7 d, and 12 d; and (3) drying for 4 h in a forced-air oven at 
80 °C.  Unweighted results obtained using all three techniques were averaged to determine a conversion factor of 
(0.9863 + 0.0051) gram dry mass per gram as-received mass, which was used to convert data from an as-received to 
a dry-mass basis; the uncertainty shown on this value is an expanded uncertainty.  An uncertainty component for the 
conversion  factor (0.26 %)  obtained  from  the  moisture  measurements  is  incorporated  in  the  uncertainties  of  the 
certified and reference values, reported on a dry-mass basis, that are provided in this certificate. 
 
Homogeneity Assessment:  The homogeneity of carotenoids, retinol, and α-tocopheryl acetate was assessed at NIST 
by using the LC/abs method described above.  The homogeneity of vitamins B1, B2, B6, niacinamide, and pantothenic 

SRM 3280

acid was assessed at NIST by using the LC/MS method described above.  The homogeneity of folic acid and biotin 
was assessed at NIST using both value-assignment methods described above.  The homogeneity of various elements 
was assessed at NIST by using ICP-OES, INAA, PGAA, and XRF.  Analysis of variance did not show inhomogeneity 
for the test portions analyzed.  All measurands were treated as though they were homogeneously distributed, although 
homogeneity of all measurands was not assessed. 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values for Vitamins, Carotenoids, and Elements:  Each certified mass fraction value, 
expressed on a dry-mass basis, is an equally weighted mean of the individual sets of results provided by the individual 
NIST methods, individual means of two USDA methods, the mean of the CEN laboratories’ data, and the mean of the 
GMA data, where available.  The uncertainty in the certified value, calculated according to the method described in 
the  ISO/JCGM  Guide and  its  Supplement 1 [1–4],  is  expressed  as  an  expanded  uncertainty, U.    The  expanded 
uncertainty  is  calculated  as  U = kuc,  where  uc  is  intended  to  represent,  at  the  level  of  one  standard  deviation,  the 
combined  effect  of  between-laboratory,  within-laboratory,  and  drying  components  of  uncertainty.    The  coverage 
factor k corresponds to approximately 95 % confidence for each analyte.  The measurand is the total mass fractions of 
each vitamin, carotenoid, and element in Tables 1 and 2.  Metrological traceability to the SI derived unit for mass 
fraction (expressed as milligrams per gram, micrograms per gram, or nanograms per gram as noted in the tables).

Reference  Mass  Fraction Values  for Vitamins A  and  D,  Carotenoids  and  Elements:    Reference  mass  fraction 
values for carotenoids and elements, expressed on a dry-mass basis, are equally weighted means of the individual sets 
of results provided by the individual NIST methods, the mean of the CEN laboratories’ data, and the mean of the 
GMA data, where available.  The uncertainty in the reference values, calculated according to the method described in 
the ISO/JCGM Guide [1–3], is expressed as an expanded uncertainty, U.  The expanded uncertainty is calculated as 
U = kuc,  where  uc  is  intended  to  represent,  at  the  level  of  one  standard  deviation,  the  combined  effect  of 
within-laboratory and drying components of uncertainty.  The coverage factor (k) is determined from the Student's 
t-distribution corresponding to the appropriate associated degrees of freedom and approximately 95 % confidence for 
each analyte.  The measurand is the mass fraction of each vitamin, carotenoid, and element listed in Tables 3 and 4, as 
determined by the methods indicated.  Metrological traceability to the SI derived unit for mass fraction (expressed as 
micrograms per gram). 
 
The reference mass fraction value for vitamin A is expressed on a dry-mass basis as retinol equivalents and is the 
mean of NIST results provided using LC/MS.  The uncertainty in the reference value, calculated according to the 
method described in the ISO/JCGM Guide [1], is expressed as an expanded uncertainty, U.  The expanded uncertainty 
is calculated as U = kuc, where uc incorporates within-method uncertainty and components for the use of two different 
retinyl  acetate  absorptivities  (1535 dL/g cm  and  1560 dL/g cm)  and  for  spectrophotometric  measurement  of  the 
calibrants, and k is a coverage factor corresponding to approximately 95 % level of confidence. 
 
The reference mass fraction value for vitamin D, expressed on a dry-mass basis, is the mean of NIST results provided 
using LC/MS.  The uncertainty in the reference value is expressed as an expanded uncertainty, U calculated as U = kuc, 
where uc incorporates within-method uncertainty and a component for inhomogeneity, consistent with the ISO/JCGM 
Guide  and  its  Supplement 1 [1,3,4],  and  k  is  a  coverage  factor  corresponding  to  approximately  95 %  level  of 
confidence.  The value for vitamin D was redetermined in 2013 following questions about its stability.  The variability 
in measurements had increased since the original characterization, and a component for heterogeneity is now included 
in the assigned value.
