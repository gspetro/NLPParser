This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  use  in  validating  analytical  methods  for  the 
determination of specified constituents in maternal human serum.  This SRM can also be used for quality assurance 
when assigning values to in-house control materials.  A unit of SRM 1949 consists of two vials each of four levels, 
consisting  of  a  base  level  (non-pregnant),  and  three  pregnancy  trimester  levels  (trimester  1,  trimester  2  and 
trimester 3).  Each vial contains approximately 1.8 mL of frozen human serum. 
 
The  development  of  SRM  1949  was  a  collaboration  between  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and 
Technology (NIST),  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention (CDC),  National  Centers  for  Environmental 
Dietary 
Health 
Supplements (NIH-ODS) (Bethesda, MD).  
 
Certified Concentration Values:  Certified concentration values for the iodine hormones total thyroxine, and total 
triiodothyronine, are provided in  Table 1.  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence 
in its accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [1].  The 
certified  concentrations  were  determined  using higher-order reference  measurement  procedures [2]  calibrated  with 
high-purity  chemical  reference  standards.    The  uncertainties  are  expanded  uncertainties  at  the  95 %  level  of 
confidence [3].   
 
Reference  Concentration  Values:   Reference  concentration  values  for  copper,  selenium, zinc,  vitamin  D  binding 
protein (VDBP), 25(OH)D3, 25(OH)D2 and 3-epi-25(OH)D3 are provided in Table 2.  The reference values are based 
on results obtained from measurements at NIST and from the collaborating external laboratory.  Reference values are 
non-certified values that are the best estimate of the true value; however, the values do not meet NIST criteria for 
certification and are provided with associated uncertainties that may not include all sources of uncertainty [2].   
 
Information  Values:    Information  values  for  thyroglobulin,  thyroid  stimulating  hormone (TSH),  total  reverse 
triiodothyronine, and serum density are provided in Table 3.  An information value is considered to be a value that 
will be of use to the SRM user, but insufficient information is available to assess the uncertainty associated with the 
value or only a limited number of analyses were performed [2].   
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 1949 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until  01 April 2027,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  given  in  this 
certificate (see “Instructions for Handling, Storage, and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, 
contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Coordination of the technical measurements leading to the certification of this SRM was performed by S.E. Long and 
A.S.P. Boggs-Russell  of  the  NIST  Chemical  Sciences  Division  and  B.L. Catron-Kassim,  formerly  of  NIST.  
Coordination of the collaborative production and measurements of the SRM at the CDC was performed by D.S. Tevis 
of the Inorganic and Radiation Analytical Toxicology Branch, Division of Laboratory Sciences, National Center for 
Environmental Health. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
Storage:  The serum is shipped frozen (on dry ice) and, upon receipt, should be stored frozen until ready for use.  A 
freezer temperature of –20 °C is acceptable for storage for up to one week.  If a longer storage time is anticipated, the 
material should be stored at or below –50 °C.  The SRM should not be exposed to sunlight or ultraviolet radiation.  
Storage of thawed material at room or refrigerator temperatures may result in changes in the hormone concentrations.  
The material is kept at –80 °C for long-term storage at NIST.  Under these conditions, the hormones are expected to 
be stable.   
 
Handling and Use:  SRM 1949 is provided as frozen serum that should be allowed to thaw at room temperature for 
at  least  30 min  under  subdued  light.    After  the  material  is  equilibrated  to  room  temperature,  it  should  be  used 
immediately.  The contents of the vial should then be gently mixed prior to removal of a test portion for analysis.  
Precautions should be taken to avoid exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet radiation during handling and use. 
 
SOURCE, PREPARATION, AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Source and Preparation:  SRM 1949 was developed after an appropriate human subjects research determination 
by NIST.  This SRM was prepared from maternal serum pools collected by Equitech-Bio Inc. (Kerrville, TX).  The 
serum  comprised  four  types:  serum  from  donors  in  each  of  the  three  trimesters,  and  non-pregnant  donors  of 
reproductive  age.    Trimester  collections  were  defined  as  follows:  first  trimester,  6  to  10  weeks  pregnant,  second 
trimester, 18 to 21 weeks pregnant, and third trimester, 32 to 35 weeks pregnant.  The serum was shipped frozen on 
dry-ice to the CDC for processing where the pools were prepared in a Class 100 clean room.  Materials expected to 
contact the serum, including containers, dispensers, and cryovials were pre-screened to ensure suitability for use in 
trace metals analysis.  Serum (16 units, ~500 mL each, 4 units/pool) was thawed and homogenized on nutating mixers 
at 4 °C.  The cold serum units were filtered through sterile gauze pads to remove suspended material and combined 
into the appropriate pools.  The pools were then allowed to equilibrate to room temperature.  Serum was then dispensed 
into cryovials using an automated dispenser system, with continuous homogenization of the serum using magnetic 
stirring plates.  The cryovials were immediately capped and stored at approximately –70 °C.

Analytical Approach for Determination of Thyroxine, Triiodothyronine and Reverse Triiodothyronine (NIST):  
Total thyroxine (T4), total triiodothyronine (T3), and total reverse triiodothyronine (rT3) were determined by liquid 
chromatography  tandem  mass  spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)  using  an  analytical  approach  based  on  the  NIST 
LC-MS/MS reference methods [5,6].  Samples of SRM 1949 were removed from storage at –80 °C and equilibrated 
to room temperature for 2 h while protected from light.  Sample aliquots of 0.5 g were gravimetrically spiked with a 
mixture of labeled internal standards (T4-13C6, T3-13C6, and rT3-13C6), diluted with 0.4 mL of deionized water, and 
allowed  to  equilibrate  at room  temperature  for 1 h  while protected  from  light.   After  equilibration, 70 μL  of  25 % 
ammonium hydroxide (volume fraction) was added to the sample.  The alkaline sample was then extracted using solid 
phase extraction (SPE) Oasis MAX cartridges (Waters, Milford, MA), which had been pre-conditioned with 7 mL of 
methanol followed by 7 mL deionized water.  The sample was loaded, the effluent collected, and reloaded to maximize 
analyte  binding.    The  cartridge  was  then  washed  with  3 mL  of  2 %  ammonium  hydroxide  (volume  fraction)  in 
deionized water and 3 mL of methanol.  The measurands were then eluted from the cartridge using 7 mL of methanol 
containing  0.05 %  hydrochloric  acid  (volume  fraction).    The  extract  was  evaporated  to  dryness  under  nitrogen  at 
40 °C,  reconstituted  in  100 μL  of  methanol,  water,  and  formic  acid  mixture  (50:50:0.025,  volume  fraction)  and 
transferred to a glass insert in an amber autosampler vial for injection onto the LC-MS/MS.  An AB Sciex API 4000 
LC-MS/MS system coupled to an Agilent 1100 Series LC was utilized for the analyses.  Separation was conducted 
using an  Agilent Eclipse  C18  Plus  column  (2.1 mm x  150 mm, 5 μm  particle  size).   An  isocratic mobile  phase  of 
methanol and deionized water (60:40 volume fraction) with 0.5 % formic acid was used at a flow rate of 200 μL/min 
for 10 min.  Electrospray ionization in positive mode was used for multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) of quantitative 
and qualitative transitions for each analyte.  Samples were quantified using independent calibration curves for each 
analyte to remove the possibility of cross contamination.  Calibrants were assayed for chemical mass purity using a 
quantitative 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-qNMR) procedure.  
 
Analytical Approach for Determination of Vitamin D Binding Protein by LC-MS (NIST):  Serum samples were 
processed  using  a  tryptic  digestion. 
  A  protein-denaturing  mixture  was  prepared  by  adding  100 μL 
trifluoroethanol (TFE),  44 μL  of  50 mmol/L  tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine  hydrochloride (TCEP)  (dissolved  in 
50 mmol/L Tris and adjusted to pH 8.0 using 5 mol/L NaOH), and 80 μL of 50 mmol/L Tris buffer.  Samples were 
prepared  with  11 μL  of  SRM 1949  serum  in  low  binding  tubes  (Eppendorf,  Hauppauge, NY)  and  11 μL  of  the 
denaturing  solution.    Iodoacetamide  (2 μL  of  300 mmol/L)  was  added  to  each  sample  (25 mmol/L  final 
concentration).  Samples were then vortexed and incubated in the dark for 45 min.  Samples were diluted with the 
addition of Tris buffer such that the concentration of TFE was <5 % by volume.  Trypsin was prepared in 10 mmol/L 
acetic acid  (17.5 units/μL) and 20 μL  (350 units) and then added to  each  sample  vial.  Samples  were  digested at 
37 °C for 19 h.  The digestions were stopped by adding trifluoroacetic acid at a concentration of 0.5 % by volume.  
A 30 μL aliquot was removed from each digested sample, and an appropriate amount of the labeled peptide mixture 
was  added.    Peptides  TSALSAK  and  VLEPTLK  were  used  for  total  VDBP  quantification,  by  multiple  reaction 
monitoring (MRM).    The  two  transitions  with  the  greatest  intensity  for  each  peptide  were  selected.    LC  MRM 
analyses of SRM 1949 digests were performed using a Discover BIO Wide C18 column (2.1 mm x 150 mm, 3 μm, 
Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and guard column of the same packing material (2.1 mm x 2 cm, 3 μm).  The column 
was heated to 40 °C and coupled to an Agilent 6490 triple quadrupole.  Calibrants (5 μL), and digested samples 
(3 μL,  approximately  1 pmol  of  each)  were  injected  in  triplicate.    Peptides  were  eluted  at  250 μL/min  with  the 
following gradient: 2 % to 30 % B over 40 min., 30 % to 90 % B over 5 min., 90 % B to 2 % B over 1 min., and 
2 % B for the last 20 min.  Solvent A was 0.1 % formic acid in water (by volume) and solvent B was 0.1 % formic 
acid in acetonitrile (by volume).  
 
Analytical Approach for Determination of 25(OH)D3, 25(OH)D2, and 3-epi-25(OH)D3 by LC-MS/MS (NIST):  
Serum  (0.75 g)  was  spiked  with  an  appropriate  internal  standard  solution  [25(OH)D3-13C5,  25(OH)D2-13C3,  or 
3-epi-25(OH)D3-d3].    After  equilibration  at  room  temperature  for  1 h,  the  pH  of  each  sample  was  adjusted  to 
pH 9.8 ± 0.2 with carbonate buffer.  Analytes were extracted twice from the serum matrix with a mixture of hexane 
and ethyl acetate.  The combined extracts were dried under nitrogen at 45 °C, and the residues were reconstituted with 
methanol for LC-MS/MS analysis.  Extracts were analyzed on a SCIEX QTRAP 6500+ LC-MS/MS system using an 
Ascentis Express F5 column under isocratic conditions with water:methanol mobile phases.  APCI in the positive-ion 
mode and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode were used.  The following transitions were monitored: m/z 401 
→ m/z 386 for 25(OH)D3 and 3-epi-25(OH)D3; m/z 404 → m/z 386 for 3-epi-25(OH)D3-d3; m/z 406 → m/z 388 for 
25(OH)D3-13C5; m/z 413 → m/z 395 for 25(OH)D2; and m/z 416 → m/z 398 for 25(OH)D2-13C3. 
 
Analytical Approach for Determination of Trace Metals (CDC):  Reference mass concentration values for copper, 
selenium and zinc are the means of results from the CDC using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-
MS).    Fifteen  replicates  were  analyzed  for  each  level  of  SRM 1949.    Each  serum  replicate  was  diluted  1:30  with 
diluent (10 μg/L Ga, as an internal standard, in 2 % volume fraction nitric acid, 5 % volume fraction ethyl alcohol and 
0.01 % volume fraction Triton™ X-100 in high-purity de-ionized water), and then analyzed by introducing an aerosol 
of this dilution to an ELAN Dynamic Reaction Cell (DRC) II ICP-MS instrument (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) using 
an  SC4-DX  (Elemental  Scientific  Inc.,  Omaha, NE)  autosampler.    External,  matrix-matched,  weighted  linear

calibration  using  SI-traceable  standards  (High-Purity  Standards,  Charleston, SC)  was  used  to  quantify  the  total 
elemental  concentrations.    All  elements  were  measured  in  dynamic  reaction  cell  mode  (using  ammonia  gas)  to 
eliminate polyatomic interferences.  
 
Analytical  Approach  for  Determination  of  Thyroglobulin  and  Thyroid  Stimulating  Hormone  (NIST):  
Information  values  for  thyroglobulin  and  TSH  were  determined  at  NIST  using  commercial  enzyme  linked 
immunoassay (ELISA)  kits (thyroglobulin:  Abcam, Cambridge, UK;  TSH:  Abcam,  Cambridge, UK  and  Biomatik, 
Cambridge, Ontario, Canada).  Samples of SRM 1949 were brought to room temperature, gently mixed, buffered, and 
analyzed according to kit specifications.  Following application of sample aliquots to the plate wells, an orbital shaker 
was  used  to incubate the  samples at room  temperature,  and  the  plate  was then read  at  450 nm  absorbance  using a 
BioTek® Synergy HT microplate reader (Winooski, VT). 
 
Homogeneity  Assessment:    The  homogeneity  of  the  trace  metals  was  assessed  at  the  CDC  using  the  methods 
described  above.    Based  on  the  repeatability  data  for  fifteen  replicate  measurements,  the  material  does  not  show 
significant  heterogeneity  with  respect  to  trace  elements  across  all  the  pool  levels.    Additional  assessment  of  the 
homogeneity  of  the  iodine  hormones  was  made  during  the  value  assignment  measurements  at  NIST.    Again,  no 
significant heterogeneity was indicated. 
 
Certified  Value  Assignment:    Each  certified  value  listed  in  Table 1  is  the  mean  of  measurements  from  a  single 
method.  The uncertainty of each value incorporates the standard error of that mean with additional components of 
uncertainty (Type B components related to the analysis), consistent with the ISO/JCGM Guide [3].  The uncertainty 
provided with each value is an expanded uncertainty about the mean to cover the measurand with approximately 95 % 
confidence.  The expanded uncertainty is calculated as U = kuc, where uc is the combined standard uncertainty, and k 
is a coverage factor corresponding to approximately 95 % confidence [3].  For expression of units appropriate to the 
measurement  community,  the  values have  been  converted, where necessary,  from  a  mass  fraction  basis  to  a  mass 
concentration basis using the measured serum density.  The value can be converted back to a mass fraction basis if 
needed, by dividing by the listed density value (Table 3).  The measurands are the total concentrations of the analytes 
listed in Table 1.  Metrological traceability is to the SI derived units of mass concentration, expressed as micrograms 
per deciliter or nanograms per deciliter.
