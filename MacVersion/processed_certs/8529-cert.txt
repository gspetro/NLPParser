Report of Investigation 
 
Reference Material 8529 
IAEA-S-3 
(Sulfur Isotopes in Silver Sulfide) 

 
This  Reference  Material (RM)  is  intended  for  use  in  developing  and  validating  methods  for  measuring  relative 
differences in sulfur (S) isotope-number ratios, R(34S/32S) [1].  It can also be used for anchoring normalizations on 
the  34S-depleted  end  of  the  Vienna  Cañon  Diablo Troilite (VCDT)  δ-scale  for  δ34S  values [2].    Even  though  the 
value  for  this  RM  is  a  reference  value  and  not  certified [3],  its  use  will  improve  the  comparability  of  data  from 
different  laboratories.    The  equivalent  name  for  this  RM,  as  used  by  the  International  Atomic  Energy 
Agency (IAEA)  and  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey (USGS),  is  IAEA-S-3.    This  material  was  formerly  called 
NZ-3 (New  Zealand) [4].    A  unit  of  RM 8529  consists  of  one  bottle  containing  approximately  0.5 g  of  silver 
sulfide (Ag2S).

(a)  A  reference  value  is  a  non-certified  value  that  is  the  best  estimate  of  the  true  value;  however,  the  value  may  reflect 

only the measurement precision and may not include all sources of uncertainty [3]. 

(b)  The  δ34SVCDT  value  is  expressed  as  a  mean  and  an  expanded  uncertainty.    The  expanded  uncertainty  is  equal  to  U = kuc, 
where uc is the combined standard uncertainty as defined by the ISO Guide [5] and k is the coverage factor.  The combined 
standard  uncertainty  is  intended  to  represent,  at  the  level  of  one  standard  deviation,  the  effects  of  random  errors  on  the 
reference  value  that  were  evaluated  by  statistical  means  (Type A).    The  coverage  factor,  k = 2.201 (n = 12),  provides  an 
expanded  uncertainty  interval  that  has  about  a  95 %  probability  of  encompassing  the  mean.    The  δ34SVCDT  value  and 
combined standard uncertainty are the revised values reported in references 6 and 7 after adjusting the coverage factor 
from k = 2 to k = 2.201. 

 
Expiration of Value Assignment:  RM 8529 is valid, within the specified measurement uncertainty specified, until 
31 December 2020,  provided  the  RM  is  handled  in  accordance  with  instructions  given  in  this  Report  of 
Investigation  (see  “Instructions  for  Handling,  Storage,  and  Use”).    This  report  is  nullified  if  the  RM  is  damaged, 
contaminated, or otherwise modified 
 
Maintenance  of  RM  Certification:    NIST  will  monitor  this  RM  over  the  period  of  its  validity.    If  substantive 
technical changes occur that affect the value assignment  before the expiration of this  report, NIST will notify the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
The technical aspects involved in the issuance of this RM were coordinated through the NIST Chemical Sciences 
Division by R.D. Vocke, Jr. 
 
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  RM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Office  of  Reference 
Materials.

Reference Difference in Isotope-Number Ratio Values:  The differences in measured isotope-number ratios of 
stable sulfur isotopes in substance P, R(34S/32S)P = [N(34S)P / N(32S)P], are reported as δ34S values [2].  The relative 
differences in isotope-number ratios for sulfur are referenced to VCDT where: 
 

δ34S = [R(34S/32S)sample / R(34S/32S)VCDT] – 1 

 
VCDT  refers  to  the  Vienna  Cañon-Diablo  Troilite  scale,  which  is  defined  by  assigning  a  consensus  δ34S  value 
of -0.3 ‰ to RM 8554 [2], where the symbol ‰ is part per thousand and is equal to 0.001. 

INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
Handling  and  Storage:    RM 8529  is  stable  at  normal  room  temperatures.    To  minimize  the  potential  for 
contamination, it is recommended that this RM be stored in the container in which it is supplied. 
 
Distribution:  The distribution of RM 8529 (IAEA-S-3) is limited to one unit per three-year period of time. 
 

PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS OF THE REFERENCE MATERIAL 

Preparation:  RM 8529 was prepared and purified by B.W. Robinson, Lower Hutt, New Zealand from a sphalerite 
provided by S. Halas, Maria Curie-Skłodowskie University, Lublin Poland [4]. 
 
Analytical Methods:  The δ34S value and expanded uncertainty reported in Table 1 are the values resulting from 
combining  data  from  gas  isotope  ratio  mass  spectrometry  (after  converting  IAEA-S-2  to  SF6)  and  double-spike 
thermal ionization mass spectrometry (with Carius-Tube dissolution after spiking) [6,7]. 
 
The δ34S value and expanded uncertainty reported in Table 1 for RM 8529 (IAEA-S-3) are the values accepted by 
the  Commission  on  Isotopic  Abundances  and  Atomic  Weights  of  the  International  Union  of  Pure  and  Applied 
Chemistry (IUPAC) (http://ciaaw.org/Sulfur.htm) and the IAEA as of the date of this report. 
 
Isotopic Homogeneity:  Data from an inter-laboratory comparison of IAEA-S-3 suggest that there is no evidence of 
isotopic heterogeneity in this reference material [4]. 
 
Normalization:    The  δ34S  values  in  samples  should  be  normalized  to  the  VCDT  δ-scale  by  calibrating  the 
measurement with respect to the δ-value for IAEA-S-1 (RM 8554) and the δ-value from the appropriate 34S-enriched 
or  34S-depleted  anchor  RMs.    IAEA-S-2 (RM 8555)  should  be  used  as  the  anchor  for  the  34S-enriched  end  while 
IAEA-S-3  (RM 8529)  is  appropriate  for  the  34S-depleted  end  of  the  scale.    A  general  formula  for  normalizing 
measured sulfur isotope number ratios using two laboratory standards LS1 (e.g. IAEA-S-1, RM 8554) and LS2 (e.g. 
IAEA-S-3, RM 8529) can be expressed as:

Note:  In the formulas above, cal denotes calibrated measurements made versus the VCDT scale, and δ34S LS1,cal and δ34S LS2,cal are 
the  conventionally  fixed  δ34S  values  for  IAEA-S-1 (RM 8554)  and  IAEA-S-3 (RM 8529).    WS  denotes  measurements  made 
versus  a  transfer  gas  (working  standard),  and  δ34S  LS1,WS  and  δ34S  LS2,WS  are  the  δ34S  values  for  calibrated  laboratory  working 
standards. 
 
Reporting  of  Sulfur  Stable  Isotope  δ-values:    The  following  recommendations  from  IUPAC  are  provided  for 
reporting δ34S values [2].  It is recommended that: 

 
 
 

the use of meteoritic troilite and the reporting of δ34S data relative to CDT be discontinued; 
all relative sulfur isotopic compositions be reported relative to VCDT; 
the VCDT scale be realized through the use of IAEA-S-1, silver sulfide (RM 8554). 

In  addition,  researchers  are  encouraged  to  report  the  isotopic  composition  of  RM 8529 (IAEA-S-3)  and  other 
internationally distributed sulfur isotopic reference materials [8] in their publications, as appropriate to the method, 
as though they have been interspersed among unknowns. 

Current Reports of Investigation (ROI) for all light stable isotopic Reference Materials mentioned in this report are 
available on the NIST Standard Reference Materials web site [9].
