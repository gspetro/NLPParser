This certificate reports the certified values for Lot 52-D-XX. 

for  Lot 

 
This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  a  primary  gas  mixture  for  which  the  amount-of-substance  fraction, 
expressed  as  concentration [1],  may  be  related  to  secondary  working  standards.    This  SRM  is  intended  for  the 
calibration of instruments used for carbon monoxide determinations and for other applications. 
 
This SRM mixture is supplied in a DOT 3AL-specification aluminum (6061 alloy) cylinder with a water volume of 
6 L.  Mixtures are shipped with a nominal pressure exceeding 12.4 MPa (1800 psig), which provides the user with 
0.73 m3 (25.8 ft3) of useable mixture.  The cylinder is the property of the purchaser and is equipped with a CGA-350 
brass valve, which is the recommended outlet for this carbon monoxide mixture.   
 
Certified Value:  This SRM mixture has been certified for carbon monoxide concentration.  The certified value given 
below applies to the identified cylinder and NIST sample number.

A NIST certified  value is a  value  for  which NIST has the  highest confidence in its accuracy  in that all known or 
suspected sources of bias  have been investigated or taken into account [2].  The uncertainty of the certified value 
includes the estimated uncertainties in the NIST standards, the analytical comparisons to the lot standard (LS), and 
the uncertainty of comparing the LS with each of the mixtures comprising this lot.  The uncertainty is expressed as an 
expanded uncertainty U = kuc with uc determined by experiment and a coverage factor k = 2.  The true value for the 
carbon monoxide amount-of-substance fraction is asserted to lie in the interval defined by the certified value ± U with 
a level of confidence of approximately 95 % [3]. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 2641a Lot No. 52-D-XX is valid from the certificate issue 
»d  in 
date, within the measurement uncertainties specified, until 18 May 2026, provided the SRM is handled and stored in 
accordance  with  the  instructions  given  in  this  certificate  (see  “Cylinder  and  Gas  Handling  Information”).    The 
certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Cylinder and Gas Handling Information:  NIST recommends the use of a high-purity, two-stage pressure regulator 
with a stainless steel diaphragm and CGA-350 outlet to safely reduce the pressure and to deliver this SRM mixture to 
the  instrument.    The  regulator  should  be  purged  to  prevent  accidental  contamination  of  the  SRM  by  repeatedly 
(minimum  three  times)  opening  the  valve  and  pressurizing  the  regulator,  then  closing  the  valve  and  releasing  the 
pressure  safely  into  a  vent  line.    This  SRM  should  not  be  used  after  the  internal  pressure  drops  below  0.7 MPa 
(100 psig).  This SRM should be stored under normal laboratory conditions within the temperature range of 15 ºC to 
30 ºC. 
 
The overall direction and coordination of the technical work required for certification of this SRM were performed by 
F.R. Guenther, formerly of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division.

Analytical measurements leading to the certification of the current SRM lot were performed by L. Gameson of the 
NIST Chemical Sciences Division.   
 
Office  of  Reference 
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Office  of  Reference 
Materials. 
 
Traceability:  The measurand is the total concentration of carbon monoxide in nitrogen and the certified value is 
metrologically traceable to the SI unit of moles of carbon monoxide per total moles of carbon monoxide and nitrogen. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Mixture Preparation:  The gas mixtures comprising this SRM lot were prepared in accordance with NIST technical 
specifications by a commercial specialty gas vendor under contract to NIST.  The specifications stipulate that each 
SRM mixture be identical in carbon monoxide concentration and stable with time. 
 
Analytical Methods:  Analyses of the carbon monoxide concentration for this lot of cylinders were conducted by 
comparing each cylinder mixture to a representative cylinder chosen from the lot, the LS, using gas chromatography 
with a thermal conductivity detector (GC/TCD).  Assignment of the carbon monoxide concentration to the LS was 
accomplished by comparison to primary gravimetric standards using GC/TCD. 
 
Homogeneity Analysis:  Each of the carbon monoxide mixtures that comprise this SRM lot was compared to the LS 
using  GC/TCD.    A  statistical  analysis  of  the  analytical  results  indicated  that  sample-to-sample  carbon  monoxide 
concentration  differences  were  not  statistically  significant.    This  indicates  that,  within  the  precision  of  the  NIST 
measurements,  all  of  the  cylinders  comprising  this  SRM  lot  have  identical  carbon  monoxide  concentrations.  
Therefore, one concentration has been assigned to the entire SRM lot.  
 
Assignment: 
Carbon Monoxide Concentration Value Assignment:  The certified carbon monoxide concentration for this SRM 
lot was computed from the assigned concentration for the lot standard and the homogeneity analysis. 
 
CAS  Registry  Numbers:    This  SRM  is  certified  for  carbon  monoxide  in  nitrogen.    The  relevant  CAS  Registry 
numbers for these components are: carbon monoxide CAS Registry 630-08-0; nitrogen CAS Registry 7727-37-9.
