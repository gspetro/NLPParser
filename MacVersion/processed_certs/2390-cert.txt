Certificate of Analysis
Standard Reference Material® 2390

DNA Profiling Standard

Standard  Reference  Material  (SRM)  2390  is  intended  for  (1)  standardization  of  forensic  and  paternity  quality
assurance  procedures  for  Restriction  Fragment  Length  Polymorphisms  (RFLP)  testing  using  HaeIII  restriction
enzymes,  and  (2)  instructional  law  enforcement  or  nonclinical  research  purposes.    It  is  NOT  intended  for  any
human/animal clinical diagnostic use.

SRM 2390 was originally certified in 1992 using measurements performed during 1990 through 1991 [1].  While RFLP
allelic band size is nominally equal to the number of nucleotide base pairs (bp) in a DNA fragment, measured band
size  is  a  protocol-defined  quantity [2].    The  RFLP  measurement  protocols  recommended  by  the  Royal  Canadian
Mounted Police [3], the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation [4], and the Scientific Working Group for DNA Analysis
Methods [5] are sufficiently similar to provide validly comparable values [6].  This certificate updates the band size
values of the original SRM 2390 certification to reflect the evolution of forensic practice from 1991 to 1998.

Each SRM 2390 unit consists of 20 components.  Quantitative allelic band sizes are provided for human DNA from
two sources:  (1) the female cell line K562, and (2) the male source “TAW.”  Three different forms of material from the
two  sources  are  provided:    (1) cell pellet, (2)  extracted  genomic  DNA,  and  (3) a  HaeIII  restriction  digest  “pre-cut”
DNA.  The remaining components are well-characterized consumable materials required for qualitative evaluation of
the HaeIII RFLP measurement process.  These components include standards for quantifying extracted DNA by use
of yield gels, a DNA ladder for band size determination, materials for labeling the DNA size ladder, a viral DNA marker
for  assessment  of  electrophoretic  separation,  and  agarose  that  is  compatible  with  all  DNA  components.    See
Components and Storage on page 2 of this certificate for a detailed listing of the components.

Expiration  of  Certification:    When  stored  as  specified  in  the  Components  and  Storage  section  on  page  2,  the
certified values should remain within their uncertainty limits for at least five years from the date of shipment.  NIST
will keep samples of this material under surveillance for five years after the date of last sale.  If changes occur beyond
the limits certified, NIST will notify purchasers.

The  technical  aspects  of  the  recertification  process  were  coordinated  by  D.J.  Reeder  formerly  of  the  NIST
Biotechnology Division. Material stability studies and coordination of the interlaboratory study were performed by
K.L. Richie of the NIST Biotechnology Division. Data analyses was provided by D.L. Duewer of the NIST Analytical
Chemistry Division.

Statistical consultation on aspects of these analyses was provided by H-k. Liu of the NIST Statistical Engineering
Division.

The  support  aspects  involved  in  the  recertification  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Standard
Reference Materials Program by J.C. Colbert.

All  measurements  used  in  the  recertification  of  allelic  band  sizes  of  SRM  2390  K562  and  TAW  components  were
performed by personnel of the laboratories listed in Appendix A.

Certified Band Sizes:  Tables 1 and 2 list certified values (expected allelic band sizes and sizing uncertainty) for band
size measurements of the cell pellet and extracted genomic SRM 2390 K562 and TAW DNA at six commonly probed
genetic  loci:  D1S7  [7],  D2S44  [8,9],  D4S139  [10],  D5S110  [11],  D10S28  [12],  and  D17S79  [13].    Due  to  strong
measurement-related correlation among allelic bands for a given sample, sizing uncertainty is defined for the pair of
allelic bands at these six genetic loci.  Two sets of certified values are provided:  (1) a set reflecting measurement
practice at the beginning of 1998, based only on results of a NIST-conducted interlaboratory comparison [14], and (2)
a  set  reflecting  measurement  practice  from  1991  through  1997  [15].    These  certified  allelic  band  size  regions  are
presented in graphical form in Figures 1a through 1f.

Informational Band Sizes:  Table 3 lists informational values for SRM 2390 K562 and TAW DNA band sizes at six
less commonly probed genetic loci:  D7S467 [16], D7Z2 [17], D8S358 [18], D14S13 [9], D17S26 [19], and DYZ1 [20].

NOTICE AND WARNING TO USER

The K562 cell line was derived from a human subject with a diagnosis of chronic myelogenous leukemia [19,20].  The
TAW male DNA components are derived from blood cells from a healthy human; these materials have been tested
and found to be nonreactive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAG)  and  HIV  by  FDA-approved  testing.    No  test
method can ensure that human-derived material does not contain infectious agents.  HANDLE AS IF CAPABLE OF
TRANSMITTING DISEASE.

SOURCE AND ANALYSIS

Stability:  All components except the three noted below were found unchanged from the original certification upon
retesting in 1998.  Due to long term storage and possible desiccation at –20 °C, component #1 may contain less than
its stated 30 µL volume.  The total amount of molecular weight marker DNA has neither changed nor degraded.  If
you have received an SRM with component #1 having reduced volume, reconstitute to 30 µL with distilled/deionized
water.

While the band sizes for the precut SRM 2390 K562 and TAW DNA components are qualitatively the same as their
non-precut analogues, they yield band sizes that are quantitatively distinguishable.  The magnitude of the difference
appears to have increased from 1991 to 1997 [14].  Therefore, components #14 and #17 should be used for qualitative
evaluations only.

Source  of  Material:  The  TAW  male  materials  and  the  10X  buffer  were  provided  by  Analytical  Genetic  Testing
Center, Inc., Denver, CO.  The K562 female materials and all other components of the SRM were provided by Life
Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD.

Certified  Values  for  Forensic  Practice  as  of  1997:    The  certified  allelic  band  sizes  in  Table  1  are  derived  from
analyses performed at 20 forensic laboratories from Fall 1997 through Spring 1998.  The participants in this study are
listed in Appendix A.  These participants were requested (1) to use as many components of the SRM 2390 unit as
were compatible with their routine RFLP analysis systems, (2)  to  analyze  the  SRM  2390  K562  and  TAW  materials
using as close to their routine casework protocols as possible, and (3) to report allelic band sizes for all genetic loci
they  routinely  probe.    Many  participants  supplied  copies  of  the  autoradiograms  and/or  chemilumigrams  resulting
from their analyses.  Images of a “representative” set of chemilumigrams are provided in Appendix B.

Because  these  data  are  representative  of  a  maximum  of  20  laboratories,  the  sizing  uncertainty  is  expressed  as  a
95 %/95 % tolerance region.  NIST certifies, with 95 % confidence, that 95 % of all measurement pairs at a given locus
that are validly characteristic of forensic practice on or about the end of 1997 will be bounded by the given ellipse.  In
addition to numeric specification in Table 1, these tolerance ellipses are defined by the thin black line in Figures 1a
through 1f.  A detailed description of the analysis and interpretation of results from this interlaboratory comparison
exercise has been published [14].

Certified  Values  for  Forensic  Practice  from  1991  through  1997:    The  certified  allelic  band  sizes  in  Table  2  are
based upon all relevant RFLP band sizing data available, including non-SRM 2390 K562 information from proficiency
tests conducted from 1991 through 1997 and well documented empirical relationships [6,23-25].

Since  these  certified  values  are  based  upon  a  large  body  of  data,  the  sizing  uncertainty  is  expressed  as  a  99 %
tolerance interval.  NIST certifies that 99 % of all measurement pairs, at a given locus that are validly characteristic of
forensic practice from 1991 through 1997, will be bounded by the given ellipse.  In addition to numeric specification in
Table 2, these tolerance ellipses are defined by the thick black line in Figures 1a through 1f.  A detailed description of
the analysis and interpretation of results from this interlaboratory comparison exercise has been published [15].

measurements  at  a  given  locus  as  x1  and  the  smaller  as  x2.    With  95 %  confidence,  95 %  of  “1997-valid”  {x1,x2}
measurement pairs for the cell pellet and extracted genomic components of SRM 2390 will be within the  95 %/95 %

Details  on  the  construction  of  these  tolerance  ellipses  and  estimation  of  the  critical  values  are  provided  in
Reference [14].  Figures 1a through 1f  state  these  certified  band  sizes  (the  location  of  the  “×”  in  the  figures)  and
95 %/95 % tolerance region (the region inside the black ellipse) for these six loci in graphical form.

The  DNA  Advisory  Board  STANDARD  9.5  states,  “The  laboratory  shall  check  its  DNA  procedures  annually  or
whenever  substantial  changes  are  made  to  the  protocol(s)  against  an  appropriate  and  available  NIST  Standard
Reference Material or standard traceable to a NIST standard.”  We suggest that each user of this SRM plot their own
band size measurements for each locus using an appropriate computer graphics system or a copy of the enclosed
figures.  Preparation of such plots is an appropriate “check [of] DNA procedures.”  See Reference [14]  for  further
details.

Annex
Standard Reference Material® 2390

DNA Profiling Standard

Standard Reference Material (SRM) 2390 contains 20 components designed to help laboratories who are performing
DNA profiling by Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) methods.

Each component is included to allow laboratories to verify that their own analysis system is operating within proper
controls.

The following is a brief summary of the function of each component:

Components #1 to #5:

consist of a DNA Analysis Marker System.  This system is used for proper sizing of DNA

bands revealed through Southern blotting applications with 32P-labeled probes.

Component #20:

is a highly purified agarose with low electroendosmosis.  It has been functionally tested with the

rest of the components in the set.

Components #6 to #11:

consist of a set of human genomic DNA samples to be used as standards for a yield gel.

The reagent concentrations range from 250 ng to 6 ng.

Component #19:

Component #18:

is  a  10X  loading  buffer  to  be  diluted  1:1  and  used  as  a  5X  concentration  for  use  in
testing unknown DNA samples.

is  an  adenovirus  visible  ladder  to  be  used  as  a  marker  lane  to  assure  that  the
electrophoretic procedures are performing correctly.

Components #12 to #14:

consist of K562 DNA (female) in three forms:  #12 approximately 3 million cells; #13 pre-
extracted genomic DNA; #14 genomic DNA predigested with Hae III restriction enzyme
(pre-mixed with loading buffer).

Components #15 to #17:

consist  of  DNA  (male)  in  three  forms:    #15  approximately  3  million  cells;  #16
pre-extracted  genomic  DNA;  #17  genomic  DNA  predigested  with  Hae  III  restriction
enzyme.

Details and instructions for use of each component are given on the following pages.

OVERVIEW

a)

b)

SRM  2390  can  be  used  in  several  different  ways  depending  on  the  laboratory’s  needs  in  quality  assurance.
Components of the SRM are intended for use to assure that each step of a protocol for DNA profiling is functioning
properly.

DNA  samples  are  optimally  analyzed  using  the  protocol  similar  to  the  one  used  by  the  Federal  Bureau  of
Investigation (FBI).  This protocol and the relevant SRM component used in checking this step consists of:

extracting DNA from the cell pellet - Components #12 and #15

quantifying  the  amount  of  DNA  extracted  using  the  set  of  quantitative  controls  supplied  with  the  SRM  -
Components #6 to #11

cutting the DNA with a Hae III restriction enzyme - Components #13 and #16

testing the restriction process by gel electrophoresis - Components #14 and #17

running all samples by electrophoresis on an analytical gel with Tris Acetate EDTA buffer and appropriate viral
DNA markers for assessing proper separation - Components #1 to #5; #18; #20

blotting the separated DNA onto a nylon membrane using an alkaline transfer solution

hybridizing the sample DNA to radioactively-labeled or chemiluminescent DNA probes

exposing the membrane to x-ray film

imaging  the  developed  autoradiogram  with  a  computerized  imaging  system  to  determine  band  sizes  -
Components #1 to #5 and certified band sizes

Laboratories that use a “working DNA standard” on a daily basis, such as K562 or another source of DNA, qualify
their working standards in a lane on an analytical gel and perform band sizing for their materials using the SRM set.
Such calibrated working standards can then be deemed “traceable to NIST standards.”

In  a  quality  assurance  role,  the  SRM  may  be  used  to  verify  that  various  components,  such  as  Hae  III  enzyme,
agarose,  extraction  procedures,  and  yield  gel  results,  etc.,  are  functioning  properly  by  direct  comparison  to  the
appropriate  component.    For  example,  a  laboratory’s  properly  functioning  extraction  protocol  and  restriction
digestion  procedure  using  Hae  III  should  give  equivalent  results  as  those  presented  by  the  pre-digested  DNA
samples.

in a solution containing 0.015 M NaCl, 0.0015 M sodium citrate, and 0.1 % SDS.  All fragment bands were distinct and
sharp on a 3-day autoradiograph using X-OMAT® film with a Cronex® Lightning Plus intensifying screen1 at -80 °C.

*Patent # 5,316,908 (Life Technologies, Inc.)

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF COMPONENTS #1 THROUGH #5

Electrophoresis of Marker DNA:  The concentration of Marker DNA is adjusted so that 3 µL of Component #1 will
generate a good signal in a 3-day exposure by the assay given above.

Add 3 µL of Component #1 to sufficient Component #2 to give 10 µL total volume (7 µL).
Heat the marker at 65 °C for 5 min.

1.
2.
Load heated marker on an agarose gel in a lane adjacent to the other samples.  If a stronger signal is desired, i.e., for
shorter film exposure times, the amount of Marker DNA may be increased.

                                                                

1Certain commercial equipment, instruments, or materials are identified in this certificate (or report, if applicable) in order
to  adequately  specify  the  experimental  procedure.    Such  identification  does  not  imply  recommendation  or  endorsement  by  the
National Institute of Standards and Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the
best available for the purpose.

2.

In a clean microcentrifuge tube place:
- 44 µL Component #3 (Labeling Component)
- 5 µL a32P-dCTP (10 mCi/mL, 3000 Ci/mmol)
- 1 µL DNA Polymerase Large Fragment (Component #4, 3 units)
Incubate for 1 h at 23 °C to 25 °C. =:50 % of the radioactivity should be incorporated and may be monitored by
spermine for TCA precipitation.
Terminate the reaction by the addition of 50 µL Stop Buffer (Component #5).
Denature the probe by boiling 10 min.
Transfer the tube containing the probe from the boiling water to an ice bath.  Leave the probe on ice for 5 min.

3.
4.
5.
6. Microcentrifuge the probe for 2 min.  This step not only brings down liquid from the sides of the tube, but also
pellets denatured protein, etc., that causes background during the hybridization.  In NIST’s experience, this is
the  only  purification  of  the  probe  that  is  necessary.    Although  further  purification  is  not  recommended,  the
unincorporated nucleotides may be removed by gel filtration.
The  Marker  Ladder  can  be  hybridized  at  the  same  time  as  other  samples  for  analysis.    Add  1  µL  of  labeled
marker probe per mL of hybridization solution, along with other probe(s).

Description:  This product is a cocktail of digested and undigested Adenovirus DNA.  Fragments range in size from
594 bp to 35 937 bp.  At the recommended loading, the 594 bp band should just be visible.

Use of Markers:  Optimum signal is obtained by adding 185 ng of Visible Marker (Component #18) to a single lane on
each gel.  For use, take 10 µL of size marker and add 4 µL loading buffer (5X).

Load 14 µL per lane.  Visible marker bands are detected after ethidium bromide staining of the agarose gel.

Concentration and Storage:    The  visible  marker  is  supplied  at  18.5  ng/µL  in  a  mixture  of  10  mM  Tris  and  0.2 mM
Na2EDTA with 0.1 % SDS.  Reagents may be stored at 4 °C for (3 to 6) months or at -20 °C for long term storage.
Reagents may look turbid due to 0.1 % SDS.  Turbidity may be eliminated by warming reagents to 37 °C for (5 to
10) min.

Packaging and Usage:  The visible size marker ladder is packaged at 10 µg of digested Adenovirus at a concentration
of 18.5 ng/µL.  This is enough for 34 gels, using one visible marker lane per gel using a loading of 185 ng.

K562 Cell Pellet, 3 x 106  Cells
Component #12

Storage Conditions:  Store at -70 °C

Description:    The  DNA  prepared  from  K562  cells  is  widely  used  as  an  allelic  control  in  human  DNA  typing
applications.  The K562 cell line is derived from a pleural effusion of a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia [5].
The cell line has been extensively studied and characterized for over 15 years, particularly for its erythroid properties
[1,2,4,6,10].  Each lot of K562 cells is tested for genetic integrity by extracting the DNA from the cells and measuring
the allele sizes obtained in a Southern blot assay with VNTR probes.  This product is intended as a control for DNA
typing applications and is not a viable source for cell culture stocks.

Quality Control:  K562 DNA was isolated bv the protocol described in Reference [11].  One µg of isolated K562 DNA
was then digested with endonuclease Hae III, electrophoresed through an agarose gel, transferred to a Biodyne® B
nylon membrane, and hybridized with DNA probes D4SI39 (PH30) [7] and D2S44 (YNH24) [8].  The bands were sized
using the BRL DNA Analysis Marker System.

Specification:

After an overnight exposure, only two bands are present per probe within ± 2.5 % of the accepted
allelic sizes [9].

Values Obtained:*

PH30 band #1: 6600 bp
PH30 band #2: 3478 bp

YNH24 band #1: 2956 bp
YNH24 band #2: 1819 bp

*Initially tested by Life Technologies, Inc.  Note that these are not the certified values.

Procedure:  The K562 cell pellet was resuspended in 375 µL 0.2 M sodium acetate and vortexed for (1 to 2) s. 25 µL 10
% sodium dodecyl sulfate and 5 µL 20 mg/mL Proteinase K were then added.  The suspension was vortexed 1 s and
then incubated at 56 °C for 1 h. Phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (120  µL)  was  added,  and  the  sample  mixed  by
gently vortexing for 30 s. The phases were separated by centrifugation for 2 min. The aqueous (upper) phase was
transferred  to  a  clean  tube,  and  the  nucleic  acid  was  precipitated  by  the  addition  of  1.0  mL  cold  (-20  °C)  ethanol.
After storage at -20 °C for 1 h, the DNA was collected by centrifugation for 30 s. The DNA pellet was dissolved in
180 µL 10 mM Tris pH 7.5 1 mM EDTA (TE) by incubating for 10 min at 65 °C.  The DNA was precipitated again by
adding 20 µL 2.0 M sodium acetate followed by 500 mL ethanol.  Following centrifugation, the pellet was washed with
1 mL 70 % ethanol.  The pellet was dried and dissolved by incubation in 200 µL TE overnight at 65 °C.  The DNA was
digested with Hae III (BRL Cat. No. 5205SA) using the conditions on the Product Profile ®.  The Hae III-digested DNA
was electrophoresed in 1 % agarose gels.  The DNA was transferred to Pall Biodyne® B membranes in 0.5 M NaOH,
0.5 M NaCl for 4 h at room temperature.  The DNA probes PH30 and YNH24 were labeled to a specific activity > 109
dpm/ µg  using  a  Random  Primers  DNA  Labeling  System.    Two  identical  membranes  were  prepared,  and  each  was
hybridized to one probe according to the method of Budowle and Baechtel [3].  Hybridization was performed at a
probe  concentration  of  5  x  105  cpm/mL  at  65  °C  for  (16  to  24)  h.  Post-hybridization  washes  were  in  a  solution
containing 0.3 M NaCl, 0.03 M sodium citrate, and 0.1 % SDS at room temperature, followed by a solution containing
0.015 M NaCl, 0.0015 M sodium citrate, and 0.1 % SDS at 65 °C. The membranes were exposed to Kodak XAR film
with a Cronex® Lighting Plus Intensifying screen at -80 °C.
