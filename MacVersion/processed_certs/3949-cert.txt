Folate Vitamers in Frozen Human Serum 

 
cermining  folate  vitamers  in 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended for use in validating methods for determining folate vitamers in 
human  serum,  and  for  qualifying  in-house  control  materials  analyzed  using  those  methods.    A  unit  of  SRM 3949 
consists of one vial each of three materials: low (Level 1), medium (Level 3), and high (Level 2) folates.  Each vial 
contains approximately 1.0 mL of frozen human serum. 
 
Certified values are provided in Table 1.  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence 
in  that  all  known  or  suspected  sources  of  bias  have  been  evaluated [1,2].    Metrological  traceability  is  to  the 
measurement units realized through purity determinations of the primary standards employed in the NIST methods.

(a) Values are expressed as x ± U95%(x), where x is the certified value and U95%(x) is the expanded uncertainty of the certified value.  
The  true  value  of  the  analyte  is  believed  to  lie  within  the  interval  x ± U95%(x)  with  95 %  confidence.    To  propagate  this 
uncertainty, treat the certified value as a normally distributed random variable with mean x and standard deviation U95%(x)/2. 
(b) Mass  concentration  values  were  calculated  from  mass  fractions  using  measured  serum  densities:    Level  1,  1.02332  g/mL; 

Level 2, 1.02376 g/mL; Level 3, 1.02435 g/mL. 

(c) Amount concentration values, nmol/L, are calculated from mass concentration results, nanogram per milliliter, via multiplication 
ion 
by 1000/M, where M is the molar mass, grams per mole, of the analyte.  These  molar  masses are: Mfolic  acid = 441.40 g/mol,  
M5-methyltetrahydrofolate = 459.46 g/mol. 

 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 3949 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until  31 August 2023,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  given  in  this 
certificate.  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the

NOTICE AND WARNINGS TO USERS 
 
SRM 3949  IS  INTENDED  FOR  RESEARCH  USE.    THIS  IS  A  HUMAN  SOURCE  MATERIAL.    HANDLE 
PRODUCT  AS  A  BIOHAZARDOUS  MATERIAL  CAPABLE  OF  TRANSMITTING  INFECTIOUS  DISEASE.  
The supplier of this serum has reported that each donor unit of serum or plasma used in the preparation of this product 
has been tested by a FDA-approved method and found non-reactive/negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg), 
human  immunodeficiency  virus (HIV)  1 and 2  antibodies,  and  hepatitis C  virus (HCV).    However,  no  known  test 
method can offer complete assurance that hepatitis B virus, HCV, HIV, or other infectious agents are absent from this 
material.    Accordingly,  this  human  blood-based  product  should  be  handled  at  the  Biosafety  Level 2  or  higher  as 
recommended for any POTENTIALLY INFECTIOUS HUMAN SERUM OR BLOOD SPECIMEN in the Centers 
for Disease Control/National Institutes of Health Manual [3].   
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
Storage  and  Handling:    Until  required  for  use,  SRM 3949  should  be  stored  in  the  dark  at  a  temperature  below  
–60 °C.  
 
Use:  SRM 3949 is provided as a set of three vials of frozen serum that should be allowed to thaw at room temperature 
for at least 30 min under subdued light.  The contents of a vial should then be gently mixed prior to removal of a test 
portion for analysis.  Precautions should be taken to avoid exposure to strong ultraviolet (UV) light and direct sunlight.  
The certification only applies to the initial use, and the same results are not guaranteed if the remaining material is 
used at a later date.  NIST strives to maintain the SRM inventory supply, but NIST cannot guarantee the continued or 
continuous supply of any specific SRM.  Accordingly, NIST encourages the use of this SRM as a benchmark for the 
quality and accuracy of the user’s in-house reference materials and working standards.  As such, the SRM should be 
used  to  validate  the  more  routinely  used  reference  materials  in  a  laboratory.    Comparisons  between  the  SRM  and 
in-house  reference  materials  or  working  measurement  standards  should  take  place  at  intervals  appropriate  to  the 
conservation of the SRM and the stability of relevant in-house materials.  For further guidance on how this approach 
can be implemented, see reference 4 or contact NIST by email at srms@nist.gov. 
 
 
SOURCE, PREPARATION, AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Source: This SRM was developed after an appropriate human subjects research determination by NIST.  Support for 
the  development  of  SRM  3949  was  provided  in  part  by  the  National  Institutes  of  Health (NIH)  Office  of  Dietary 
Supplements (ODS). 
 
NIST Analytical Approach for Determination of Folates (NIST ID-LC-MS/MS Method 1):  For simultaneous 
measurement  of  folic  acid,  5-methyltetrahydrofolate,  tetrahydrofolate,  5-formyltetrahydrofolate,  and  MeFox,  an 
isotope-dilution  liquid  chromatography  tandem  mass  spectrometry (ID-LC-MS/MS)  method  was  used  to  measure 
folate  forms  in  SRM  3949 [5].    The  method  quantifies  folic  acid,  5-methyltetrahydrofolate,  tetrahydrofolate, 
5-formyltetrahydrofolate, 
of 
4-α-hydroxy-5-methyltetrahydrofolate (MeFox).  To prepare samples for analysis, serum (275 µL) was mixed with 
ammonium formate buffer and an internal standard mixture that contained 13C5-labeled folate forms.  Sample clean-up 
was performed using 100 mg phenyl sorbent solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridges.  Samples were eluted from the 
SPE  cartridges  with  an  organic  elution  solvent  containing  both  ascorbic  acid  and  acetic  acid  and  analyzed  by 
LC-MS/MS in positive ion mode using electrospray ionization coupled to a LC system.  Chromatographic separation 
was achieved using a C8 analytical column with an isocratic mobile phase and a total run time of 10 min.  Quantitation 
was performed by peak area ratio (analyte to internal standard) and based on a 6-point aqueous calibration curve where 
calibrants  were  carried  through  all  sample  preparation  steps.    For  certified  values,  the  purity  of  neat 
5-methyltetrahydrofolate calibrant material was determined at NIST using LC-absorbance and the purity of neat folic 
acid  calibrant  material  was  determined  at  NIST  using  quantitative  protein  nuclear  magnetic  resonance 
spectroscopy (1H-qNMR).

(1) Certain  commercial  equipment,  instruments  or  materials  are  identified  in  this  certificate  to  adequately  specify  the 
experimental procedure.  Such identification does not imply recommendation or endorsement by the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the purpose.

Second NIST  Analytical Approach for Determination of Folic Acid (NIST ID-LC-MS/MS Method 2):  As a 
second approach to the measurement of folic acid, a variation of ID-LC-MS/MS was used to measure only folic acid 
in SRM 3949.  To prepare samples for analysis, serum (300 µL) was mixed with ammonium formate buffer, and an 
internal standard mixture that contained 13C5-labeled folic acid.  Sample clean-up was performed using 100 mg phenyl 
sorbent SPE cartridges.  Samples were eluted from the SPE cartridges with an organic elution solvent containing acetic 
acid  and  analyzed  by  LC-MS/MS (different  system  than  NIST  ID-LC-MS/MS  Method 1  approach  for  folates)  in 
positive ion mode using electrospray ionization coupled to a LC system.  Chromatographic separation was achieved 
using a C18 analytical column with a gradient mobile phase and a total run time of 20 min.  Quantitation was performed 
by peak area ratio (analyte to internal standard) and based on a bracketed, matching aqueous calibration approach in 
which  each  calibrant  was  carried  through  all  sample  preparation  steps.    Purity  of  neat  calibrant  material  was 
determined at NIST using 1H-qNMR. 
 
Analyses by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:  An ID-LC-MS/MS method was used to measure 
folate  forms  in  SRM  3949 [5–8].    The  method  quantifies  folic  acid,  5-methyltetrahydrofolate,  tetrahydrofolate, 
5-formyltetrahydrofolate, 
of 
4-α-hydroxy-5-methyltetrahydrofolate (MeFox).  To prepare samples for analysis, serum (150 µL) was mixed with 
ammonium formate buffer and an internal standard mixture that contained 13C5-labeled folate forms.  Sample clean-up 
was performed using a 50 mg phenyl SPE 96-well plate and an automated 96-probe SPE system.  Samples were eluted 
from  the  SPE  plate  with  an  organic  elution  solvent  containing  ascorbic  acid  and  acetic  acid  and  analyzed  by 
LC-MS/MS in positive ion mode using electrospray ionization coupled to a LC system.  Chromatographic separation 
was achieved using a C8 analytical column with an isocratic mobile phase and a total run time of 7 min.  Quantitation 
was performed by peak area ratio (analyte to internal standard) and based on a 5-point aqueous calibration curve where 
calibrants were carried through all sample preparation steps. 
 
Homogeneity Assessment:  The homogeneity of all folates was assessed at NIST using the methods and test portions 
described above and found no significant variance. 
 
Value Assignment:    Value  assignment  of  the  concentration  of  folic  acid  in  SRM 3949  Level 1  was  based  on  the 
combination of results provided from NIST ID-LC-MS/MS Method 2 and from ID-LC-MS/MS at the CDC.  Value 
assignment  of  folic  acid  in  SRM 3949  Level  2  and  Level  3  was  based  on  the  combination  of  results  from  NIST 
ID-LC-MS/MS Method 1, NIST ID-LC-MS/MS Method 2, and ID-LC-MS/MS at the CDC.  Value assignment of the 
concentrations  of  5-methyltetrahydrofolate,  tetrahydrofolate (except  for  Level  1),  5-formyltetrahydrofolate,  and 
MeFox  are  based  on  the  results  from  NIST  ID-LC-MS/MS  Method  1  and  ID-LC-MS/MS  at  the  CDC.    The 
tetrahydrofolate value assignment of Level 1 was based on the results of one analytical method at NIST ID-LC-MS/MS 
Level 1.  Value assignment of total folate was based on results from ID-LC-MS/MS at the CDC.
