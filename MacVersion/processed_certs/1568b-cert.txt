This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended primarily for validation of methods for determining elements in 
rice flour and similar materials.  This SRM can also be used for quality assurance when assigning values to in-house 
reference materials.  This SRM is rice flour prepared from a single lot of river rice by a commercial manufacturer.  A 
unit of SRM 1568b consists of a single bottle containing approximately 50 g of material sealed inside an aluminized 
pouch. 
 
Certified  Mass  Fraction  Values:    The  certified  mass  fraction  values  of  selected  elements  in  SRM 1568b  are 
provided  in  Tables 1  and  2.    A  NIST  certified  value  is  a  value  for  which  NIST  has  the  highest  confidence  in  its 
 
w
accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [1].  Analyses 
w
for  value  assignment  were  performed  by NIST and the National Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ).  Values are 
reported on a dry-mass basis in mass fraction units [2]. 
 
Reference Mass Fraction Values:  Reference mass fraction values are provided for additional elements (Table 3).  
A  NIST  reference  value  is  a  noncertified  value  that  is  the  best  estimate  of the true value based on available data; 
however, the value does not meet the NIST criteria for certification [1] and is provided with associated uncertainties 
that may reflect only measurement reproducibility, may not include all sources of uncertainty, or may reflect a lack 
of  sufficient  statistical  agreement  among  multiple  analytical  methods.    The  reference  mass  fraction  values  were 
derived from results reported by NIST.  Values are reported on a dry-mass basis in mass fraction units [2]. 
 
Expiration  of  Certification:    The  certification  of  SRM 1568b  is  valid,  within  the  measurement  uncertainty 
specified, until 20 June 2023, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given in 
this  certificate  (see  “Instructions  for  Storage  and  Use”).    The  certification  is  nullified  if  the  SRM  is  damaged, 
contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance  of  SRM  Certification:    NIST  will  monitor  this  SRM  over  the  period  of  its  certification.    If 
substantive  technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will 
notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
Coordination  of  the  technical  measurements  leading  to  the  certification  of  this  SRM  was  performed  by  W.C. Davis, 
S.E. Long, and L.J. Wood of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division.  
 
Analytical measurements at NIST were performed by B.M. Adair, S. Christopher, W.C. Davis, S.E. Long, A.F. Marlow, 
A.J. Moors, K.E. Murphy, R. Oflaz, J.R. Sieber, L.J. Wood, T.W. Vetter, and L.L. Yu of the NIST Chemical Sciences 
Division.  Analyses for value assignment were also performed by T. Narukawa of the National Metrology Institute 
of  Japan (NMIJ).    Original  analyses  were  performed  by  E.S. Beary,  T.A. Butler,  M.S. Epstein,  J.D. Fassett, 
R.R. Greenberg,  L.B. Jassie,  W.R. Kelly,  H.M. Kingston,  J.R. Moody,  P.J. Paulsen,  T.C. Rains,  T.A. Rush, 
S.F. Heller-Zeisler, R.L. Watters, Jr., and L.J. Wood.  
 
Statistical analysis was provided by J.H. Yen of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division.

NOTICE AND WARNING TO USERS 
 
SRM 1568b IS INTENDED FOR LABORATORY USE ONLY, NOT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION.   
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE AND USE 
 
Storage:    The  SRM  should  be  stored  at  controlled  room  temperature  (20 °C to 25 °C)  in  the  original  unopened 
bottle.  For elemental analyses, the bottle can be re-capped, stored at controlled room temperature (20 °C to 25 °C), 
and test portions removed and analyzed until the material reaches its expiration date. 
 
‘ttle  for  one  minute
Use:  Before use, the contents of the bottle should be mixed thoroughly.  Allow the contents to settle for one minute 
prior to opening to minimize the loss of fine particles.  To relate analytical determinations to the certified values in 
this  Certificate  of  Analysis,  the  sample  test  portion  indicated  in  the  description  of  each  group  of  analytes  below 
should be used.  Results obtained in analyses should include their own estimates of uncertainty and can be compared 
to the certified values using procedures described in reference [3].  
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR DRYING 
 
Residual moisture content should be determined on a separate sample for converting analytical results to a dry mass 
basis.  The recommended drying methods are (1) freeze drying at 25 °C for 24 h; (2) oven drying at 90 °C for 2 h; or 
(3) desiccator drying over magnesium perchlorate for 28 days.  The observed moisture content ranges from 6.1 % to 
6.4 % (mass fraction).  
  
SOURCE, PREPARATION, AND ANALYSIS(1)  
 
Source and Preparation:  Material existing from production of SRM 1568a was used to produce SRM 1568b.  
SRM 1568b is rice flour produced from 100 % long grain river rice grown in Arkansas.  The original rice flour was 
ground to pass through a 425 μm (40 mesh) sieve, blended, and bottled at NIST.  The reprocessed material was dried 
for  24 h  at  101 °C  and  then  double  blended  using  a  ceramic-lined  cone  blender for 30 min.  Using a Teflon-lined 
hopper  and  trough,  50 g  quantities  of  material  were  placed  in  4 oz  amber  bottles.    The  bottles  were  capped  and 
individually sealed in aluminized bags.  Prior to bottling, the rice flour was irradiated with 2.5 megarads of 60Co by 
Neutron Products, Inc. (Dickerson, MD). 
 
Analytical  Approach  for  Determination  of  Elements:    Assigned  mass  fraction  values  for  the  elements  in 
SRM 1568b  were  based  on  the  combination  of  measurements  from  two  different  analytical  methods  at  NIST  and 
NMIJ, where available.  Where certified values from SRM 1568a were considered scientifically valid, the combined 
estimator  is  the  mean  of  two  methods,  one  from  the  new  data  and  the  other  from  the  certified  value  from 
inductively  coupled  plasma  optical  emission

coupled  plasma  mass  spectrometry (IC/ICP-MS),  sector  field  inductively  coupled  plasma  mass  spectrometry 
(SF-ICP-MS), and wavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (WDXRF).   
 
NIST  Analyses  for  Al,  As,  Cu,  Mn,  Mo,  Rb,  Se,  and  Na  Using  ICP-OES,  SF-ICP-MS,  and/or  ICP-MS:  
Aluminum, arsenic, copper, manganese, molybdenum, rubidium, selenium, and sodium were measured by ICP-OES, 
SF-ICP-MS or ICP-MS using duplicate 0.5 g test portions taken from each of eight bottles of SRM 1568b.  Samples 
were digested in nitric acid using a microwave sample preparation system.  Quantification was based on the method 
of standard additions.   
 
NIST Analyses for Pb Using Isotope Dilution ICP-MS:  Lead was measured by ID-ICP-MS using duplicate 1.0 g 
test portions taken from each of six bottles of SRM 1568b.  Samples were spiked with isotopically enriched  206Pb 
and were digested in nitric acid using a microwave sample preparation system.  Sample digests were evaporated to 
near dryness and a portion was reconstituted in dilute nitric acid for Pb analysis.

NIST  Analyses  for  Al,  Br,  Ca,  Cl,  Fe,  Mg,  Mn,  P,  K,  Rb,  S,  and  Zn  Using  WDXRF:    Aluminum,  bromine, 
calcium,  chlorine,  iron,  magnesium,  manganese, phosphorus, potassium, rubidium, sulfur, and zinc were measured 
by WDXRF using duplicate or triplicate 2.5 g test portions taken from each of 24 bottles of SRM 1568b.  Briquettes 
were prepared for each sample.  The K-L2,3 characteristic X-ray lines of all elements were used for quantification.   
 
NIST Analyses for Br, Mn, K, and Na Using INAA:  Bromine, manganese, potassium, and sodium were measured 
by INAA using duplicate 0.25 g test portions taken from each of six bottles of SRM 1568b.  Powders were pressed 
into cylindrical pellets and irradiated in the pneumatic tube RT-2 of the NIST reactor at a reactor power of 20 MW.  
Samples,  standards,  and  controls  were  packaged  individually  in  clean  polyethylene  bags  for  analysis  using 
gamma-ray spectroscopy.  The count was done after several hours decay at a sample-to-detector distance of 5 cm for 
30 min counting time.   
 
NIST Analyses for As Species Using LC/MS/MS and IC/ICP-MS:  Dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), methylarsonic 
acid (MMA),  and  As (III)  and  As (V),  reported  as  inorganic  arsenic (iAs),  were  measured  by  IC/ICP-MS  using 
duplicate  1 g  test  portions  taken  from  each  of  eight  total  bottles  of  SRM 1568b.    DMA  was  also  analyzed  by 
LC/MS/MS using duplicate 1 g test portions taken from each of six bottles of SRM 1568b.  Samples were prepared 
in a methanol/water mixture using a microwave sample preparation system.  Quantification was based on the method 
of  standard  additions.    NMIJ  reported  individual  results  for  DMA,  MMA,  As (III),  and  As (V)  using  IC/ICP-MS.  
For analytes that were measured by NIST and NMIJ, the combination of the mean results from analyses by NIST and 
the mean results provided by NMIJ were averaged, as appropriate. 
 
Homogeneity Assessment:  The homogeneity of elements was assessed at NIST from methods and test portion sizes 
described above.  For the elements measured by NIST, analyses of variance with 5 % significance level did not show 
statistically significant heterogeneity with the exception of Pb.  A pattern of heterogeneity in the Pb data was evident, 
so the uncertainty for Pb incorporates an uncertainty component for possible heterogeneity. 
 
determined  to 
Value Assignment:  The SRM 1568a material was re-examined and the original certified values were determined to 
be scientifically valid in some cases.  Where the data were determined to be valid, new NIST values were combined 
with values from SRM 1568a.  The combined estimator is the mean of the new NIST data and the certified value for 
SRM 1568a.  In the case of cadmium and mercury, the data from the original SRM 1568a were considered valid and 
the combination of the mean of results from analyses by NIST for SRM 1568a were used for certification.  Original 
SRM 1568a  data  were  determined  using  the  following  methods:  heated  graphite  atomizer  (electrothermal)  atomic 
absorption 
emission 
spectrometry (FES),  flow  injection  analysis  cold  vapor  atomic  absorption  spectrometry (FIA-CV-AAS),  hydride 
generation  atomic  absorption  spectrometry 
inductively  coupled  plasma  optical  emission 
spectrometry (ICP-OES), thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS), isotope dilution inductively coupled plasma 
mass spectrometry (ID-ICP-MS), instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA), radiochemical neutron activation 
analysis (RNAA), and spectrophotometry (SPECTRO). 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values for Selected Elements:  Each certified mass fraction value is the mean from the 
combination  of  the  mean  of  results  from  analyses  by  NIST  or  the  combination  of  mean  results  from  analyses  by 
NIST and the certificate value from SRM 1568a treated as a method estimate, where appropriate.  The uncertainty 
provided  with  each  value  is  an  expanded  uncertainty  about  the  mean  to  cover  the  measurand  with  approximately 
95 % confidence.  The expanded uncertainty is calculated as U = kuc, where uc incorporates the observed difference 
between the results from the methods and their respective uncertainties and an uncertainty component for moisture 
correction, consistent with the ISO/JCGM Guide and with its Supplement 1, and k is a coverage factor corresponding 
to approximately 95 % confidence [4–6]. 
 
Metrological Traceability:  The measurand in each case is the total concentration of each analyte as described in 
the text.  Metrological traceability is to the SI unit indicated for each analyte in Tables 1-3, respectively.
