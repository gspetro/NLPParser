These  Standard  Reference  Materials  (SRM’s)  are  intended  primarily  for  use  in  evaluating  the  performance  of  air 
sampling  filter  methods  wherein  dust,  particulates,  aerosols,  mists,  etc.  are  collected  by  passing  a  known  volume  of 
air  through  a 
analyzed  at  NBS  using  technique  and  methods  generally  employed  in  the  NBS  certification  procedures.  Thirty-one 
constituent  elements,  including  some  listed  as  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA)  priority  pollutants,  were 
determined  and  or  analyzed  in  the  three  different  filter  types  or  sizes  that  are  commonly  used  in  air  sampling  of  in- 
dustrial  atmospheres.  For  information  only,  the  filter  types  and  descriptions  are  listed  below.

The  filters  were  analyzed  for  constituent  elements  using  instrumental  neutron  activation  analysis  (INAA)  and  for 
leachable  cations  and  anions  using  ion  chromatography  (IC).  The  leachable  constituent  elements  were  brought  into 
solution  using  a  standardized  procedure  (see  Ion  Chromatography  under  Analysis  Section). 

The  certified  values  presented  as  tolerance  intervals  for  these  SRM’s  are  given  in  Tables  1  and  2.  Two-sided  tolerance 
intervals  for  the  constituent  elements  are  given  whenever  possible  and  one-sided  tolerance  intervals  are  given  for 
the  constituent  elements  for  which  the  data  would  not  support  two-sided  intervals.  In  cases  where  a  constituent  ele- 
ment  was  not  detected,  a  limit  of  detection  (Xp)  is  given  based  on  conditions  and  sensitivity  of  the  technique 
employed.  (See  Definitions.) 

The  statistical  analysis  of  the  data  for  these  SRM’s  was  performed  by  S.B.  Schiller  and  K.R.  Eberhardt  of  the  Statis- 
tical  Engineering  Division. 

Analyses  for  certification  were  performed  in  the  Inorganic  Analytical  Research  Division  by  L.A.  Holland,  W.F. 
Koch,  K.W.  Pratt,  S.F.  Stone,  and  R.  Zeisler. 

The  technical  and  support  aspects  involved  in  the  preparation,  certification,  and  issuance  of  this  Standard  Reference 
Material  were  coordinated  through  the  Office  of  Standard  Reference  Materials  by  T.E.  Gills.

Notice  and  Recommended  Use:  These  SRM’s  are  commercial  filters  that  were  not  treated  or  washed  before  analysis. 
The  variation  in  concentration  levels  of  the  constituent  elements  may  or  may  not  be  typical  of  the  variability  found 
in  similar  commercial  filters,  as  production  and  treatment  processes  do  differ.  However,  NBS  has  characterized 
each  of  the  three  SRM  lots  to  give  the  user  a  stated  confidence  level  for  the  range  of  concentration  levels  of  con- 
stituent  elements.  Thus  the  user  can  use  the  filters  to  accurately  assess  the  magnitude  of  blank  levels  of  the  air  in 
the  workplace  or  industrial  environment.

Analysis 
Instrumental  Neutron  Activation  Analysis  (INAA):  The  filters  were  pelletized  using  a  cleaned  pellet  press,  and 
packaged  in  acid-cleaned  linear  polyethylene  film.  The  analysis  procedure  used  was  the  general  INAA  scheme, 
using  a  comparator  technique  with  appropriate  standards  and  control  samples  [1]. 

Ion  Chromatography:  The  filters  were  analyzed  for  soluble  chloride,  fluoride,  nitrate,  sulfate,  sodium,  and  potas- 
sium  using  ion  chromatography.  Individual  filters  were  covered  in  polyethylene  vessels  using  distilled,  deionized 
water.  The  samples  were  then  placed  in  an  ultrasonic  bath  for  periods  of  15  minutes  (SRM’s  2678,  2680)  and  for 
30  minutes  (SRM  2681)  to  assure  complete  dissolution  of  the  soluble  species.  Shorter  times  less  than  those  listed 
above  yielded  low,  variable  results. 

The  cations  and  anions  were  determined  simultaneously  using  a  two  channel  ion  chromatograph  and  ion  chromatog- 
raphy  software  for  peak  integration.

Definitions: 

Limit  of  detection  (Xp):  The  Xp  refers  to  the  underlying  true  analyte  concentration  that  the  employed  chemical 
measurement  process  is  capable  of  detecting.  [Ref:  "Detection  in  Analytical  Chemistry  -  Importance,  Theory,  and 
Practice,"  ACS  Symposium  Series  361,  pp  10,  Lloyd  A.  Currie,  Editor,  1988.] 

Two-sided  Tolerance  Interval: 
A  two-sided  tolerance  interval  was  computed  for  those  constituent  elements  in 
which  no  “less  than"  results  were  reported.  The  computed  two-sided  tolerance  intervals  are  constructed,  at  the 
90%  confidence  level,  to  cover  the  analyte  concentrations  of  90%  of  the  population  of  filters.  These  intervals  were 
computed  as  X  +  (2.077)s  for 
n=25  and  X  +  (2.065)s  for  n=26,  after  the  data  were  first  converted  to  logarith- 
mic  scale. 

” 

One-sided  Tolerance  Interval  (interval  from  0  to  some  limit):  For  elements  that  had  one  or  more  "less  than"  values 
in  the  measurement  data,  a  one-sided  upper  tolerance  interval  was  computed  using  a  nonparametric  method.  [Ref.: 
Natrella,  Mary  G.,  Experimental  Statistics,  National  Bureau  of  Standards  Handbook  91,  U.S.  Government  Print- 
ing  Office,  1966,  page  2-15.]  These  intervals,  which  extend  from  0  to  the  maximum  observed  concentration,  are 
also  constructed  to  cover  90%  of  the  population  of  filters  at  a  confidence  level  of  90%.
