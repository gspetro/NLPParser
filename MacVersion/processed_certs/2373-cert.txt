This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is for use to assign  ratios of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 
gene (HER2, the official gene  symbol ERBB2) to unamplified reference genes .  Measurements of the amplification 
(increased copies) of the HER2 gene in breast cancer samples are used as a biomarker for determining the classification 
and the best treatment for breast cancers [1].  SRM 2373 consists of genomic DNA extracted from five breast cancer 
cell lines with different amounts of amplification of the HER2 gene.  The five purified genomic DNAs were solubilized 
in a buffer consisting of  10 mmol/L tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane and 0.1  mmol/L ethylenediaminetetraacetic 
acid disodium salt (EDTA) pH 8.0 (TE-4).  The five components are genomic DNA materials derived from human cell 
lines SK-BR-3, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-361, MDA-MB-453, and BT-474, labeled A, B, C, D, and E, respectively.  
A unit of SRM 2373 consists of five vials, one of each component, containing approximately 100 μL of DNA solution.  
Each of these vials is labeled and is sealed with a color-coded screw cap. 
 
Certified Values:  Certified ratios of HER2 copies per reference genes are shown in Table 1.  Certified ratios of HER2 
copies per reference genes with   the 95  % uncertainty intervals  and  prediction  intervals at 68  % confidence (one 
standard d eviation) are  also  shown  in Table 1.   A NIST  certified  value is a value for which NIST has the highest 
confidence in its accuracy in 
stigated or taken into 
account [2].   
 
Information Values:  Information values for  HER2 and four Reference Genes Copies  are shown in Tables 2 and 3.  
While measurements were done using the four reference genes, the 
information values were determined using data 
from the three reference genes that had the best agreement [3].  A NIST information value is considered to be a value 
that will be of interest and use t o the SRM user, but insufficient information is available to assess the un
certainty 
associated with the value or only a limited number of analyses were performed [2].  Information values cannot be used 
to establish metrological traceability.   
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 2373 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until 30 November 2020, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instruct
ions given in this 
certificate (see “Instructions for Storage and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, 
or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If subst antive 
technical  changes occur that affect the certification before the expiration of
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Overall direction and coordination of the technical  measurements leading to the certification of SRM  2373  were 
provided by K.D. Cole and S. Choquette of the NIST Biosystems and Biomaterials Division.   
 
Sample preparation and analytical measurements were do
ne by H .-J. He, K.D.  Cole,  J. Almeida  of the NIST 
Biosystems and Biomaterials   Division.  Additional measurements were supplied by  S. Maragh and J. Kralj  of the 
NIST Biosystems and Biomaterials Division, and D. Catoe and C.R. Hill both formerly of NIST.  
 
Statistical consultation was provided by S. Lund of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division.

bottles,  differences among suitable reference genes,

The values in Table  1 come from fitting a statistical model to the measurements made on the  SRM 2373 materials 
using both digital and quantitative PCR  methods.  The Bayesian paradigm  with vague priors was used for statistical 
inference [5].  The expan ded uncertainty is an interval calculated in a manner consistent with 
the ISO/JCGM 
Guide [6], and it expresses contributions from all recognized sources of uncertainty, in cluding differences between 
analytical methods and operators, differences among 
  and 
dispersion of values resulting from sample preparation and replicated measur ement.  The nominal  coverage for the 
interval is 95 % and can be interpreted in the following manner.   The average gene copy rat io between  HER2 and 
suitable reference gene s (examples of  suitable reference genes are identified in Table  4) among all bottles  prepared 
for this SRM lies  within  the  provided uncertainty   interval with approximately 95  % confidence.   The p rediction 
intervals provide the approximate range of values NIST would reasonably expect upon t he next single, independent 
measurement of the  HER2  copy number ratio for each of the five components, based upon the measurement 
performance of NIST analysts and instruments.  The value would be expected to fall within the interval approximately 
68 % of the time. 
 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS(1)
 
 
Sample Preparation:  NIST SRM 2373 consists of genomic DNA samples prepared from  five human breast cancer 
cell lines.    After the ini tial extraction using the Zymo Quick -gDNA™ midiPrep kit (Zymo   Research Corporation, 
Irvine, CA), the samples were pre-treated with bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A before re-extraction [7].  All purified 
genomic DNA samples were dissolved or eluted in TE -4  buffer (10 mmol/L Tris, 0.1  mmol/L EDTA, pH  8.0) and 
stored at 4 ºC. The DNA samples from the cell lines were genotyped u sing STR analysis and the results agree with 
the values provided by the cell line repository. 
 
qPCR data analysis:  The qPCR assays for  HER2 and reference genes were developed according to The Minimum 
Information for Publication of Quantitative Real -Time PCR Experiments  (MIQE) guidelines [8].  The primers and 
probes for the HER2 and reference genes for the qPCR assays are listed in Table 4.  The efficiency and specificity of 
the assays were determined [9].  Using a calibration curve based quantitation method, the HER2 gene copies and the 
copies of the  reference genes were quantified by external standard curves  assays using individual PCR assays and 
SYBER® Green master mix.  The qPCR data was evaluated using SRM  2372 component A as a calibrant to produce 
standard curves.  SRM 2372 component A, produced from a single male donor, was shown to contain  a single copy 
of HER2 gene per haploid genome.  The absorbance of SRM  2372 component A is a certified value and the DNA 
mass concentration derived from the absorbance value is  an information value, because the conversion is done using 
a factor of uncharacterized uncert ainty.  The followin g assumptions were used:  (1) SRM 2372 component A has a 
DNA concentration of 57 ng/µL (information value from the Certificate of Analysis) [10]; (2) There are three hundred 
and thirty-three copies of single -copy genes in 1  ng of human g enomic DNA.   HER2 and the reference gene copy 
number were obtained by  qPCR assays by comparing the Cq  (Quantitation Cycle from the qPCR instrument) of the 
samples with their respective standard curves.   
 
and  negative
ve and negative 
dPCR Assays :  MIQE guidelines for dPCR were followed and include sample replicates, positi
controls, and proper documentation [11].  TaqMan probes are shown in Table 5.  BHQ-1™ (Black hole quencher) and 
FAM labeled probes were obtained from  Biosearch Technologies (Novato, CA).  MGB® (minor groove binder) and 
FAM labeled probes were obtained from Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA).  The calculations for DNA copy number 
were calculated using Poisson sampling statistics assuming that the  DNA molecules are partitioning independently 
from each other into the individual droplets or chambers.  We used two restricti on enzymes, RsaI and  MseI, to test 
that the DNA with high levels of HER2 amplification were partitioning as single molecules.  Treatment of the genomic 
DNA with the restriction enzymes did not increase the copy numbers obtai ned with the dPCR assays.   The results 
were obtained from assays performed by two analysts using a Bio
-Rad QX100 droplet digital PCR system ; t he 
Bio-Rad software used a droplet size of 0.91 nL for determination of DNA copy number.   
 
Homogeneity and Stability Studies:  Each of the components of SRM 2373 was distributed into 350 tubes that were 
then stored at 4  °C in the dark.  Homogeneity studies were accomplished by selecting 10
components that were distributed throughout the order of dispensing .  These vials were analyzed by both qPCR and 
dPCR methods.  Analysis of the data did not indicate any detectable changes in 
components that varied with dispensing order (given the uncertainty of the m easurements).  Stability te sting was 
conducted on the samples that were stored at 4  °C in the dark for different periods of time.  The  HER2 copy number 
or the ratio of HER2 to the reference gene RPS27A were measured by dPCR and the data did not show any significant 
changes in any of  the five components for periods of time up to 856  days, the last storage time analyzed  (given the 
uncertainty of the measurements).

Information Values:  The approximate concentration of components A, B, C, D, and E dete rmined by absorbance 
measurements at 260 nm are 23.4 µg/mL, 22.2 µg/mL, 22.3 µg/mL, 22.3 µg/mL, and 22.4 µg/mL, respectively.  The 
absorbances at 260 nm of the components (six replicates) were measured and a conversion factor (one optical density 
at 260 nm with a pathlength of 1 cm is 50 ng DNA/µL).  The approximate values are used to determine the appropriate 
dilution of the samples for use with the desired measurement technique.   It is important to consider the level of HER2 
amplification in the samples and appropriate dilutions needed to ensure t hat the  HER2 copy number is within the 
working range of the assay.   
 
Tables 2 and 3 contain the information values for the concentrations (copies per mic roliters) of the  HER2 gene and 
the reference genes in the components of SRM  2373, determined by qPCR and dPCR , respectively.  This data is a 
subset of the data used to calculate the certified ratios in Table 1.  The samples were measured using qPCR and dPCR 
using the reference genes indicated in the respective tables.
