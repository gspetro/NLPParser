The  certified  values  for  platinum,  palladium,  rhodium,  andleadwere  deternined  on  samples  thet  were  calcined  for 
2h  at  500  °C  prior  to  analysis,  end  are  based  on  results  obtained  using  inductively  coupled  plasma  mass 
spectrometry  with  isotope  dilution  quantitation  for  Pt,  Pd,  Pb,  and  intemal  standard  quantitation  for  Rh.  The  stated 
uiicertaintias  are  99%  confidence  intervals  of  the  sinele  method  means. 

NOTICE  TO  USERS 

Stability:  This  material  is  consideredto  be  stable;  however,  its  stability  has  not  been  rigorously  assessed.  MIST 
will  monitor  this  material  and  will  report  any  substantive  changes  in  certification  to  the  purchaser.  Please  return 
the  registration  card  to  facilitate  notification. 

Use:  SRM  2557  is  hygroscopic,  and  contains  some  organic  matter  absorbed  from  automotive  fuel.  To  assure  a 
stable  weighing  form  for  analysis,  the  sample  must be  ignited  for  2  h  at  500°C,  and  then  stored  in  a  desiccator 
until  the  enakytical  sample  is  weighed  out.  Homogeneity  assessments  indicate  that  analyses  performed  on  samples 
of 
0.1  2  may  be  related  to  the  certified  value,  samples  of 5  g  or  larger  are  more  typical  for  platinam  group  metal 
analyses. 

The  overall  direction  and  coordination  of  the  enabrses  for  certification  were  under  the  chairmanship  of  PJ. 
Paulsen  ancl  J  Fassett  of  the  NIST  Inorganic  Analytical  Research  Drvision  and  of  J.  Bozic  of  INCO  Ltd,  Copper 
Cliff  Ontario. 
The  mass  spectrometric  analyses  were  performed  by  ES.  Beary  and  PJ  Paulsen  of  the  NIST 
Inorganic  Research  Division. 

mbtatistical  consultation was  provided by  5.B.  Schiller  of  the  MIST  Statistical  Engineering  Drrision. 

The  techrucal  and  support  aspects  invohred  in  the  preparation,  certification,  and  issuance  of  this  SRM  were 
coordinated  through  the  Standard  Reference  Materials  Programby  J5.  Kane.

Thomas  E.  Gills,  Acting  Chief 
ntendard  Reference  Materials  Programm 

Source  and  Preparation  of  Material:  INCO  Ltd  Copper  Cliff,  Ontario,  CANADA  collected  the  matenal  for 
this  SRM  from  used  monolith  type  auto  catalysts by  reserving  2.3  ke  (5  th)  samples  from  each  of  several  batches 
of  auto  catalyst  as  it  was  being  recycled.  Fach  23  ke  G  lb)  sample  was  indraidually  pubvreried  to  less  than  74  pm 
(-200  mesh)  end  blended,  and  several  samples  were  pooled  until  more  then  136.3  kg  (00  Ib)  had  been  collected. 
The  material  was  then  shipped  to  NIST,  where  it  was  sieve-tested,  blended,  and  bottled  in  70  @  units.  Ninety-six 
randomly  selected  samples  were  withdrawn  from  the  lot  for  homogeneity  testing  and  certification  anahysis. 

Analysis:  Homogeneity  testing  for  the  certified  platinum  group  elements  and  lead  was  performed  by  high- 
precision  X-ray  fluorescence  anakysis  of  35  g  and  6 
g  samples,  and  by  imductrrely  coupled  plasma  analysis 
preceded by  fire  assay  of  4 
@  samples.  No  statistically  significant  material  variability  wes  ochserved  for  the 
elements  evaluated.  Certification  analyses  performed  at  NIST  on  0.1  geamples  also  showed no  evidence  of  sample 
heterogeneity. 

Certified  Values  and  Uncertainties:  The  certified  values  are  based  exclusrrely  on  isotope  dilution  mass 
spectrometry  (Pt,  Pd,  Pb)  of  inductively  coupled  plasina  mass  spectrometry  (Rh).  Confirmatory  analyses  were 
performed  by  instrumental  neutron  activation  &  NIST  and  X-ray  fluorescence,  inductively  coupled  plasma  atomic 
ertission  and  flame  atomuc  absoiption by  cooperating  laboratones. 

Non-ceriified  Values: 
The  non-certafied  values,  shown  below  in  parentheses,  are  grven  to  provide  additional 
information  on  the  overall  matrix  composition  of  the  SRM.  The  values  are  non-certified  becease  there  wes  not 
intermethod  agreement  or  because  they  were  determined by  only  one  analytical  method.

Addendum  to  the  Certificates 

for 

SRM  2556,  Used  Auto  Catalyst  (Pellets) 
SRM  2557,  Used  Auto  Catalyst  (Monolith) 

NIST  Standard  Reference  Materials  G@RMs)  are  used  extensrrely  for  the  evaluation  of  analytical  methods  and  the 
assessment  of  laboratory  performance.  MIST  SRMs  are  certified  at  a  relattvely  high  degree  of  accuracy  ancl  the 
uncertainties  of  the  certified  values  are  small  with  respect  to  the  intended  use. 
This  allows  one  to  test  for 
analytical  measurement  bias,  to  determine  nelytical  measurement  acceptability,  and  to  establish  statistical  control 
of  the  enabrtical  measurement  process. 

This  addencum  is  to  provide  the  users  of  these  two  automobile  catalyst  SRMs  with  information  that  can  be  used  to 
compare  NIST  certified  values  with  mean  values  cbtamed  by  the  leboratones  that  participated  in  the  round  robin 
exercises.  The  laboratories  are  identified  by  mamber  and  thei  results  reflect  variabilities  that  can  be  expected 
among  and  between  laboratories.  In  most  cases,  the  laboratories!  results  are  means  of  four  to  eight  replicates 
reported  without  any  assessment  of  systematic  error.  The  overall  interlaboratory  means  are  reported  along  with 
the  average  standard  deviation  at  one  sigma  (a). 

NIST  certified  values  should be  used  for  equipment  calibration  and/or  method  evaluation.  The  certified  values  are 
the  "best!  estimate  of  the  trae  value,  while  the  round  robin  results  provide  the  user  with  some  measure  of  the 
reproducibility  that  canbe  expected  using  more  traditional  techniques  or  methods.
