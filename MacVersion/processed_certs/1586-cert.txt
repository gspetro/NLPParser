Certificate  of  Analysis 

Standard  Reference  Material  1586 

isotopically  Labeled  and  Unlabeled 

Priority  Pollutants  in  Methanol 

This  Standard  Reference  Material  (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  use  in  the  evaluation  and  calibration  of  analytical 
instrumentation  used  for  the  determination  of  priority  pollutants  as  classified  by  the  U.S.  Environmental  Protection 
In  particular  this  SRM  may  be  used  to  calibrate  and/or  test  a  laboratory’s  use  of  EPA  Analytical 
Agency  (EPA). 
Methods  1624  and  1625  (as  well  as  624-625  and  524-525).  These  methods  specifically  require  the  use  of  combined  gas 
chromatography/mass  spectrometry  (GC/MS)  and  the  use  of  isotopically  labeled  internal  standards.  SRM  1586  is 
composed  of  two  separate  solutions.  The  ten  Priority  Pollutants  in  one  solution  (SRM  1586-2)  contain  either  deuterium 
or  carbon-13  while  the  other  solution  (SRM  1586-1)  contains  the  same  compounds  with  no  isotopes  except  those 
naturally  occurring. 

  

Certified  Values  of  Constituent  Organic  Compounds:  The  certified  values  for  the  selected  organic  constituents  are 
Shown  in  Table  1.  These  certified  values  are  based  on  results  obtained  from  the  gravimetric  preparation  of  these  solutions 
and  from  the  analytical  values  determined  by  gas  chromatography.  Table  2  summarizes  the  calculated  and  analytically 
determined  concentrations. 

Notice  and  Warnings  to  User 

  

Handling:  Priority  Pollutants  are  reported  to  be  toxic  and  should  be  handled  with  care.  Use  proper  disposal  methods. 

Expiration  of  Certification:  This  certification  is  valid,  within  the  limits  certified,  for  one  year  from  the  date  of  purchase. 
In  the  event  that  the  certification  should  become  invalid  before  then,  purchasers  will  be  notified  by  NBS. 

Storage: 

Sealed  ampoules,  as  received,  should  be  stored  in  the  dark  at  temperatures  between  10-30  °C. 

Use:  Samples  for  analysis  should  be  withdrawn  immediately  after  opening  ampoules  and  should  be  processed  without 
delay  for  the  certified  values  in  Table  |  to  be  valid  within  the  stated  uncertainty.  Certified  values  are  not  applicable  to 
material  stored  in  ampoules  that  have  been  opened,  even  if  they  are  resealed. 
Preparation  and  analytical  determinations  were  performed  at  the  Center  for  Analytical  Chemistry,  Organic  Analytical 
Research  Division,  by  F.R.  Guenther,  D.J.  Pereles,  R.E.  Rebbert,  M.J.  Welch  and  E.  White,  V. 
Consultation  on  the  statistical  design  of  the  experimental  work  was  provided  by  K.R.  Eberhardt  of  the  Statistical 
Engineering  Division. 
The  coordination  of  the  technical  measurements  leading  to  certification  was  under  the  direction  of  S.N.  Chesler  and 
W.E..  May. 
The  technical  and  support  aspects  involved  in  the  preparation,  certification,  and  issuance  of  this  Standard  Reference 
Material  were  coordinated  through  the  Office  of  Standard  Reference  Materials  by  R.  Alvarez.

Preparation  and  Analysis 

All  chemicals  used  in  the  preparation  of  SRM  1586-1  and  1586-2  were  obtained  from  commercial  sources  and  were 
deemed  the  best  available  at  the  time.  The  chemical  purities,  as  determined  by  gas  chromatography,  are  listed  in  Table  3 
and  were  used  in  the  determination  of  the  certified  values.  The  isotopic  purities  of  the  compounds  in  SRM  1586-2  as 
determined  by  mass  spectrometry  at  NBS  are  shown  inTable  4.  Both  solutions  were  prepared  at  NBS  by  weighing  and 
mixing  the  ten  individual  compounds  and  the  methanol  solvent. 
Each  solution  was  chilled  and  ampouled  into 
2  mL-amber  glass  ampoules. 
Each  ampoule  was  purged  with  nitrogen  immediately  before  adding  the  solution  and 
sealing. 
Aliquots  from  randomly  selected  ampoules  were  analyzed  by  gas  chromatography  with  flame  ionization 
detection.  A  glass  column  (2  m  x 
2  mm  I.D.),  packed  with  60/80  Carbopack  B  and  coated  with  1%  SP-1000  was  used  for 
determination  of  carbon  tetrachloride  and  benzene. 
The  internal  standard  (ES)  for  this  analysis  was  1,2-dichloro- 
propane.  A 
fused  silica  column  (30  m  x  0.25  mm  ID.  x  0.25  um  film  of  bonded  dimethyl  polysiloxane)  was  used  with 
splitless  injection  for  the  determination  of  the  other  eight  components. 
SRM  1586-1  (unlabeled),  o-xylene  was  the  IS 
for  chlorobenzene  while  6-chloro-m-cresol  was  the  IS  for  phenol,  nitrobenzene,  2-nitrophenol,  2,4-dichlorophenol  and 
naphthalene,  and  benzo(k)fluoranthene  was  the  IS  for  bis(2-ethylhexyl)  phthalate  and  benzo(a)pyrene. 
For 
SRM  1586-2  (labeled)  the  same  three  internal  standards  were  used  but  in  addition  bis(2-ethylhexy])  adipate  was  used  as 
the  IS  for  the  bis(2-ethylhexyl)  phthalate.

“For  each  compound,  the  certified  value  is  the  mean  of  the  calculated  and  chromatographic  determina- 
tions.  The  corresponding  uncertainty  represents  the  symmetric  interval  about  the  certified  value  which 
covers  the  95%  confidence  interval  from  the  chromatographic  analyses.  Thus,  the  uncertainty  reflects 
both  random  error  of  measurement  and  the  systematic  bias  between  the  calculated  and  chromato- 
graphic  values.
