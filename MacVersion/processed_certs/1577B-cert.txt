Certificate  of  Analpats 

Standard  Reference  Material  1577b 
Bovine  Liver 

This  Standard  Reference  Material  (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  use  #1  a  control  material  and  in  evaluating  analytical 
methods  for  the  determination  of  mejor,  minor,  and  trace  clements  in  animal  tissue  and  other  biological  matrices. 
Certified  Valnes  of  Conctiment  Elements:  The  certified  values  for  the  constituent  elements  are  given  in  Table  L.  Cer- 
tified  valnes 
tained  by  two  or  more  independent  analytical  methods,  Noncertified  values 
Analytical  methods  used  for  the  analysis  of  SRM  1577b,  inctuding  certified  and  informatica  values,  are  given  in  Tabie  3. 

are  based  on  results  obtained  by  definitive  methods  of  known  securacy;  of  aermalrerly  Eom  Tous 
are  provided  foe  informaton  only  m  T 

Exniration  of  Certification:  This  certification  is  mvalid  after  5  years  from  the  date  of  purchase  and  shipment  from  NIST. 
Should  any  of  the  certified  constituents  change  within  a  5-year  period  purchasers  will  be  notified  by  NIST. 
Stabiiry  The  SRM  should  be  kept  in  its  original  bottle  and  stored  between 
tence  sources  of  radiation.  The  bottle  should  be  kept  tightly  closed  and  stored  in  a  desiccator  away  from  direct  sunlight 
Use:  A  minimam  semple  of  250  mg  of  the  dried  material  (see  Instructions  for  Drying)  shoald  be  used  for  amy  analytical 
determination  to  be  related  to  the  certified  values  of  this  Certificate. 
Dissolution  procedures  should  be  designed  to  effect  complete  solution,  but  without  losses  of  volatile  elements,  such  as 
mercury.  Dissolution  for  these  determinations  thould  be  carried  oct  in  a  dosed  system. 

10-30  °C.  It  should  not  be  exposed  to  in- 

The  overall  direction  and  coordination  of  the  analyses  leading  to  this  certification  were  under  the  chairmanship  of  J.R. 
DeVoe,  Chief  of  the  lnorganic  Analytical  Rescarch  Division. 
‘The  technical  and  support  aspects  involved  in  the  preparation,  certification,  and  issuance  of  this  Standard  Reference 
Material  were  coordinated  through  the  Standard  Reference  Materials  Program  by  T-E.  Gills.

The  estimated  uncertainty  of  a  certified  value  is  the  sum  of  the  half-width  of  a  95%  confidence  interval  for  the  mean  of 
results  and  an  allowance  for  systematic  ezror,  except  for  the  uncertainty  associated  with  sulfur  which  is  based  on  scientific 
jadgment  and  is  roughly  equivalent  to  ope  pero=at  Oa  er 
ee  The  systematic  error  is  estimated  by  the  maximum 
absolute  deviation  between  a  single  method  mean  and  the  grand  mean.  The  grand  mean  was  computed  using  the  weighting 
scheme  of  Paule  and  Mande!  (NBS  Journal  of  Research  87,  pp  377-385).

for  Drying:  Samples  of  this  SRM  must  be  dried  before  weighing  according  to  the  following  procedure:  Dry 

lostructions 
for  24  hours  at  20  to  25  “C  in  a  vacumm  oven  at  a  peeature  not  greater  than  30  Px  (0.2  mm  Hg).

The  bovine  liver  for  this  standard  wes  obtained  in  the  Porthand,  Oregon  area.  The  gross  fat,  major  blood  vessek,  and  ‘skin’ 
were  removed  and  the  Iver  was  ground.  The  ground  liver  was  then  mixed,  transferred  to  polyethylene-lined  trays,  and 
lyophilized  by  Oregon  Freeze  Dry  Foods,  Inc.,  Albany,  Oregon.  After  lyophilization,  the  liver  was  powdered  m 
a  Tornado 
mull,  packaged  in  motsture-proof  bags,  ead  then  transported  to  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology.
