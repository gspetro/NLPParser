Potassium  Feldspar 
Trace  Rubidium  and  Strontium 

This  material  consists  of  a  carefully  sieved  fraction  (+200,  -325)  of  SRM  70a,  Potassium  Feld- 
spar.  It  is  intended  for  use  as  a  standard  for  the  determination  of  Rb  and  Sr  and  Sr  isotopic  ratios  as 
originally  suggested  by  Compston,  et  al.  [1].

subsamples  from  ten  different  bottles,  and  thus  include  a  term  for  sample  heterogeneity.

Samples  should  be  dried  before  use  by  heating  at  105  °C  for  two  to  four  hours  and  then  cooled 

in  a  desiccator. 

Material  homogeneity  was  determined  using  approximately  0.1g  samples.  The  rubidium  concen- 
a  comparative  standard  and  the 
tration  was  determined  using  SRM  984,  Rubidium  Chloride,  as 
strontium  concentration  and  isotopic  ratios  were  determined  using  SRM  988,  Strontium-84  spike, 
and  SRM  987,  Strontium  Carbonate,  as  comparative  standards 

The  analytical  work  was  performed  in  the  NBS  Analytical  Chemistry  Division  by  J.  R.  Moody, 

L.  J.  Moore  and  I.  L.  Barnes  under  the  direction  of  W.  R.  Shields. 

The  technical  aspects  leading  to  the  preparation,  certification,  and  issuance  of  this  material  were 

coordinated  through  the  Office  of  Standard  Reference  Materials  by  W.  P.  Reed.
