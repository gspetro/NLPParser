Standard  Reference  Material  1598 

Inorganic  Constituents  in  Bovine  Serum 

This  Standard  Reference  Material  (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  use  in  calibrating  instrumentation  and  evaluating 
the  accuracy  of  analytical  methods  for  selected  elements  in  blood  serum,  plasma,  and  similar  biological  fluids. 
SRM  1598  consists  of  two  capped  polypropylene  vials,  each  containing  5  to  6  mL  of  bovine  serum.

The  certified  concentrations  of  the  con- 
stituent  elements  are  shown  in  Table  1.  These  concentrations  are  based  on  the  agreement  of  results  by  at  least 
two  independent  analytical  methods.  Noncertified  concentrations,  which  are  given  for  information  only,  appear 
in  Table  2.  Methods  used  for  the  determination  and  certification  of  the  certified  elements  are  shown  in  Table 3.

Notice  and  Warnings  to  Users: 

irati 

ion;  This  certification  will  be  invalid  after  one  year  from  the  date  of  shipment.  Should  it 
be  invalidated  before  then,  users  will  be  notified  by  National  Institute  of  Standards  &  Technology  (NIST).  Please 
return  the  attached  registration  card  to  facilitate  notification.

storage:  The  material  should  be  stored  in  its  original  containers  at  -20  °C  or  below.  A  "frost-free"  type  freezer 
should  not  be  used.  SRM  1598  should  not  be  exposed  to  intense  sources  of  radiation,  including  ultraviolet  lamps 
or  sunlight.  For  long  term  storage,  we  recommend  sealing  in  a  plastic  bag  containing  ice  cubes  to  maintain  100% 
humidity. 

Use;  The  frozen  serum  should  be  thawed  at  room  temperature  and  mixed  thoroughly  by  inverting  the  vial  scveral 
times  before  use.  Vials  should  be  opened  only  in  a  clean  area  with  precautions  taken  against  contamination  during 
sampling.  We  recommend  weighing  rather  than  pipetting  samples  for  analysis  because  of  the  viscous  nature  of 
the  serum.  The  minimum  recommended  sample  size  is  250  mg  (see  section  on  Homogeneity). 

SRM  1598  IS  INTENDED  FOR  "IN  VITRO"  DIAGNOSTIC  USE  ONLY! 

Coordination  of  the  technical  measurements  by  members  of  NIST  Inorganic  Analytical  Research  Division  was 
performed  by  H.M.  Kingston  of  that  Division;  coordination  of  the  technical  measurements  by  cooperating  analysts 
was  performed  by  C.  Veillon  of  the  U.S.  Department  of  Agriculture,  Beltsville,  MD. 

Statistical  analysis  of  the  experimental  data  was  performed  by  S.B.  Schiller  of  NIST  Statistical  Engineering  Division. 

The  technical  and  support  aspects  involved  in  the  certification  and  issuance  of  this  Standard  Reference  Material 
were  coordinated  through  the  Office  of  Standard  Reference  Materials  by  Robert  Alvarez.

a  Methods  used  for  the  determination  and  certification  of  each  element  are  shown  in  Table  3. 
b  The  certified  concentrations  are  equally  weighted  means  of  results  from  two  or  more  analytical  methods.  To  convert  concentrations  from 
Us/e  or  ng/g,  to  ug/mL  or  ng/mL,  respectively,  multiply  by  the  density  of  the  serum,  1.029  g/mL  at  23  °C. 
c  The  stated  uncertainty  of  the  K  concentration  is  based  on  results  obtained  in  three  laboratories  by  two  different  methods,  neither  of  which  is 
either  the  reference  method  or  the  definitive  method  as  defined  by  the  National  Committee  for  Clinical  Laboratory  Standards.  (See  tabic  3). 
is  certified  with  a  smaller  uncertainty  in  freeze-dried  Human  Serum,  SRM  909,  based  on  the  “definitive  method"  isotope  dilution  mass 
spectrometry. 

K 

The  stated  uncertainty  includes  allowances  for  measurement  imprecision,  material  inhomogeneity,  and  differences 
among  analytical  methods.  Each  uncertainty  is  computed  from  a  95%  prediction  interval  and  an  allowance  for 
systematic  error  among  the  methods  used,  combined  as  the  square  root  of  the  sum  of  their  squares.  In  the  absence 
of  systematic  error,  the  prediction  intervals  used  have  the  following  statistical  property:  95%  is  the  statistical 
expectation  of  the  percentage  of  all  samples  of  this  SRM  having  concentrations  within  the  stated  uncertainty 
limits.

Preparation  of  Material:  The  bovine  serum  was  prepared  under  the  direction  of  C.  Veillon,  Beltsville  Human 
Nutrition  Research  Center,  U.S.  Department  of  Agriculture,  Beltsville,  MD.,  as  described  previously  (1,2). 

In  this  procedure,  blood  was  collected  from  four  unconscious  dairy  cows  under  carefully  controlled  conditions  to 
minimize  contamination.  The  blood  was  centrifuged  and  the  separated  serum  was  combined  in  a  single  container 
and  mixed  continuously  while  aliquoting  into  individual  polypropylene  vials  (5-6  mL/vial).  The  vials  were  capped, 
labeled,  bagged  with  ice  cubes  to  maintain  100%  humidity,  and  stored  at  -20  °C. 
Vials  were  selected  at  random 
for  analysis. 

All  operations,  except  the  initial  collection  and  centrifugation  in  sealed  bottles,  were  carried  out  in  a  Class-100 
area  of  a  clean  room.  Prior  to  filling  with  serum,  the  vials  had  been  soaked  for  two  weeks  in  5%  nitric  acid,

rinsed  with  deionized  water,  and  dried  by  lyophilization  in  a  plastic  chamber  known  to  be  free  of  trace  element 
contamination. 

Homogeneity:  Homogeneity  of  SRM  1598  was  examined  as  part  of  the  analytical  program  for  certification  by

spectrometry,  approximately  200  ug  was  used. 
No  evidence  of  material  inhomogeneity  was  found  for  these 
determinations  or  for  other  elemental  determinations  where  larger  samples  were  used.  A  minimum  sample  size 
of  250  mg  is  recommended.
