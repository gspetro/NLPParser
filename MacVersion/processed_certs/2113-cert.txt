Dynamic Impact Force Verification Specimens 
 
(Self-Verification, 8-mm Striker; 33 kN nominal) 
aal) 
 
Lot No.: LL-103 
 
This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  the  verification  of  the  maximum  force  measured 
dynamically using a Charpy machine equipped with an instrumented 8-mm striker, in accordance with the current ASTM 
Standard E2298 [1] or the current ISO Standard 14556 [2].  A unit of SRM 2113 consists of a set of four specimens 
needed to perform a single verification. SRM 2113 can also be used to verify the absorbed energy scale of the impact 
machine at the low-energy level.  When testing is performed at room temperature, the force and absorbed energy scales 
can be verified simultaneously.  This SRM can also be used to verify the absorbed energy scale at a test temperature of 
–40 °C, but no force information is available at this temperature.  
 
Material Description:   SRM 2113 is made from 4340 alloy steel.  The bars are finished to length, stamped, heat-treated, 
and machined in SRM specimen lots of approximately 1200 to 2000 specimens.  Each specimen has a lot number and 
an identification number (three or four digits). 
 
SRM Certification Procedure:  Specimens taken from each SRM lot were tested by the NIST Applied Chemicals and 
Materials  Division  on  Charpy  reference  machines  for  absorbed  energy,  and  via  an  interlaboratory  comparison 
(round robin) [3] for maximum force.  These data were statistically evaluated to ensure the homogeneity of the lot, establish 
certified value, and determine the number of SRM specimens required for a user to perform a valid verification.  A NIST 
certified value  is  a value  for  which  NIST has  the highest  confidence  in  its  accuracy,  in  that  all known or  suspected 
sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [4].  The measurand is absorbed energy as measured by the 
NIST Charpy reference machines, and maximum force as established from the interlaboratory comparison.  Traceability 
is to the SI units joule (absorbed energy) and kilonewton (force).  The certified values for the SRM 2113 specimens are 
given in Tables 1 and 2. 
 
Expiration of Certification:    The certified values and uncertainties furnished in this certificate are valid indefinitely. 
The indirect verification result for the absorbed energy scale is valid for one year from the  date on  which the SRM was 
tested.    If a user’s machine is moved or undergoes any major repairs or adjustments, the current  verification will be 
invalidated,  and  the  machine  must  be  retested  and  reverified  (see  “Instructions  for  Handling,  Storage,  and  Use”).  
Currently, there are no requirements for the verification of the force scale.  However, it is recommended to verify the 
calibration of the instrumented striker of the small-scale Charpy machine every time the striker undergoes repairs or 
adjustment, or damage is suspected, and every time the impact machine is indirectly verified for absorbed energy. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification.

Overall direction and coordination of the technical measurements leading to verification of test specimens and machines 
are under the direction of the NIST Materials Reliability Division, Boulder, CO. 
 
Support aspects involved in the issuance of this SRM were coordinated through the NIST Office of Reference Materials.

(a) The  uncertainties  in  the  certified  values  provided  are  expanded  uncertainties  about  the  means  to  cover  the  measurands.    The 
expanded  uncertainty  is  calculated  as  U  =  kuc,  where  uc  represents  the  combined  uncertainty  consistent  with  the  ISO/JCGM 
Guide [5].  For room temperature, the coverage factor k = 1.9939 is based on 71 effective degrees of freedom and corresponds to 
an approximate 95 % confidence interval. For –40 °C, the coverage factor k = 1.9944 is based on 70 effective degrees of freedom 
and corresponds to an approximate 95 % confidence interval.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
Handling:  The protective oil coating should be wiped from each specimen with a lint-free cloth just prior to testing. 
 
Storage:  The SRMs are anticipated to have an indefinite shelf life under normal storage conditions (20 °C ± 20 °C, 
≤ 50 % relative humidity). 
 
Use:  Prior to verifying a Charpy machine equipped with an 8-mm striker, the machine should be checked to ensure 
compliance with the appropriate sections of the applicable ASTM or ISO standard.  SRM 2113 is typically tested at room 
temperature (21 °C ± 1 °C) using an instrumented 8-mm striker, so that both the absorbed energy scale and the force 
scale can be verified in accordance with the applicable standard (ASTM or ISO).  However, SRM 2113 can also be 
tested at –40 °C ± 1 °C using an 8-mm striker when no force data is needed.  
 
SRM 2113 can be used to meet the indirect verification requirements of ASTM E23 and ISO 148-2 [6,7].  When using 
SRM 2113, the user performs a self-service verification of the test machine.  The data and specimens are not returned 
to NIST following the test.  NIST provides no letter or certification sticker for the machine tested. 
 
The energy level of the SRM appropriate for verifying the performance of a particular Charpy machine can be determined 
by considering the energy for the SRM, the maximum capacity of the machine, and the requirements of the applicable 
test method (ASTM or ISO). 
 
For questions concerning the production or use of this SRM please contact the NIST Charpy Program Coordinator as 
follows: telephone (303) 497-3351; fax (303) 497-5939; or e-mail charpy@boulder.nist.gov.
