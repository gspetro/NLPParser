Fracture Toughness of Ceramics 
 

This SRM is intended for verification of fracture toughness testing procedures and consists of a set of five hot-pressed 

silicon nitride flexure specimens cut from a single billet (plate) of material.  This SRM may be used with any fracture 

toughness test method, but is optimized for beam bending testing configurations. 
 

The SRM may be used in conjunction with American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) fracture toughness 

standard  C1421-99 (or the Provisional Standard PS070-97 which preceded it) [1].  This SRM may also be used with 

two International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard tests under development by ISO Technical 

Committee TC 206, Fine Ceramics.

Certification:  NIST tested a large number (15 % to 20 % of the total) of specimens taken at random from each 

billet used (see appendix I).  Most of the specimens were tested at NIST by the surface crack in flexure (SCF) and 

precracked beam (PB, also known as single-edged precracked beam (SEPB)) methods in accordance with ASTM 

C1421-99 [1], see Figure 1.  In addition, ten specimens from billet C were also tested by the chevron notch in 

bending (CNB) test configuration A, also in accordance with C1421-99.

  The mean toughness values as measured 

by the three test methods agreed to within 0.4 % to 1.6 %, depending upon the billet, confirming that fracture 

toughness was independent of test method.  Additional details are given in Appendix II. 
 

The average fracture toughness and the scatter in results as measured by the three test methods were statistically 

indistinguishable, and the data, therefore, was pooled.  The certified average fracture toughness in Table 1 is the grand 

average of the pooled NIST data base. 
 

The technical and support aspects involved in the preparation, certification, and issuance of this SRM were coordinated 

through the NIST Standard Reference Materials Program by R.J. Gettings and N.M. Trahey.

 C1421-99 uses a straight through crack assumption (STCA) model for the stress intensity shape factor.  The earlier provisional standard, 

ASTM PS 070-97, had analytical solutions that were based upon a slice model for computing the minimum stress intensity factor coefficient Ymin

 for 

specimen configurations A and D.  It is now believed that the straight-through crack assumption (STCA) model is more accurate (by 5 % to 10 %) for 

these two geometries, and the revised, full consensus ASTM standard C1421-99 includes the new STCA formulation for Ymin

This SRM was prepared and certified by G.D. Quinn of the NIST Ceramics Division, with assistance from K. Xu, and 

R.J. Gettings of the NIST Ceramics Division.  N.F. Zhang of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division assisted with the 

statistical analysis.  J.J. Swab of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory assisted with preliminary experiments.  CNB tests 

were performed by J.A. Salem of NASA-Lewis. 

 

Expiration of Certificate:  The certification of this SRM is valid indefinitely, within the measurement uncertainties 

specified, provided the SRM is used in accordance with the instructions given in this certificate and its appendices.  

However, the certificate will be nullified if the SRM is damaged. 

 

Description of SRM:  The SRM is a set of 5 unprecracked ceramic test specimens of hot-pressed silicon nitride 

(HPSN), Norton Grade NC 132
2
, manufactured by Norton Co., Worcester, MA.  The NC 132 HPSN was originally 

fabricated in the form of a billet of nominal size 158 mm × 158 mm square with a thickness of 20 mm to 30 mm.  The 

specimens were sliced from the billet such that the 3 mm × 4 mm cross section plane (in which cracks will be initiated 

and propagated) is parallel to the hot pressing direction as described in detail in Appendix I.  This 1970-1980’s vintage 

material was hot-pressed with a small amount (about 1 wt %) of magnesium oxide (or a magnesium compound which 

yields MgO when heated) sintering aid and is primarily composed of slightly elongated beta silicon nitride grains.  A 

small amount of amorphous second phase resides in small triple point pockets or as thin layers between the silicon 

nitride grains.  Some small tungsten carbide inclusions are dispersed throughout the material.  This material fractures in 

a mixed transgranular and intergranular mode.  It has a flat R-curve
3
 and is highly resistant to environmentally-assisted 

slow crack growth at room temperature.  Consequently, different test methods produce virtually identical toughness 

results. 

 

Three separate billets, “C”, “G”, and “D”, were designated for use in SRM 2100 and for its lots.  There is a statistically 

significant difference in fracture toughness for specimens from the three billets.  The specimens in this SRM kit are all 

from one billet whose identity is listed in the first column of Table 1 and scribed onto one end face of each specimen.

possible orientations. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Each 3 mm × 4 mm × (45 to 47) mm flexure bar specimen was prepared in accordance with conventional flexure 

strength standards MIL STD 1942(A) 
 
[2], ASTM C 1161 [3],

 
and draft ISO standard 14704 [4], as well as with ASTM 

C1421-99 [1] and two draft ISO standards for fracture toughness testing of ceramics.  In addition, one 4 mm wide face 

has a 900 grit finish which is finer than is normally required and is provided as a convenience to users who wish to

Certain commercial equipment, instruments, or materials are identified in this certificate to specify adequately the experimental 

procedure.  Such identification does not imply recommendation or endorsement by NIST, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment 

identified are necessarily the best available for the purpose.

precrack with a Knoop indenter for the SCF test method.  The edges of the specimens have been chamfered in 

accordance with requirements for the surface crack in flexure (SCF) and single-edged precracked beam (SEPB) test 

methods.  (A small correction factor for the chamfer should be applied to SCF results as described in Appendix III.) 

 

Discussion of Uncertainties:  The uncertainty estimates were made in accordance with NIST policy [5,6] and consisted 

of Type A uncertainties evaluated by statistical means.  NIST tested a large number (15 % to 20 % of the total) of 

specimens taken at random from each billet used.  Most of the specimens were tested to fracture by one of the three 

standard test method procedures: SCF, CNB, or PB (SEPB).  Additional PB (SEPB) experiments were performed on the 

broken halves. 

 

The uncertainty U1 in Table 1 is a 95 % prediction uncertainty for a single future observation, based on the results of the 

NIST independently and randomly selected observations from the same population [7].  The uncertainty, Um, is a 95 % 

prediction uncertainty for the mean of five future observations, also based on the results of the NIST independently and 

randomly selected observations.  The expanded uncertainty is calculated as U = kuc where uc is, at the level of one 

standard deviation, and represents the combined effects of material inhomogeneity and within-laboratory components of 

uncertainty.  U1 is the uncertainty for an individual specimen, and Um is the uncertainty in the mean fracture toughness 

for the five specimens in this kit.  The coverage factor, k, is determined from the Student’s t-distribution corresponding 

to the degrees of freedom appropriate to the number of specimens tested at NIST and at the 95 % confidence level. 

 

Storage and Handling:  The specimens are packaged in conventional ceramic flexure specimen trays.  The specimens 

are durable; no special handling requirements are necessary.  Once precracked, the CNB and SEPB specimens should be 

handled with care to avoid accidental breakage. 

 

Instructions for Use:  This SRM may be used with any fracture toughness test method although the specimens have 

been optimized for flexural modes of loading.  The user must precrack the specimens.  It is strongly recommended that 

the user test these specimens only after they have acquired some familiarity with the test method. 

 

The certified fracture toughness values are valid for cracks propagated in planes that are parallel to the specimen 

3 mm × 4 mm cross section.  Cracks may be initiated or propagated from either the 3 mm wide or the 4 mm wide 

surfaces.  The fracture toughness is not certified for cracks propagated on planes parallel to the specimens’ long axis.  

See Appendix I for further details. 

 

Consult ASTM C1421-99 [1] for specific test method details if the SCF, PB (SEPB), or CNB methods are used. 

 

Test Specimens:  Although the specimens are from a single billet, their dimensions should be measured individually due 

to slight variations in machining.  The specimen chamfers should also be measured if the SCF method is used. 

 

Test Fixtures:  The specimens are suitable for flexural modes of loading with conventional flexure strength 

fixtures.  Common 20 mm × 40 mm (or 10 mm × 20 mm) four-point flexure strength fixtures that are designed to be 

in accordance with the well-known standard flexure strength test standards are satisfactory for all three fracture 

toughness methods. Users are reminded that there are critical requirements for fixture alignment, load pin and 

specimen alignment, fixture articulation, and load pin rolling action to eliminate friction constraints that will bias the 

test result. 

 

Four-point flexural loading is preferred for SCF and CNB testing.  20 mm × 40 mm spans are recommended, but not 

required.  The PB (SEPB) test may be conducted in either three- or four-point loading.  The outer span should be 

between 16 mm and 40 mm.  Three-point loading should be performed with extra caution since it may be difficult to 

align the precrack with the middle roller, especially with short 16 mm to 20 mm spans.
4
  The specimens in the SRM kit 

may be fractured on full-sized 20 mm × 40 mm fixtures.  The halves may then be precracked and retested on shorter 

three- or four-point fixture spans. 

 

                                                           
4
More trials are apt to be unacceptable and rejected due to twisted fracture planes.  There is a growing body of published information that 

suggests that erroneous results (overestimates of 5 % or more of toughness) may be obtained with very short three-point spans.

Testing Rates:  Testing rates between 0.1 MPa�m
½
/s and 2.75 MPa�m

½
/s are specified for normal testing [1].  Fracture 

toughness is independent of test environment (in laboratory air ambient conditions, 20 �C to 25 �C, with relative 

humidities of 20 % to 60 % or in dry-nitrogen gas) when normal testing rates were employed. 

 

SCF Precracking and Testing:  The following information may be helpful if the SCF method is utilized.  SCF 

specimens may be precracked at a 24.5 N (2.5 kgf) or 49.0 N (5 kgf) Knoop indentation load.  The 24.5 N load is 

preferred since the resulting indentation is smaller, and less material needs to be removed by polishing or hand grinding 

after indentation.  Most of the NIST SRM data base was generated with this load, and a VAMAS round robin confirmed 

that this load was eminently suitable.  One 4 mm wide face has been given a finer finish (900 grit) than is customary for 

flexure specimens and is suitable for Knoop indentation.  The Knoop indentation alternatively may be implanted on one 

of the 3 mm wide faces, but these should be fine ground, lapped, or polished to provide a flat, even surface for the 

Knoop indentation.
5
   If an indentation load of 24.5 N is used and the proper amount of material has been removed by 

polishing or hand grinding with abrasives, the precrack size should be approximately 50 µm deep × 150 µm wide.  

Machining the residual stress damage zone off the specimens surface with the use of diamond grinding wheels is 

possible, but not recommended.
6
 

 

Four-point loading is required for the SCF configuration since it is very difficult to align the tiny precrack with the 

middle load roller in three-point loading.   Fracture loads are modest, (typically 400 N to 600 N for 24.5 N precracks in 

20 mm × 40 mm four-point fixtures), so no special handling precautions need be taken.  The flexure strength of the 

flawed specimen, and thus its fracture toughness, should be corrected for the chamfers in SCF tests.  An average chamfer 

size should be measured and used for the correction as described in Appendix III.  Consult ASTM C1421-99 for 

additional details.  Appendix IV has details on the precision error associated with this test method. 

 

CNB Precracking and Testing:  The specimens in this SRM are in accordance with configurations “A” and “D” in 

ASTM C1421-99, which require four-point loading.  Proper chevron notch preparation is critical.  The notch should be 

uniform, the grooves should align very closely, and the back sides of the chevron (dimensions a11 and a12 in 

ASTM C1421-99) must not cut through to the specimen back face.  Causal notching with a diamond cut off wheel is 

usually unsatisfactory.  A precision set up and specimen holder is optimal.   

 

The “A” configuration CNB specimen-fixture combination in ASTM C1421-99 requires four-point flexure testing. 

Fracture loads are small, (typically 20 N to 50 N depending upon loading configuration), so care should be exercised in 

handling and preloading these specimens.  Cracks should pop in or extend stably from the chevron tip during a normal 

fracture toughness test provided that the chevron notch has been prepared properly.  The specimens in this SRM have 

been prepared with edge chamfers which are not required or recommended for CNB testing, but experience has shown 

that the chamfers do not interfere with the results for this SRM.  Consult ASTM C1421-99 for additional details.  

Appendix IV has details on the precision error associated with this test method. 

 

PB (SEPB) Precracking and Testing:  The following information may be helpful if the PB (SEPB) method is utilized.  

Conventional bridge precrackers may be used to pop in a precrack that is between 0.35W and 0.60W deep, where W, 

the specimen thickness, is 4 mm.  A starter flaw is carefully centered in the bridge anvil precracker.  A single 98 N (10 

kgf) Knoop has been found to be satisfactory, provided that the long axis is lined up perpendicularly to the specimen 

long axis.  The indentation may be placed directly into the ground 3 mm wide face.  A finely ground or polished 

surface is unnecessary.  With a 6 mm bridge gap, bridge anvil pop-in loads should be between 8 000 N and 11 000 N.  

One or more aligned Vickers indentations may be used, provided that the indentation load does not exceed 98 N (10 

kgf).  A shallow saw cut may also serve as a starter flaw.  

 

Either three-or four-point loading may be used, but extra precautions are necessary with the former to guarantee that the 

precrack is lined up with the middle roller.  Fracture loads will be small (50 N to 120 N depending upon testing 

configuration and precrack size), so care should be exercised in handling and preloading the specimens.  No correction 

                                                           
5
One method utilized at NIST is to use a motorized hobby drill (e.g. Dremel) with a cloth polishing wheel and diamond paste to 

polish a small spot in the middle of the specimen. 
6
Experiments at NIST confirmed that the identical mean fracture toughness is obtained, but the standard deviation was considerably 

larger.  The SCF precracks were not as regular as those from hand ground or lapped specimens. Apparently the machine grinding altered the 

precracks and possibly propagated portions of the crack front.  It is also difficult to guarantee that each specimen has had the correct amount of 

material removed when using diamond wheel grinding, especially if the specimens are mounted and ground together.  



SRM 2100  Page 5 of 6  

for specimen chamfers should be made.  Consult ASTM C1421-99 for additional details.  Appendix IV has details on 

the precision error associated with this test method. 

 

Other Precracking Testing Methods:  Other test methods may be used with this SRM, but since the specimens are 

optimal for flexure testing, some configurations such as double torsion, double cantilever beam, etc., are not feasible.  

The Vickers indentation crack length method is not recommended due to the lack of a universally accepted equation for 

relating crack length to toughness, the lack of a universally accepted indentation load, and other experimental difficulties 

which have been confirmed by a VAMAS round robin project on similar materials [8].  Crack plane orientation is also 

an issue with this method, since it is known that the fracture toughness is different for cracks extending in the plane 

perpendicular to the hot-pressing direction compared to cracks running parallel to the hot-pressing direction.  Under no 

circumstances should this SRM be used to generate a so-called “universal calibration constant” for the Vickers 

indentation crack length method, since it is impossible for a single constant to apply to a wide range of ceramics. 

 

Repeat Testing:  Broken halves of the specimens may be retested.  PB (SEPB) testing at NIST on two billets 

demonstrated there was no difference in outcomes for full-size specimens tested on 20 mm × 40 mm four point fixtures 

versus outcomes from specimen halves tested on 10 mm × 20 mm spans, or halves tested on three-point fixtures with 20 

mm spans.  The reject rate for the three point configuration was greater, however, due to crack twisting and alignment 

problems.

APPENDIX I 

Specimen and Crack Plane Orientation 

 
All specimens were cut from the hot-pressed silicon nitride plates as illustrated in the Figure below.  Fracture toughness 

was measured and is certified only for crack planes that are parallel to the hot-pressing direction.  Crack propagation 

may be in either the direction parallel to or perpendicular to the hot-pressing direction. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
The small arrows show the direction of crack extension. 

 

Identical results are obtained in SCF experiments with artificial precracks implanted on the narrow 3 mm specimen 

surfaces as compared to specimens with cracks implanted on the 4 mm faces.  In addition, PB (SEPB) and CNB 

experiments wherein the crack extended in the direction as the 4 mm edge produced results identical to the SCF 

experiments wherein the crack started on the 4 mm wide face and propagated into specimens parallel to the 3 mm face. 

 

ASTM C1421-99 recommends that the crack plane and the crack extension direction be defined in relation to the plate.  

The identification scheme is a set of letters first indicating the crack plane, then a second set of letters which designate 

the direction of crack extension in that plane.  The first letter which describes the crack plane is designated by the vector 

that is normal to the crack plane.  By this nomenclature scheme, all crack planes and crack extensions in this SRM are 

“X-HP”, “X-Y”, “Y-HP”, or “Y-X”.  Fracture toughness is not certified for crack planes that are perpendicular to the 

hot-pressing direction (“HP-X” or “HP-Y” fracture systems).  The fracture toughness is smaller for these crack planes.

APPENDIX II 

Additional Background Information 

 

The fracture toughness data for this SRM was generated by the three test methods in the ASTM standard test method [1]. 

 

The SCF method, also known as the “controlled flaw” method, is a development of early work by Petrovic and 

colleagues [9,10].  This innovative method utilizes a Knoop indenter to create a micro, semielliptical surface precrack.  

It is essential that residual stresses from the indentation are eliminated by polishing or hand grinding the indentation 

away after indentation.  The specimen is fractured in a conventional flexural strength test fixture.  Fractographic 

techniques are used to detect and measure the precrack after specimen fracture.  The name of this method has been 

changed to “surface crack in flexure” in order to avoid confusion with other so-called controlled flaw methods and to 

make it consistent with fracture mechanics conventions.  Fracture toughness is computed from the stress (or maximum 

load) at fracture, the crack size, and stress intensity factor solutions.  The latter factor should be individually calculated 

for each specimen precrack.  Additional details are in the literature [11-14]. 

 

The PB (SEPB) method is widely accepted in the fracture mechanics and ceramics community in large part since it is a 

traditional fracture mechanics configuration with a good record for producing accurate and precise results.  A variant on 

the older single-edged notched beam method, the SEPB method uses an innovative precracking procedure (compression 

bridge-anvil loading) to produce a sharp precrack [15].  A saw cut or indentation is placed in the narrow side of a flexure 

specimen.  The specimens are placed into a compression-anvil precracking apparatus and loaded carefully until a 

precrack pops in.  The specimen is fractured in a flexure fixture.  Crack size is measured on the fracture surface.  

Fracture toughness is computed on the basis of the specimen and fixture dimensions, the load at fracture, and stress 

intensity factor formulations. 

 

The CNB test entails loading a chevron-notched specimen to fracture in a flexure fixture.  The crack initiates at the 

chevron tip and then propagates stabily through the chevron.  Since generalized stress intensity factor solutions do not 

exist for CNB testing, it is necessary to specify very specific specimen and notch configurations.  The 3 mm × 4 mm 

cross section sized specimens in this SRM are suitable for use as either configuration A or D in ASTM C1421-99.  

Stringent requirements are placed upon the specimen preparation since successful outcomes, which rely upon stable 

crack extension, depend upon having well-machined notches [16].  Stress intensity factor coefficients are very sensitive 

to the precise chevron geometries.  Analytical errors of 10 % or more are possible if formulas for idealized chevron 

geometries are applied to casually-fabricated specimens.  It is especially important that:  the two notch grooves (one on 

either side of the specimen) meet very closely without an offset, the notch tip be well centered, the sides of the chevron 

be very symmetric about the specimen centerline, and the sides of the chevron should end on the specimen side and not 

break through to the back surface.  Proper specimen preparation requires careful machining by an experienced 

laboratory or machine shop, but experience shows this can be quite routine.  Casual notch preparation by a student with 

a cut off wheel in a laboratory will not suffice.  Misalignments in the chevron will promote unstable crack propagation 

that will invalidate the test.  Experienced machine shops usually have a custom specimen holder to position the specimen 

while the chevron is cut from one side.  The specimen or holder is flipped and the chevron completed by cutting from 

the opposite side.  The specimen is tested in conventional flexure fixtures and the crack must be propagated stability.  

Fracture toughness is computed from the maximum load during stable crack extension, the specimen and fixture 

dimensions, stress intensity factor coefficient solutions, and the precise chevron geometry for each specimen. 

 

A Versailles Advanced Materials and Standards (VAMAS) round robin which featured the SCF test method on NC 132 

hot-pressed silicon nitride obtained extraordinarily consistent results from 20 laboratories around the world.  Fracture 

toughness results for NC 132 in the literature from many sources, by many different test methods for over 20 years have 

been unusually consistent.  The crack planes were parallel to the hot-pressing direction in most of these studies.  In 

particular, results by the chevron notch in bending, short bar chevron notch, surface crack in flexure, and single-edged 

precracked beam tests converged in the range of 4.5 MPa�m

The fracture toughness of SCF specimens should be corrected for the corner chamfers.  The correction increases the 

calculated SCF fracture toughness outcomes slightly (usually 0.4 % to 0.9 %).  The NIST SCF fracture toughness data 

used to prepare the certified value for this SRM was corrected.  Do not correct PB (SEPB) or CNB test results for corner 

chamfers. 

 

The chamfers in the SRM specimens are typically 0.10 mm to 0.15 mm in size, although some may be larger.  The 

chamfer size, c, may be measured with a microscope having a traveling stage or from photographic analysis.  All eight c 

dimensions for the four chamfers should be measured and an average value used for the correction. 

 

The fracture toughness in SCF specimens may be calculated from the formula: 
1/2

fIc aσYK =  
 

where Y is the appropriate stress intensity shape factor (maximum), σf is the maximum flexure stress in the specimen at 

fracture, and a is the crack depth.  See ASTM C1421-99 or the draft ISO Technical Committee SCF standard for more 

details on the calculation of KIc by this method. 

 

The maximum flexure stress may be calculated from simple beam theory, and it is common to assume that the cross 

section is a simple rectangle.  The chamfers alter this geometry, however, and the second moment of inertia of the 

specimen cross section about the neutral axis is altered [17].  The true maximum flexure stress at fracture is calculated as 

follows: 

σf  =  F σb 
 

where σb is the apparent flexure stress for a simple rectangular beam, computed from simple beam theory, and F is a 

correction factor.  Correction factors are listed in the following tables and are practically identical for the two specimen 

orientations. 

 

Fracture toughness then may be calculated:

APPENDIX  IV 

Test Method Uncertainties and VAMAS Round Robins 
 

The precision uncertainty for a measured value of fracture toughness depends upon the test method. The following 

information was not used in the preparation of the uncertainty statement for this SRM, but is included for the user’s 

benefit to help the user appreciate the common sources of uncertainty. 
 

SCF METHOD 

Uncertainty of Individual Test Results by the SCF Method:  In ASTM C1421-99, for the SCF test method, the type B 

uncertainties of the stress at fracture are estimated to be a maximum of 2 % to 3 %, the crack size measurement, 5 %, 

and the stress intensity factor coefficient, 3 % to 5 %. The latter two uncertainties are coupled, and it is estimated 

that this total uncertainty for fracture toughness is within 5 % [11,12]. 
 

A Versailles Advanced Materials and Standards (VAMAS) interlaboratory round robin [11-13] with 20 laboratories 

confirmed the practicality of the SCF test method and obtained estimates of the within-laboratory (repeatability) and 

between-laboratory (reproducibility) precision uncertainties.  The type A estimates for repeatability and reproducibility 

are shown in Table 1.  These results were obtained on the same material as used for this SRM (but from a different 

billet, designated “E”).  These uncertainties are for an individual test specimen and include both the test method 

uncertainty and variability in the fracture toughness from specimen to specimen.  See References [11-14] for further 

details.

PB (SEPB) METHOD 

Uncertainty of Individual Test Results by the SEPB Method:  In ASTM C1421-99, the type B accuracy of the stress 

intensity factor coefficient for the SEPB test method is estimated to be a maximum of 2 %.  No estimate was made 

for the total uncertainty. 
 

ASTM C1421-99 cites results from a 16 laboratory international VAMAS round robin for a SEPB test procedure 

(similar to but not identical to that in C1421-99) on a gas pressure sintered silicon nitride. 
 

CNB METHOD 

Uncertainty of Individual Results by the CNB Method:  In ASTM C1421-99, it is estimated that the type B accuracy of 

the stress intensity factor coefficient, Ymin
*
, for the CNB test method is a maximum of 2 %.  

 

No CNB round robin data are available at this time.
