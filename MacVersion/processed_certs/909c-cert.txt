Certificate of Analysis 
Standard Reference Material® 909c 

 

 
Frozen Human Serum 

 
This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  use  in  validating  analytical  methods  for  the 
determination  of  specified  constituents  in  human  serum.   This  SRM  can  also  be  used  for  quality  assurance  when 
assigning values to in-house control materials.  A unit of SRM 909c consists of three vials, each containing 2 mL of 
frozen human serum. 
 
Certified Concentration Values:  Certified concentration values for selected constituents are provided in Table 1.  A 
NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that all known or suspected 
sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [1].  The certified concentrations were determined using 
higher-order  reference  measurement  procedures [2]  calibrated  with  NIST  high-purity  neat  or  primary  standard 
solution SRMs; the uncertainties are expanded uncertainties at the 95 % level of confidence [3].  The measurands are 
the constituents listed in Table 1 in human serum.  The certified values are metrologically traceable to SI units for 
amount  of  substance  and  mass,  expressed  both  in  mass  concentrations  (milligrams  per  deciliter,  micrograms  per 
deciliter, nanograms per milliliter, or grams per liter) and amount concentration (nanomoles per liter or micromoles 
per liter). 
 
Reference Concentration Values:  Reference concentration values for total protein and transferrin glycoforms are 
provided in Table 2.  A NIST reference value is a noncertified value that does not meet NIST criteria for certification 
and is provided with associated uncertainties that may reflect only measurement precision, may not include all sources 
of uncertainty [1], or may reflect a lack of sufficient statistical agreement among multiple methods.  The measurands 
are the constituents listed in Table 2 in human serum.  The reference value for total protein is metrologically traceable 
to SI unit for mass, expressed in mass concentration (grams per liter) as realized by the method used.  The reference 
values for transferrin glycoforms are metrologically traceable to SI unit for mass, expressed as mass fraction in percent, 
as realized by the methods used. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 909c is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until  15 October 2025, provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  given  in  this 
certificate (see “Instructions for Storage, Handling, and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, 
contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification.

SRM 909c 

NOTICE AND WARNING TO USERS 
 
SRM 909c  IS  INTENDED  FOR  LABORATORY  USE  ONLY.    THIS  IS  A  HUMAN  SOURCE  MATERIAL.  
HANDLE  PRODUCT  AS  A  BIOHAZARDOUS  MATERIAL  CAPABLE  OF  TRANSMITTING  INFECTIOUS 
DISEASE.  The supplier has reported that each donor unit of plasma used in the preparation of this product was tested 
by FDA-licensed tests and found to be negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), HIV-1 antigen, hepatitis B 
surface antigen, and hepatitis C.  However, no known test method can offer complete assurance that hepatitis B virus, 
hepatitis C virus, HIV, or other infectious agents are absent from this material.  Accordingly, this human blood-based 
product should be handled at the Biosafety Level 2 or higher as recommended for any POTENTIALLY INFECTIOUS 
HUMAN SERUM OR BLOOD SPECIMEN in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/National Institutes of 
Health (NIH) Manual [4]. 
 
STORAGE,
INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE, HANDLING, AND USE 
 
Storage:  The SRM should be stored at –60 °C or lower in the original unopened vials. 
 
Handling and Use:  SRM 909c is provided as frozen serum that should be allowed to thaw at room temperature for 
at least 30 min under subdued light.  After the material is thawed, it should be used immediately.  The contents of the 
vial should then be gently mixed prior to removal of a test portion for analysis.  Precautions should be taken to avoid 
exposure to strong UV light and direct sunlight. 
 
SOURCE, PREPARATION, AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Source and Preparation:  SRM 909c was prepared from “off-the-shelf” plasma that was then converted to serum 
by Aalto Scientific, Ltd. (Carlsbad, CA).  There were no age or gender requirements for donors. 
 
Analytical Approach for Determination of Cholesterol and Total Glycerides:  Cholesterol was determined using 
the  NIST  isotope  dilution  gas  chromatography – mass  spectrometry (ID GC-MS)  reference  method [5,6].    This 
method  is  an  approved  higher-order  reference  measurement  procedure  according  to  the  Joint  Committee  for 
Traceability  in  Laboratory  Medicine (JCTLM) [7].  This  procedure  employs  hydrolysis  of  cholesterol  esters  using 
potassium  hydroxide  in  ethanol,  followed  by  extraction  with  hexane,  and  derivatization  of  cholesterol  using 
bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide [6].  Cholesterol-25,26,27-13C3 was used as the internal standard.  Total glyceride mass 
fractions were determined using the NIST ID GC-MS reference method described in reference [8] and approved by 
the  JCTLM  as  a  higher-order  reference  method.    The  method  involves  hydrolysis  of  triglycerides,  deionization, 
reaction with butylboronic acid in pyridine, and derivatization  with N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide.  
Tripalmitin-1,2,3-13C3 was used as the internal standard. 
 
Analytical Approach for Determination of Creatinine:  Creatinine was determined using an isotope dilution liquid 
chromatography  –  mass  spectrometry (ID LC-MS) method [9]  that  is  similar  to  a  method [10]  developed  at  the 
Laboratory  of  the  Government  Chemist (LGC)  and  is  approved  by  the  JCTLM  as  a  higher-order  reference 
measurement procedure. 
 
Analytical Approach for Determination of Electrolytes:  Chloride was determined using a NIST micro-coulometric 
titration method in which the chloride was reacted quantitatively with Ag+ ion that was coulometrically generated at a 
silver  anode.    The  data  were  corrected  for  the  presence  of  other  electro-active  interferents,  including  bromide.  
Calcium,  magnesium,  and  potassium  were  determined  using  an  isotope  dilution  sector  field  inductively  coupled 
plasma-mass spectrometry (ID ICP-MS) primary method involving spiking with stable isotopes of 42Ca, 41K and 26Mg 
followed by oxidative equilibration using microwave dissolution [11].  Value assignment for sodium was based on 
the combined results from two analytical methods.  The first consisted of an ion exchange gravimetric method [12] 
involving microwave digestion of the SRM 909c serum, followed by separation of the sodium fraction on a cation 
exchange  column  and  addition  of  high-purity  sulfuric  acid  to  form  Na2SO4.    The  amount  of  Na2SO4  was  then 
gravimetrically determined after evaporation to dryness in a platinum crucible.  A second method using inductively 
coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) was also used which consisted of microwave digestion of 
the serum with nitric acid.  Manganese was used as an internal standard. 
 
 

                                                           

(1)  Certain  commercial  instruments,  materials,  or  processes  are  identified  in  this  report  to  adequately  specify  the 
experimental procedure.  Such identification does not imply recommendation or endorsement by the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology, nor does it imply that the instruments, materials, or processes identified are necessarily the best available for the 
purpose.

Analytical Approach for Determination of Iron:  Total iron was determined by isotope dilution inductively coupled 
plasma - mass spectrometry (ID ICP-MS).  The method involved spiking the serum samples with  57Fe, microwave 
digestion, and dilution with water. 
 
Analytical  Approach  for  Determination  of  Selenium:    Total  selenium  was  determined  by  isotope  dilution 
inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry (ID ICP-MS).  The method involved spiking the serum samples with 
77Se, microwave digestion, and dilution with butanol in water. 
 
Analytical  Approach  for  Determination  of  Transferrin  and  Transferrin  Glycoforms:    Total  transferrin  and 
transferrin 
plasma - mass 
isotope 
spectrometry (ID ICP-MS) [13].  The method involved saturation of the serum transferrin with iron and separation of 
individual transferrin glycoforms by SCX chromatography.  Quantitation was based upon ID by either introducing a 
57Fe spike post column or directly spiking the serum samples with an in-house prepared transferrin spike in which 57Fe 
had  been  bound  to  the  protein.    Transferrin  glycoforms  were  determined  by  the  mass  fraction  of  each  individual 
glycoform expressed as a percentage of the total transferrin. 
 
Analytical Approach for Determination of Urea and Uric Acid:  Urea was determined using a modification of the 
ID GC-MS  method  described  in  reference [14],  approved  by  the  JCTLM,  in  which  the  serum  was  spiked  with 
urea-18O, passed through a solid-phase extraction cartridge, concentrated, then derivatized to 6-methyluracil overnight.  
Uric acid was determined using a modification of the ID GC-MS method described in reference [15], approved by 
JCTLM  as  a  higher-order  reference  method.    Serum  samples  were  spiked  with  uric  acid-15N2,  mixed  with 
0.001 mol/L ammonium  hydroxide,  passed  through  a  strong  anion  exchange  resin,  eluted  from  the  column  with 
1 mol/L acetic acid, freeze-dried, and derivatized with N-(t-butyldimethylsilyl)-N-methyltrifluoroacetamide. 
 
Analytical  Approach  for  Determination  of  Total  Protein:    Total  protein  was  determined  using  the 
JCTLM-approved reference method for total serum protein [16].  The measurements were calibrated using SRM 927d 
Bovine Serum Albumin (7 % Solution) as the reference standard. 
 
Homogeneity Assessment:  The homogeneity of all analytes was assessed at NIST using the methods and test portion 
sizes described above; analysis of variance did not show statistically significant heterogeneity. 
 
Value Assignment:  Each certified or reference value is the weighted mean of measurement means from each method 
used.  The measured serum density is 1.024 12 g/mL with a standard deviation of 0.000 09 g/mL; this uncertainty was 
incorporated in values that are reported relative to units of volume.

(a)  Each  certified  concentration  value  is  the  mean  or  combination  of  means  of  results  provided  by  ID LC-MS,  ID GC-MS, 
ID ICP-MS,  ICP-OES,  micro-coulometry  and  ion  exchange-gravimetry.    The  uncertainty  provided  with  each  value  is  an 
expanded  uncertainty  about  the  mean  to  cover  the  measurand  with  approximately  95 % confidence,  consistent  with  the 
ISO/JCGM Guide [3].  The expanded uncertainty is calculated as U = kuc, where uc is the combined uncertainty that incorporates 
within-method uncertainty and Type B uncertainty components related to the analysis, and k is the coverage factor corresponding 
to approximately 95 % confidence for each analyte [3].  For estimates based on multiple methods, the combined uncertainty also 
incorporates between-methods uncertainty [17,18].
