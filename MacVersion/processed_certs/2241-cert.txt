uncertainty 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is a certified spectroscopic standard for the correction of the relative intensity 
of Raman spectra obtained with instruments employing 785 nm laser excitation.  A unit of SRM 2241 consists of an 
optical glass that emits a broadband luminescence spectrum when excited at this laser wavelength.  The measurements 
of the relative spectral intensity are traceable to a lamp-illuminated integrating sphere source which has been calibrated 
for  its  spectral  radiance  at  NIST.    The  shape  of  the  mean  luminescence  spectrum  of  this  glass  is  described  by  a 
mathematical expression that relates the relative spectral intensity to the wavenumber (cm-1) expressed as the Raman 
shift from the excitation laser wavelength.  This model, together with a measurement of the luminescence spectrum 
of  the  standard,  can  be  used  to  determine  the  spectral  intensity-response  correction  that  is  unique  to  each  Raman 
system.  The resulting instrument-intensity-response correction may then be used to obtain Raman spectra that are 
largely free from instrument-induced spectral artifacts. 
 
Certified  Values:    The  polynomials  describing  the  relative  luminescence  spectrum  of  SRM  2241  and  associated 
confidence curves are given in Table 1.  The measurand is relative luminescence measured as a function of Raman 
shift (cm‐1) from the laser excitation wavelength of 785 nm.  Metrological traceability is to the NIST spectral radiance 
scale.  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that all known 
or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [1]. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 2241 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
this 
until 30 November 2020, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given in this 
Use 
certificate (see “Instructions for Handling, Storage, and Use).”  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, 
contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification.

SRM 2241 

Certified Values:  The certified values of the coefficients of the model describing the mean shape of the luminescence 
spectrum of SRM 2241, excited at 785 nm, are listed in Table 1.  The spectrum and its associated expanded uncertainty 
[± 95% confidence curves (CC)] are shown in Figure 1 [2,3].  This  model is certified to describe the luminescent 
response of the SRM when it is measured in the temperature range of 20 °C to 25 °C.  This model certifies the shape 
of the luminescence spectrum between 200 cm–1 and 3500 cm–1 Raman shift for excitation with a 785 nm laser. 
 
Certification Uncertainty:  The coefficients of the models that express the expanded uncertainty (± 95 % confidence 
curves) of the certified model of ISRM(∆υ) are listed in Table 1.  These models are used to calculate the upper and 
lower 95 % confidence curves for the mean luminescence spectrum of SRM 2241.  These upper and lower bounds are 
shown in Figure 1.   
 
The confidence curves were calculated by applying the point-by-point uncertainty analysis of [2,3] to the data from 
which the certified model was derived.  The curves represent the uncertainties on the mean luminescence spectrum of 
SRM 2241 based on measurements using three different spectrometers.  Components of the uncertainty include the 
uncertainty  in  the  calibration  source  and  various  estimable  systematic  errors  from  the  operation  of  the  Raman 
instruments used in the measurements.  Careful measurements of the glass have shown it to be spatially homogeneous 
in spectral luminescence.  No significant changes in the shape of the luminescence spectrum occur over the range of 
laser power densities commonly used in Raman instruments.

SRM 2241

Physical Description:  SRM 2241 is a chromium-doped (mole fraction of 0.02 % Cr2O3) sodium borosilicate matrix 
glass.    Each  unit  of  this  SRM  consists  of  a  glass  slide  that  is  approximately  10  mm  in  width  ×  10  mm  in 
length × 1.65 mm in thickness, with one surface optically polished and the opposite surface ground to a frosted finish 
using a 400 grit polish.  Two mounts are furnished  with the slide.  One is a 12.5 mm square cuvette-style optical 
mount.  This mount is designed for the typical 12.5 mm sampling accessories widely used in chemical spectroscopy, 
i.e., absorbance, fluorescence, etc.  The glass slide is retained, frosted side out, in a slot on the front face of the holder.  
Two plastic springs, also retained in the slot, hold the glass slide in place while allowing for positioning within the 
slot to accommodate different beam heights.  Grooves on the sides of the slot require that the glass slide and springs 
be loaded into the slot from the bottom of the holder.  The other mount is a 2.5 cm × 7.6 cm × 0.3 cm microscope 
slide-style holder.  On the top face is a rectangular slot to retain the glass slide over a circular aperture in the center of 
the holder.  Two plastic springs serve to hold the glass slide in the slot centered over the circular aperture.  Removal 
of the SRM glass for measurements that are physically hindered by the holders do not alter the certified properties of 
this SRM.  
 
Measurement Conditions:  The certification measurements of the luminescence spectrum of SRM 2241 were made 
using  three  spectrometer  systems:    one  commercial  Raman  microscopy  system  operated  in  a  180°  backscatter 
geometry, one Raman system based on 460 mm focal length spectrograph designed for array detectors operated in a 
180°  backscatter  geometry,  and  one  commercial  near-IR  spectrofluorometer  operated  in  a  90°  geometry  [6].  
Excitation laser wavelength was measured daily using a wavemeter.  Excitation laser sources included an argon ion 
laser pumped titanium:sapphire solid-state tunable laser (785.00 nm ± 0.01 nm) and a frequency-stabilized 785 nm 
diode laser source (784.98 nm ± 0.02 nm).  Either edge or notch Rayleigh rejection filters were used on all systems.  
The  absolute  wavenumber  or  wavelength  axis  of  each  spectrometer  was  calibrated  using  emission  lines  from 
low-pressure pen lamps operated with a DC power supply.  The y-axis (relative spectral intensity) of each system was 
calibrated with a white-light, uniform-source, integrating sphere that had been calibrated for irradiance at NIST or by 
a high-emissivity blackbody radiator with furnace temperature calibrated by the manufacturer.  All certification data 
were acquired at nominal room temperature (22 °C). 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE  
 
Handling and Storage:  The glass slide should be handled only in its mount.  Although not recommended, the glass 
standard may be removed from its mount without altering the certified properties of the glass.  When not in use, the 
SRM should be stored in the container provided or in one providing comparable mechanical protection. 
 
Use:  SRM 2241 is used to provide Raman spectra corrected for relative intensity and is not intended for use as a 
standard  for  the  determination  of  absolute  spectral  irradiance  or  radiance.    This  requires  a  measurement  of  its 
luminescence  spectrum  on  the  Raman  instrument  and  then  a  mathematical  treatment  of  both  this  observed 
luminescence  spectrum,  and  the  observed  Raman  spectrum  of  the  sample.    This  SRM  is  intended  for  use  in 
measurements over the temperature range of 20 °C to 25 °C.  It may also be used for Raman excitation with lasers 
that  range  from  784  nm  to  786  nm  in  excitation  wavelength.    Use  of  this  SRM  at  temperatures  outside  of  the 
certification temperature range is not currently supported. 
 
For proper use of this procedure, attention must be paid to the following experimental conditions.  The spectrometer 
laser and x-axis should be calibrated using the manufacturer’s recommended methods.  Validation of the Raman shift 
axis may be accomplished by referring to ASTM E1840-96 [7].  It is important that the laser excitation be incident 
only on the frosted surface of the glass.  The shape of the spectral luminescence will have some sensitivity to the 
placement of the glass surface relative to the collection optics of the spectrometer, which is minimized by scattering 
from  the  frosted  surface.    Measurement  conditions  should  be  arranged  to  furnish  a  spectrum  of  optimum 
signal-to-noise ratio of the SRM.  The luminescence spectrum must be acquired over the same Raman range as that 
of the sample.

The relative intensity of the measured Raman spectrum of the sample can be corrected for the instrument-specific 
response by a computational procedure that uses a correction curve.  This curve is generated using the certified model 
and the measured luminescence spectrum of the SRM glass.  For the spectral range of certification, ∆υ = 200 cm-1 to 
3500 cm-1, compute the elements of the certified relative mean spectral intensity of SRM 2241, ISRM(∆υ), according 
to equation (1)  
 

ISRM(∆υ)  =  A0  +  A1  ×  (∆υ)1  +  A2  ×  (∆υ)2  +  A3  ×  (∆υ)3  +  A4  ×  (∆υ)4  +  A5  ×  (∆υ)5 

(1) 

 
where (∆υ) is the wavenumber in units of Raman shift (cm–1) and the An’s are the coefficients listed in Table 1.  The 
‘he
elements of ISRM(∆υ) are obtained by evaluating equation (1) at the same data point spacing used for the acquisition 
of the luminescence spectrum of the SRM and of the Raman spectrum of the sample.  ISRM(∆υ) has been normalized 
to unity and is a relative unit expressed in terms of photons   s–1   cm–2   (cm–1)–1.  The data sets that are the measured 
glass luminescence spectrum, SSRM, and the measured Raman spectrum of the sample, SMEAS, must have the units of 
Raman  shift  (cm–1).    The  elements  of  the  correction  curve  ICORR(∆υ),  defined  by  equation  (2),  are  obtained  from 
ISRM(∆υ) and the elements of the glass luminescence spectrum, SSRM(∆υ), by 

Table 

ICORR(∆υ)  =  ISRM(∆υ) / SSRM(∆υ). 

The elements of the intensity-corrected Raman spectrum, SCORR(∆υ), are derived by multiplication of the elements of 
the measured Raman spectrum of the sample, SMEAS(∆υ), by the elements of the correction curve [8] 
 

SCORR(∆υ)  =  SMEAS(∆υ)  ×  ICORR(∆υ). 

 
The  certified  model,  equation  (1),  is  certified  for  use  between  200  cm–1  and  3500  cm–1.    The  certified  model  is 
intended as a simple numerical descriptor of the spectral response observed over the wavenumber range studied.  It is 
not  intended  as  a  physically  meaningful  model.    The  model  coefficients  listed  in  Table  1  cannot  be  used  to 
extrapolate the limits of certification without incurring significant error.  Extrapolation of the model outside 
the certification limits of 200 cm –1 and 3500 cm–1 is not a supported use of this SRM.   
 
Luminescence Spectrum on the Wavelength Scale:  The equation describing the mean luminescence spectrum of 
the glass SRM is given in equation (1), where (∆υ) is the wavenumber in units of Raman shift (cm–1).  For correction 
of spectra where the x-axis is in wavelength with units of nanometers, the same model coefficients can be used to 
calculate ISRM(λ) through the following coordinate transformation: 
 

ISRM(λ)  =  [107/λ2]  ×  [A0  +  A1  ×  Z1  +  A2  ×  Z2  +  A3  ×  Z3  +  A4  ×  Z4  +  A5  ×  Z5] 

 
where 

Z  =  107  ×  [(1.0/λL)  –  (1.0/λ)] 

  
and λL is the wavelength of the laser in nanometers and λ is the wavelength in nanometers.  The prefactor of 107 in the 
first term of equation (4) is needed only if it is desired to preserve the numerical value of spectral areas computed 
relative to the two x-axis coordinate systems.
