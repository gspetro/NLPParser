Standard Reference Material® 2553



Optical Fiber Coating Diameter



(Nominal Refractive Index 1.504)



Serial Number:  SAMPLE



This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended primarily for use in calibrating instruments which measure the diameter of coated optical fibers.  The index of refraction of the glass rod, 1.504, was chosen to match that of certain fiber coatings.  A unit is individually certified for index of refraction and diameter [1] and consists of an uncoated glass rod approximately 100 mm long and 250 m in diameter.  



Description of SRM:  The SRM is a glass rod that has been specially selected to minimize fluctuations of diameter, taper, and roundness over its certified region.  Each rod has been measured at various positions along and around the certified region, and the average diameter is reported from these measurements.  In addition, the average diameter at specific angular positions along the certified region of the rod is also reported.  The rod is marked with a flag to assist in proper orientation during measurement (see Figure 1).  The flag also serves as the orientation reference for additional certified measurements at the angular positions indicated below.  The average diameter of the rod has been measured and certified inside a zone located 5.0 mm to 7.0 mm from the end opposite the flag.  In addition, the diameter at specific 45° increments is also reported.



Certified Values:  Certified values for the average diameter and diameter at certified regions for the specified Index of Refraction are listed below.  A NISTcertified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy, in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [2].  A certified value is the present best estimate of the true value based on the results of analyses performed at NIST.  The measurand is the diameter of a glass rod of the specified index of refraction, at the oriented measurement positions listed below.  The certified diameter values are metrologically traceable to the defined SI units of length, expressed in millimeters.

Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 2553 is valid indefinitely, within the measurement uncertainties specified, provided that the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given in this certificate (see “Instructions for Handling, Storage, and Use”).  Accordingly, periodic recalibration or recertification of this SRM is not required.  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, or otherwise modified.  



Overall technical direction, measurement process development and analysis, and physical measurements leading to certification were provided by J.R. Stoup and T.D. Doiron of the NIST Semiconductor & Dimensional Metrology Division and M. Young of the NIST Optoelectronics Division.

	Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this material over the period of its certification.  If substantive technical changes occur that affect the certification, NIST will notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification.  If wear is suspected, the SRM may be verified by contacting the technical division personnel at (301) 975-3471 or by fax at (301) 975-5360.



A. Thénot of the NIST Optoelectronics Division assisted with the index of refraction measurements.



The glass rods were supplied by J. O’Connell, L. Moore, and D. Williams of Corning, Inc., Corning, NY().



Support aspects involved in the issuance of this SRM were coordinated through the NIST Office of Reference Materials.



INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE AND USE



Handling:  Routine cleaning of the rod is not recommended.  However, if the rod becomes contaminated, dip the rod into clean, reagent grade isopropyl alcohol.  Less than pure solvents will deposit contaminants onto the glass rod surface.  Be careful not to bump the rod against the walls of the solvent container as the rod can be easily damaged or broken.  Allow the rod to air dry in a clean environment.



Storage:  When not in use, the rod should be stored in the plastic vial supplied or some container with equal or better protection.  Perform work in a clean environment.  Do not handle or expose the rod more than necessary.



Use:  The rod can be used anywhere inside of the certified area.  If the average diameter value is used, the rod should be measured at random angular positions and rotated to properly sample the angular variations in diameter.  If the diameter at a specific angular position is used, the rod should be repositioned longitudinally between measurements to properly sample the variations in diameter (taper).  Extreme care should be used when manipulating the rod.  The rod is brittle and can be very easily damaged or broken, voiding the certification.



Determination of Rod Diameter:  The diameter of each SRM 2553 unit has been measured using a contact micrometer combined with a laser displacement interferometer. These measurements were performed at various applied forces to determine the undeformed diameter by projecting the results to a zero applied force condition.  Measurements were performed within the zones indicated in Figure 1.  For the measurements at specific angular positions, the measurement plane was perpendicular to the 0° position of the flag.  This axis remained fixed while the rod was rotated to the positions shown in Figure 1.

	Figure 1. Measurement Positions and Orientation



The absolute diameter measurements were performed with the flag in the 0° position.  Between five and eight measurements were made at this position within the 2.0 mm certification zone of the rod.  Differential measurements were then performed at 45° intervals around the rod.  Eight measurements were made at each angular position reported in this certificate.  These differential measurements are related to the absolute measurements through the data collected at the 0° angular position.



The average diameter value is the arithmetic average of all 32 measurements of the rod.






Discussion of Uncertainties:  The uncertainty assigned to the diameter values for this SRM unit was calculated according to procedures outlined in reference 2.  Measured (Type A) uncertainties were assumed to be normally distributed.  Estimated (Type B) uncertainties were assumed to be described by a rectangular probability distribution function.  These uncertainties were combined by adding their variances, where the variance of a rectangular distribution is one-third the square of its half-width.  Table 1 lists all identifiable sources of uncertainty.  The uncertainty values assigned to the rod geometry terms in Table 1 are for a single measurement of the rod.
