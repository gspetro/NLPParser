Certificate 
Standard Reference Material® 1003c 
Glass Beads  Particle Size Distribution 

 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended for use in the evaluation and calibration of equipment used to 
measure particle size distributions (PSD) in the 20 µm to 50 µm diameter range.  Typical instrumentation for PSD 
determination  would  be  laser  light  scattering (LLS),  sedimentation,  electrical  sensing  zone (ESZ)  instruments,  and 
wire-cloth test sieves in the range from No. 400 (38 µm) through No. 635 (20 µm).  This size range follows that of the 
coarser beads of SRM 1004b. The SRM consists of a single bottle containing approximately 28 g of solid spherical 
soda-lime glass beads. 
 
Certified Values:  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that all 
known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [1].  The certified cumulative volume 
(mass)  distribution  was  determined  using  both  ESZ  and  LLS  techniques.    The  certified  values  and  associated 
uncertainties based on the average of results from the two techniques are given in Table 1 [2].  A comparison of the ESZ 
and LLS techniques is shown in Figure 1.  
 
Certification Procedure:  Two splits from each of ten bottles were analyzed with both the ESZ and LLS techniques to 
measure the diameter at which a specified percentage of the material is smaller.  The percentages are 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 
30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, and 95.  For each percentage, the only experimental setting that changes 
between the observations is the bottle of material. 
 
Reference Values:  The reference values based on SEM are provided in Table 2 [2].  A NIST reference value is a non-
certified value that is the best estimate of the true value; however, the value does not meet NIST criteria for certification 
and is provided with an associated uncertainty that may reflect only measurement precision and may not include all 
sources of uncertainty [2].  SRM 1003c was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to provide supplementary 
data. 
 
Information Values:  Information values are provided based on ESZ in Table 3, LLS in Table 4, and on sieve analysis 
in Table 5 [1].  A comparison of nominal and effective sieve openings is provided in Table 6.  A NIST information value 
is a value that may be of interest to the SRM user, but insufficient information is available to assess the uncertainty 
associated with the value, therefore no uncertainty is provided [1]. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 1003c is valid indefinitely, within the measurement uncertainty 
specified, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given in this certificate (see 
“Instructions for Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, or otherwise modified.  It is 
expected that some spheres will be lost with each use.  If the unit's loss exceeds 2 % of the original mass, or if spillage or 
contamination occurs, the certification will be nullified and use of the SRM should be discontinued. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
The SRM preparation, measurement, and certification were performed by J.F. Kelly of the NIST Ceramics Division. 
 
Statistical analyses were performed A.I. Avilés of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division. 
 
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Measurement  Services 
Division.

Electrical Sensing Zone  
 
The ESZ technique for determining powder size distribution uses particles suspended in a conductive fluid such as saline 
solution.  The suspension is drawn through an orifice or aperture separating two electrodes between which an electric 
potential is applied.  A particle passing through the orifice (sensing zone) causes a pulse in the circuit impedance, which 
is proportional to the particle volume.  The measured impedance change is converted to a particle volume using a 
calibration constant obtained by measuring particles of known volume.  For a given aperture of diameter (D), the working 
range is from 0.02D to 0.60D.  For SRM 1003c, an instrument with a 100 µm aperture was used to enable measurements 
over the range from 2 µm to 60 µm.  The conductive fluid was an aqueous solution of 0.8 % mass fraction NaCl.  The 
size distributions measured for the ten bottles of SRM 1003c, selected by stratified random sampling, are given in 
Table 3. 
 
Laser Light Scattering  
 
LLS also uses a suspension of particles in a fluid. Although the glass beads disperse easily in water, in order to utilize a 
common sample preparation for the ESZ and LLS measurements, the same saline solution was used for both techniques. 
Approximately 0.4 g powder was added to 20 ml solution in a cuvet.  The cuvet was capped and shaken to disperse the 
particles.  Aliquots of approximately 0.5 ml were taken by pipette to inject into the measuring system.  Sufficient aliquots 
were added until the instrument indicated an acceptable concentration.  The LLS technique uses approximations to the 
Mie scattering theory to convert the measured scattering pattern to particle size distribution.  Mie theory includes the 
influence of diffraction, refraction, reflection and polarization effects.  This theory requires that we know the real and 
imaginary refractive indices of the particles and the suspending medium and that the particles are optically homogeneous, 
smooth spheres.  The use of glass spheres in a transparent medium is a nearly ideal design to satisfy the Mie assumptions. 
 A refractive index of 1.5, with an imaginary component of zero, was used for the soda lime glass.  The size distributions 
measured by LLS, for the same ten bottles measured by ESZ, are given in Table 4.  A graphical comparison of the mean 
distribution measured by LLS with the mean distribution obtained by ESZ is shown in Figure 1. 
 
Certified Values and Uncertainty Determination:  The certified values and uncertainty estimates are shown in Table 1. 
The linear mixed-effects (lme) function from the nonlinear mixed-effects (nlme) library for the language S was used to fit 
the linear mixed-effects model using the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimation method [3,4].  The error 
analyses for the certified diameter values provided with the SRMs follow recommendations contained in the Guide to the 
Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement [5] and in NIST Technical Note 1297 [6].  Three sources of error were 
evaluated in determining the uncertainty values:  (1) Method accuracy, (2) Reproducibility of the measurements (i.e. 
measurement uncertainty in Table 1.), and (3) Bottle to bottle differences in the material (i.e. homogeneity uncertainty in 
Table 1).  The first of these is a Type B uncertainty obtained by analysis of the calibration results using SRM 1961 while 
the latter two are obtained by the REML analysis.  These uncertainty terms are combined using a root sum of squares to 
obtain a combined standard uncertainty.  Since there are sufficient data (>30), a Normal Distribution is assumed and thus 
the expanded uncertainty values can be obtained by multiplying the combined standard uncertainty by the coverage factor 
k = 2.  The value of the standard is believed to lie in the interval defined by the expanded uncertainty with a level of 
confidence of approximately 95 %. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 
 
SRM bottle must be kept tightly capped with a desiccator pack inside.  This is to prevent moisture absorption that can 
cause clumping of the powder.  In applications such as sieving where some beads will be lost with each use, when the 
unit’s loss exceeds 2 % of the original mass, or if spillage or contamination occurs, the certification will be nullified and 
use of the SRM unit should be discontinued. 
 
For sieve testing of this SRM, the entire bottle-unit of beads should be used.  The other techniques require much less 
material and special care must be exercised when taking subsamples from the SRM bottle.  The recommended procedure 
is to use a microriffler to divide the 28 g sample into subsamples until a suitable subsample mass is obtained. 
 
Sieve Analysis Procedure:  The sieve testing was designed to provide reference values for sieve analysis.  Eight bottles 
were selected using a stratified random sampling plan.  Mechanical sieving was done following recommendations in 
ASTM STP 447 [7].  The entire bottle of beads was poured onto the top sieve and the sieves were then shaken for 
20 minutes.  After the shaking was completed, the stack of sieves was disassembled, and the beads removed from each 
sieve and weighed to a precision of 0.01 g.  The mass of beads retained on each sieve was used to calculate, by difference 
from the total mass, the mass fraction percent that is finer for each sieve, (i.e., the ratio of the mass of beads passing 
through a sieve to the total mass). The results of sieving for each bottle are given in Table 5 as mass percent of beads 
passing through each successive screen. Table 6 shows a comparison of the nominal sieve opening with the effective 
sieve size opening.  This is determined by matching the mass fraction of beads passing through each sieve with the values 
in Table 1.  The corresponding diameter from Table 1 is then the effective sieve opening.  For example, the average 
percentage passing the No. 400 screen for all bottles tested was 71.1 %.  Interpolation between the 70 % (36.2 µm) and 
75 % (37.4 µm) values gives an effective opening of 36.5 µm.  This compares with the nominal opening of 38 µm.  Each

of the effective diameters is well within the ASTM specification [7] for permissible variation of average opening from 
the nominal sieve opening.  
 
Using Calibrated Glass Beads for the Evaluation of the Effective Opening of Test Sieves:  The allowed variation in 
sieve openings makes it difficult to compare size determinations made with different sets of sieves even though each set 
complies with the applicable ASTM, ANSI, or ISO test standard.  The aperture size of a sieve can be determined as the 
average size of the openings in the sieve.  However, the purpose of a sieve is to measure the size of particles and, 
therefore, it is the effective opening that must be determined.  This effective opening is determined by the size of the 
calibrated glass spheres that will just pass through the sieve.  This in turn permits the measurement of the particle size of 
an unknown material that will also just pass through the sieve. 
 
The openings of a sieve are not all the same size, and particles that are coarser than the average opening can pass through 
the larger holes.  In addition, the separation achieved by a sieve is not sharp.  A few particles capable of passing the sieve 
are always retained.  The number of particles retained or passed depends on the manner and time of shaking and any 
measurement of the effective opening must take these variables into account.  To a large extent, the glass sphere method 
of  calibration  automatically  includes  these  effects  because  the  sieves  are  shaken  in  the  same  manner,  when  being 
calibrated, as when measuring an unknown material. 
 
The sieve openings are essentially square and particles of irregular shape can pass through although one dimension of the 
particle is considerably larger than the size of the opening.  The average dimension of irregular particles that pass a sieve 
cannot be considered equal to the effective opening of the sieve as measured by the diameter of spheres that just pass. 
 
To evaluate the effective opening of standard 203 mm (8 in) or 305 mm (12 in) diameter test sieves with this SRM, the 
entire bottle of beads should be poured onto the top sieve screen.  The sieves are then shaken in the same manner as done 
in routine analysis.  To prevent blinding of a screen, the beads should not be used with a single screen; it is recommended 
that two relief screens be used to reduce the mass of beads.  A rough rule of thumb is to keep the loading below six layers 
of beads.  For use with 76 mm (3 in) diameter test sieves, the mass of beads must be reduced with a spinning riffler. 
 
After the shaking has been completed, the stack of sieves is disassembled, and the beads are removed from each sieve 
and placed into a suitable weighing bottle.  To reduce loss of material during this step, the transfer operation should 
utilize a large funnel or be carried out over glazed paper to recover any spillage.  A soft brush is useful in removing the 
beads from the sieve and funnel. 
 
Each of the sieve fractions is weighed to a precision of at least 0.01 g.  After weighing, all beads are returned to the 
original SRM bottle and kept for reuse.  The mass of beads retained on each sieve was used to calculate, by difference 
from the total mass, the mass fraction percent that is finer for each sieve. The effective size of the sieve opening is 
determined by interpolation between the nearest values given in Table 1. 
 
The above calibration procedure is for use in comparison of sieve results and as a method to systematically monitor for 
changes in screens after service.  The compliance of wire cloth sieves according to ASTM E-11 specifications can be 
tested by contacting the NIST Calibration Program at (301) 975-2200. 
 
Scanning Electron Microscopy Analysis 
 
The  cumulative  volume  (mass)  distribution  was  determined  using  scanning  electron  microscopy  and  based  on  the 
measurement of approximately one thousand individual beads from two bottles.  The backscatter electron images of the 
particles were acquired as greyscale image files into a computer via a digital interface.  The 2048  2048 pixel images 
were analyzed to obtain the major and minor diameters of each glass bead based on the assumption of ellipsoidal particle 
shape.  These diameters were converted to a particle volume (prolate spheroid) and particle diameter (geometric mean of 
major and minor diameters).  The pixel to length conversion was calibrated by collecting digital images of the calibrated 
standard NIST SRM 484e.  The SEM results for cumulative mass distribution of the two samples is given in Table 2 as a 
listing of particle diameter versus cumulative mass fraction with the mass fraction sequenced from 5 % to 95 % in 5 % 
increments.
