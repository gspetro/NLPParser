Certificate of Analysis 
 
Standard Reference Material 885 
 
Refined Copper 
 
(pin form) 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended primarily for use in calibration and validation of instrumental 
methods of analysis used in determinations of sulfur and oxygen in copper and its alloys.  The material is in the form 
of pins approximately 13 mm long, each weighing slightly less than 1 g.  A unit of SRM 885 consists of one bottle 
containing 200 g of pins. 
 
Certified  Values:    Certified  values  for  constituents  of  SRM 885  are  listed  in Table 1 [1]  as  mass  fractions  of  the 
elements in a copper  matrix.   A  NIST certified value is a  value for  which NIST has the highest confidence in its 
accuracy, in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been taken into account [2].  A certified value is the 
present best estimate of the true value.  The certified values are metrologically traceable to the SI derived unit of mass 
fraction  expressed  as  percent (%).    The  combined  standard  uncertainties  are  expressed  at  a  confidence  level  of 
approximately 68 %.

Expiration of Certification:  The certification of  SRM 885 is valid indefinitely, within the uncertainty specified, 
provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given in this certificate (see “Instructions 
for Storage, Handling, and Use”).  Periodic recertification of this SRM is not required.  The certification is nullified

INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE, HANDLING, AND USE 
 
To relate analytical determinations to the values on this Certificate of Analysis, a minimum sample quantity of one 
pin (approximately 1 g) is recommended.  The pins have a natural oxide surface coating that must be removed prior 
to measurements for determination of the bulk oxygen content.  Test methods may specify the process for removal of 
the surface coating.  The material should be stored in its original container in a cool, dry location. 
 
ADDITIONAL CONSTITUENTS:  Noncertified values are provided for the following additional constituents in 
SRM 885. 
 
Information Mass Fraction Values:  Information values for SRM 885 are reported as mass fractions in Table 2.  An 
information value is a value that may be of interest to the SRM user, but insufficient information is available to assess 
the uncertainty associated with the value [2].  Information values cannot be used to establish metrological traceability.

PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
The material for SRM 885 was prepared by A. Cardinal, Phelps Dodge Refining Corp. (El Paso, TX). 
 
Cooperative  analyses  for  certification  were  performed  in  the  following  laboratories:    J. Anselmo,  Accredited 
Laboratories,  Inc.  (Carteret, NJ);  D. Neill,  Asarco  Inc.  (Amarillo, TX);  G.W. Self,  Asarco  Inc.  (Hayden, AZ); 
L.E. Creasy, Axel Johnson Metals, Inc. (Exton, PA); R. Hertz, J.A. Horner and J. Beard, Brush Wellman Engineered 
Materials (Elmore, OH); J. Schuster, Cerro Copper Products Co. (St. Louis, MO); T.A. Appelman, Magma Copper 
Co. (San Manuel, AZ); E. Ackall, A. Cardinal and E.C. Thompson, Phelps Dodge Refining Corp. (El Paso, TX); and 
J.F. Brewton, D. Lanier and J. Maxwell, Southwire Co. (Carrollton, GA). 
 
The estimated uncertainty listed for a constituent is based on judgment and represents an evaluation of the combined 
effects of method imprecision, possible systematic errors among methods, and material variability.  No attempt was 
made to derive exact statistical measures of imprecision because several methods were involved in the determination 
of most constituents. 
 
 

 

                                                           

(1)  Certain commercial equipment, instrumentation, or materials are identified in this certificate to adequately specify the 
experimental  procedure.    Such  identification  does  not  imply  recommendation  or  endorsement  by  the  National  Institutes  of 
Standards and Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the 
purpose.
