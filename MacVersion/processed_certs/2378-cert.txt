Standard Reference Material 2378 

 
Fatty Acids in Frozen Human Serum 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended primarily for validation of methods for determining fatty acids 
in human serum and similar materials.  A unit of SRM 2378 consists of three vials, each containing approximately 
1.0 mL of frozen serum with different concentrations of fatty acids (Serum 1, Serum 2, and Serum 3). 
 
SRM 2378 was produced in response to a need expressed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
and in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health, Office of Dietary Supplements (NIH-ODS).  Analyses for 
value assignment were performed by NIST and the CDC. 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values:  The certified mass fraction and concentration values of fatty acids are provided in 
Table 1.  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that all known 
or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [1]. 
 
Reference Mass Fraction Values:  Reference mass fraction and concentration values are listed for additional fatty 
acids in Table 2.  A NIST reference value is a noncertified value that is the best estimate of the true value based on 
available data; however, the value does not meet the NIST criteria for certification and is provided with associated 
uncertainties that may reflect only measurement reproducibility, may not include all sources of uncertainty, or may 
reflect a lack of sufficient statistical agreement among multiple analytical methods [1]. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 2378 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until 30 September 2025, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given in this 
certificate  (see  “Instructions  for  Storage  and  Use”).    This  certification  is  nullified  if  the  SRM  is  damaged, 
contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Overall  direction  and  coordination  of  the  technical  measurements  leading  to  the  certification  of  this  SRM  were 
performed  by  K.E. Sharpless,  M.M.  Schantz,  B.A. Benner, Jr.,  L.C.  Sander,  and  S.A. Wise  of  the  NIST  Chemical 
Sciences Division. 
 
Acquisition and preparation of the SRM were coordinated by K.E. Sharpless, and M.M. Schantz. 
 
Analytical measurements at NIST were performed by M.M. Schantz, B.A. Benner, Jr., and L.T. Sniegoski of the NIST 
Chemical Sciences Division.  Analytical measurements at the CDC were provided by C.M. Pfeiffer, C.D. Powers, and 
R.L. Schleicher. 
 
Support for the development of SRM 2378 Fatty Acids in Human Serum was provided in part by NIH-ODS.  Technical 
consultation was provided by J.M. Betz of NIH-ODS. 
 
Statistical analysis was provided by J.H. Yen of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division. 
 
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Office  of  Reference 
Materials.

NOTICE AND WARNING TO USERS 
 
SRM 2378  IS  INTENDED  FOR  RESEARCH  USE.    THIS  IS  A  HUMAN  SOURCE  MATERIAL.    HANDLE 
PRODUCT AS A BIOHAZARDOUS MATERIAL CAPABLE OF TRANSMITTING INFECTIOUS DISEASE.  The 
supplier has reported that each donor unit of  serum used in the preparation of this product was tested by Food and 
Drug Administration licensed tests and found to be negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), HIV-1 antigen, 
hepatitis B  surface  antigen,  and  hepatitis C.    However,  no  known  test  method  can  offer  complete  assurance  that 
hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, HIV, or other infectious agents are absent from this material.  Accordingly, this 
human  blood-based  product  should  be  handled  at  the  Biosafety  Level 2  or  higher  as  recommended  for  any 
POTENTIALLY INFECTIOUS HUMAN SERUM OR BLOOD SPECIMEN in the CDC/NIH Manual [2]. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE AND USE 
 
Storage:  The SRM should be stored at –80 °C in the original unopened vials.  The certification does not apply to 
contents of previously opened vials as the stabilities of the analytes have not been investigated. 
 
Use:  SRM 2378 is provided as frozen serum that should thaw at room temperature in approximately 30 min under 
subdued light prior to use.  After the material is thawed, it should be used immediately.  The contents of the vial should 
be gently mixed prior to removal of a test portion for analysis.  Precautions should be taken to avoid exposure to strong 
UV light and direct sunlight. 
 
SOURCE, PREPARATION, AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Source and Preparation:  Donor serum  for SRM 2378 was collected from three groups of individuals:  Serum 1, 
three healthy donors who took 1000 mg/day of fish oil supplements for a minimum of one month prior to collection; 
Serum 2, three healthy donors who took 1000 mg/day of flaxseed oil supplements for a minimum of one month prior 
to collection; and Serum 3, three healthy donors who did not take either fish or flaxseed oil supplements for one month 
prior to collection. 
 
Homogeneity Assessment:  The homogeneity of the material was assessed at NIST using the NIST-1 sulfuric acid in 
methanol derivatization method for the certified and reference values and test portion sizes described below; analysis 
of variance did not show statistically significant heterogeneity.  The reported analytes have been treated as though 
they are homogeneously distributed in the material; the homogeneity of the other analytes present in the material and 
not reported by NIST and/or CDC was not assessed. 
 
Value Assignment:  Means of data sets from individual methods were combined to provide assigned values.  The 
NIST  measured  serum  densities  are  1.02259 g/mL  0.00006 g/mL,  1.02320 g/mL  0.00011 g/mL,  and 
1.02212 g/mL  0.00001 g/mL, for SRM 2378 Sera 1, 2, and 3, respectively.  The uncertainties for the serum densities 
were incorporated in values that are reported in Tables 1 and 2 relative to units of volume. 
 
Analytical Approach for Determination of Fatty Acids 
 
Determination of Fatty Acids (NIST-1):  For the homogeneity measurements performed at NIST, an internal standard 
solution containing palmitic-d31 acid and heneicosanoic acid was used.  The samples (two aliquots, 0.5 g each, from 
each of 10 vials for each of the three sera) were saponified in methanolic KOH and esterified using sulfuric acid in 
methanol [3].  The samples were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) with flame ionization detection (FID) using 
a 0.25 mm × 100 m biscyanopropyl polysiloxane fused silica capillary column. 
 
Determination of Fatty Acids (NIST-2 and CDC):  NIST-2 and the CDC methods determined total fatty acids using 
isotope dilution GC/mass spectrometry (ID-GC-MS) based on Langerstedt’s method [4] using four aliquots of 0.1 g 
serum  for  the  NIST-2  method  (actual  masses  determined)  and  three  0.10 mL  aliquots  for  the  CDC  method.   This 
procedure hydrolyzes fatty acids from cholesteryl esters, triglycerides, and phospholipids using sequential addition of 
acetonitrile:hydrochloric acid and methanol:sodium hydroxide in the presence of heat.  The hydrolysis procedure for 
the NIST-2 measurements used microwave-assisted digestions of the sera samples for 45 min at 100 °C ( 5 °C) using 
acetonitrile:hydrochloric  acid.    Total  fatty  acids  were  extracted  in  hexane,  concentrated,  derivatized  using 
pentafluorobenzyl bromide (PFB), and reconstituted in hexane.  Fatty acids were quantified using four (NIST-2) and 

                                                           

(1) Certain commercial equipment, instruments, or materials are identified in this certificate in order to adequately specify 
the  experimental  procedure.    Such  identification  does  not  imply  recommendation  or  endorsement  by  the  National  Institute  of 
Standards and Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the 
purpose.

ten (CDC)  isotopically  labeled  internal  standards  after  separation  on  a  30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm,  5 %  (mole 
fraction) phenylmethyl-substituted polysiloxane column (NIST-2) and 60 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 µm, 50 % cyanopropyl 
+ 50 % phenylpolysiloxane column (CDC).  Fragmentation of fatty acid-PFB esters by negative chemical ionization 
(electron capture ionization) resulted in a reproducible loss of the PFB moiety giving a stable carboxylate anion (M-
1)–. 
 
Interlaboratory Analytical Comparison Study of Total Fatty Acid Concentrations in Human Serum:  SRM 2378 was 
distributed as study samples to 12 laboratories for an interlaboratory comparison in May 2012 [8].  The laboratories 
were provided with four vials of each material and were requested to do triplicate measurements  for each material 
(three sera of SRM 2378) using their laboratory's and/or program's analytical protocols for the fatty acids currently 
determined  in  their  laboratory.    The  results  from  this  study  were  used  to  confirm  the  values  determined  during 
certification measurements by the methods described above.

Certified Values for Fatty Acids:  Certified values for fatty acids are means of the method means from analyses at NIST using ID-GC-MS and/or GC-FID and from CDC using 
ID-GC-MS.  The uncertainty provided with each value is an expanded uncertainty about the mean to cover the measurand, the fatty acid concentration.  The expanded uncertainty 
is calculated as U = kuc, where uc incorporates the observed difference between the results from the methods and their respective uncertainties, consistently with the ISO/JCGM 
Guide and with its Supplement 1, and k is a coverage factor, where k = 2.0, corresponding to approximately 95 % confidence [5–7].  See the footnotes for the specific analytical 
methods used in determining the certified values.  The measurands are the lipids listed in Table 1, and metrological traceability is to the SI derived units for mass fraction (expressed 
as micrograms per gram) and amount-of-substance concentration (expressed as micromoles per liter).

Reference Values for Fatty Acids:  Reference values for fatty acids are provided below with method designations described in footnotes.  The values are calculated as the means 
of the values provided by the methods used.  The uncertainty provided with each value is an expanded uncertainty about the mean to cover the measurand with approximately 95 % 
confidence.  The expanded uncertainty is calculated as U = kuc, where uc is the combined uncertainty, consistent with the ISO/JCGM Guide, and k is a coverage factor corresponding 
to approximately 95 % confidence [5–7].  See the footnotes for the coverage factors used in the calculations.  The measurands are the lipids listed in Table 2 as determined by the 
indicated methods, and metrological traceability is to the SI derived units for mass fraction (expressed as micrograms per gram) and amount-of-substance concentration (expressed 
as micromoles per liter).
