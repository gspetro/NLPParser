Report of Investigation 
 
Reference Material® 8027 
 
Silicon Nanoparticles (Nominal Diameter 2 nm) 
 
This  Reference  Material (RM)  is  intended  primarily  to  evaluate  and  qualify  methodology  and/or  instrument 
performance related to the physical/dimensional characterization of nanoscale particles.  The RM may also be useful 
in the development of in vitro assays designed to evaluate the biological response of nanomaterials and for use in 
interlaboratory test comparisons.  A unit of RM 8027 consists of five hermetically sealed pre-scored glass ampoules 
containing  nominally  1 mL  of  cyclohexane-stabilized  silicon (Si)  nanoparticles  suspended  in  toluene.    The 
suspension contains particles (monomers) and a small percentage of clusters of primary particles. 
 
Reference Values:  Reference mean size and mass fraction values derived from Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) 
and  Inductively  Coupled  Plasma-Optical  Emission  Spectrometry (ICP-OES)  measurements  respectively,  are 
provided in Table 1.  Reference values are non-certified values that are the present best estimates of the true values; 
however,  the  values do  not meet  the  NIST  criteria for  certification  and are provided with  associated uncertainties 
that  may  reflect  only  measurement  precision,  may  not  include  all  sources  of  uncertainty,  or  may  reflect  a  lack  of 
sufficient agreement among multiple analytical methods [1]. 

Information Values:  Information particle mean size values using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and 
Analytical Ultracentrifugation (AUC) are provided in Table 2.  An information value is considered to be a value that 
will be of interest to the RM user, but insufficient information is available to assess the uncertainty associated with 
the value or only a limited number of analyses were performed [1].  Information values cannot be used to establish 
metrological traceability. 
 
Expiration  of  Value  Assignment:    The  values  of  RM 8027  are  valid,  within  the  measurement  uncertainty 
specified, until 01 August 2018, provided the RM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given in 
this report (see “Instructions for Handling, Storage, and Use”).  Accordingly, periodic recalibration or recertification 
of this RM is not required.  The report is nullified if the RM is damaged, contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of RM:  NIST will monitor this RM over the period of its value assignment.  If substantive changes 
occur  that  affect  the  value  assignment  before  the  expiration  of  this  report,  NIST  will  notify  the  purchaser.  
Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
Overall  technical  coordination  for  material  preparation,  processing  and  measurement  activities  was  conducted  by 
V. Reipa  of  the  NIST  Biosystems  and  Biomaterials  Division  and  K. Nontapot  of  the  Thai  National  Metrology 
Institute.

Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  RM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Office  of  Reference 
Materials. 
 
Value  Assignment  and  Uncertainty  Analysis:    Analyses  to  establish  reference  values  were  conducted  at  NIST 
using  best  practices  as  determined  independently  for  each  measurement  method.    DLS  reference  values  were 
calculated from the ampoule means and the expanded uncertainty was calculated as U = kuc, where uc is intended to 
represent,  at  the  level  of  one  standard  deviation,  the  combined  standard  uncertainty  calculated  according  to  the 
ISO/JCGM and NIST Guides [2,3].  The coverage factor k = 2, for 95 % expanded uncertainty intervals is based on 
a  t multiplier  with  29 associated  degrees  of  freedom.    For  the  Silicon  mass  fraction  value  using  ICP-OES, 
components of uncertainty were determined according to the ISO/JCGM Guide [2].  For the uncertainty components 
estimated using Type A and Type B approaches, the effective degrees of freedom were calculated for each approach 
using the Welch-Satterthwaite formula and then combined.  The expanded uncertainty (U) was obtained as follows: 
 

U =

NOTICE AND WARNINGS TO USERS 
 
RM 8027  is  NOT  intended  for  clinical  use  or  human  consumption.    NO  SONICATION  should  be  applied  to  this 
reference material.  Appearance of a milky substance indicates that the RM has been compromised.   
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING STORAGE, AND USE 
 
Handling  and  Storage:    Until  required  for  use,  the  RM  should  be  stored  at  room  temperature  in  its  original 
ampoule and package, and protected from intense direct light or ultraviolet radiation.  Refrigeration below 0 ºC or 
heating above 40 ºC is discouraged.  Ampoules are best stored long term in a horizontal position. 
 
Use:  Consult the Safety Data Sheet (SDS), enclosed with the RM shipment, for chemical hazard information.  Prior 
to  opening,  the  glass  ampoule  containing  the  RM  should  be  gently  inverted  several  times  to  insure  homogeneity.  
Liquid retained in the upper portion of the ampoule (the nipple), can be dislodged by gently flicking the nipple with 
forefinger  while  tilting  the  ampoule.    The  ampoule  is  pre-scored  and  should  be  opened  by  applying  moderate 
pressure with one’s thumb to snap off the nipple.  It is recommended that the contents of an ampoule be used the 
same day as opened.

PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Material  Source  and  Processing:    RM 8027  was  prepared  at  the  NIST  Biosystems  and  Biomaterials  Division.  
Si wafers  (<111>,  Boron  doped),  were  purchased  from  a  commercial  supplier.    The  wafers  were  etched  using 
hydrofluoric  acid  and  placed  in  a  beaker  containing  toluene.    The  wafers  were  then  sonicated  to  produce  a 
suspension.    Particle  surface  passivation  with  cyclohexane  was  done  by  hydrosilylation  under  ultraviolet 
excitation [5].    A  two  stage  filtering  was  used  to  remove  larger  particulates  from  the  Si nanoparticle  colloidal 
suspension in toluene.  A 100 nm pore size 90 mm diameter polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) based filter membrane 
was used in the first stage and 20 nm pore size 47 mm diameter Anodisc 47 circular membrane filters in the second 
stage.  The suspension was transferred to a clean 4 L capacity dark glass bottle and hermetically sealed.  This RM 
was  subsequently  flame-sealed  into  2 mL  pre-scored  amber  glass  ampoules  using  an  automated  process.    Prior  to 
use,  the  ampoules  were  cleaned  with  high  pressure  deionized  water  and  autoclaved,  then  flushed  with  argon  gas 
prior and during filling. 
 
Analysis  with  DLS:    DLS  measurements  were  performed  at  the  NIST  Biosystems  and  Biomaterials  Division.  
Si nanoparticle hydrodynamic radius measurements were performed using a Nicomp 380 ZLS DLS system (Particle 
Sizing Systems Inc., Santa Barbara, CA).  Samples were contained in glass disposable culture tubes.  Prior to sample 
loading, the tubes were blown with nitrogen gas and filled with 0.3 ml of the RM sample from the ampoule.  The 
tubes were sealed using parafilm and were then centrifuged at 14 000 rpm for 5 min to separate larger particles and 
dust.    Samples  were  placed  in  the  instrument  and  allowed  to  reach  thermal  equilibrium.    A  nanoparticle  DLS 
measurement  protocol  as  described  by  the  ISO 13321 [6]  standard  was  followed.    A  Laplace  inversion  based 
Nicomp routine was used to find the distribution of decay rates.  The decay rates are linked to the effective-sphere 
hydrodynamic diameters by the appropriate equations.  The size distribution is reported as a discrete set of diameter 
bins  and  corresponding  intensity-weighted  fractions  as  probabilities  assigned  to  diameter  bins.    The  numbers 
provided  from  the  instrument  were  normalized  such  that  the  largest  probability  (rather  than  the  sum  of  all 
probabilities) was one for each ampoule.  Before further analysis, probabilities were renormalized so that the sum of 
all  probabilities  was  one  for  each  ampoule.    To  extract  an  estimated  mean  from  each  ampoule,  least  squares 
                                                 

(1) Certain  commercial  equipment,  instruments  or  materials  are  identified  in  this  report  to  adequately  specify  the 
experimental  procedure.    Such  identification  does  not  imply  recommendation  or  endorsement  by  the  National  Institute  of

Standards and Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the 
purpose.

optimization was used to fit a three-parameter gamma distribution to the normalized probabilities.  Reference values 
were determined based on intensity based distribution as measured by DLS. 
 
DLS  Instrument Variability Assessment:    Additional  measurements  were  performed  at  NIST  on four randomly 
selected samples using two other DLS instruments from different manufacturers to assess instrument effects.  These 
machines  differed  in  scattering  angle,  laser  wavelength  and  data  analysis  software.    On  each  instrument,  four 
ampoules of RM 8027 (nominal 2 nm), one sample of a 90 nm latex particle standard, and three samples of a 10 nm 
particle  standard  were  measured.    Means  were  estimated  in  the  same  manner  as  previously  described.    A  95 % 
posterior  credible  interval  for  the  consensus  mean  of  measurements  was  taken  with  a  90 degree  scattering  angle 
based  on  a  Markov  chain  Monte  Carlo  fit  for  a  linear  model  that  included  random  machine  effects.    Analysis  of 
Variance (ANOVA) of  the  nominal  10 nm  particle  data,  the  fixed  machine  effect  factor  had  an  F-statistic  of  1.10 
with 2 and 6 degrees of freedom and a corresponding p-value of 0.39.  ANOVA of the nominal 2 nm particle data, 
the  fixed  machine  effect  factor  had  an  F-statistic  of  0.87  with  2  and  9 degrees  of  freedom  and  a  corresponding 
p-value of 0.39.  This data indicated there is no statistically significant evidence of machine-to-machine variability.  
 
Analysis  with  ICP-OES:    Six  ampoules  of  RM 8027  were  used  for  the  analysis.    A  solution  of  known 
Si concentration  was  used  as  a  control [7].    Sample  sizes  of  0.5 g  to  0.7 g  were  chosen  for  RM 8027  and  the 
control.  Two aliquots were removed from each ampoule of RM 8027.  Four samples from the control RM and six 
blanks were prepared for the analysis.  All samples were placed into 30 ml polyethylene bottles along with 2 mL of 
concentrated  tetramethylammonium  hydroxide (TMAH).    For  the  controls  and  blanks,  0.5 g  of  toluene  was  also 
added  to  mimic  the  matrix  of  RM 8027.    The  samples  were  capped  and  left  undisturbed  for  3 days  to  4 days  to 
allow  digestion  of  the  Si  nanoparticles.    All  solutions  were  transferred  to  PTFE  beakers,  evaporated  and 
reconstituted  with  25 g  of  pure  water.    The  final  solutions  contained  1 µg/g  of  phosphorus [8]  as  an  internal 
standard in 2 %  TMAH.  To determine the Si mass fraction in RM 8027, the calibration was performed using the 
method of standard additions to compensate for any matrix effects.  A Si spike solution was prepared from a silicon 
standard [7].  Each sample was split into two subsamples  and one of them was spiked with 0.5 g of the Si spike 
stock  solution  (1.43 µg/g Si).    A  PerkinElmer  Optima 5300  DV  ICP-OES  instrument  was  used  for  the  analysis.  
The Si mass fraction in the samples was measured using 251.611 nm wavelength; while the P mass fraction in the 
samples was measured using 213.617 nm wavelength; both Si and P used axial plasma view, an integration time 
of 0.512 s and a read time of 8.192 s for the measurement.  Each sample measurement comprised five replicates, 
and each solution was measured two different times for the analysis. 
 
Heterogeneity  Assignment:    During  the  filling  process,  ampoules  were  stored  in  boxes  numbered  1  through  10, 
with  box  number  corresponding  to  fill  order.    Homogeneity  testing  was  performed  using  measurements  of 
hydrodynamic  size,  and  Si  mass  fraction.    For  hydrodynamic  radius  measurements  using  DLS,  one  sample  was 
removed from each of 30 randomly selected ampoules (three from each box), for a total of 30 samples.  To extract 
an  estimated  mean  from  each  ampoule,  least  squares  optimization  was  used  to  fit  a  three-parameter  gamma 
distribution to the normalized probabilities.  A model including random day effects showed the estimated standard 
deviation for day, 1.9 E–06 nm, was dominated by that for error, 0.209 nm.  A model allowing for fixed day effects 
had a p-value of 0.702.  Thus, a single mean model was fit to the entire collection of data from all 30 ampoules.  The 
variability  attributed  to  measurement  error  was  estimated  from  four  replicate  measurements  from  each  of  three 
ampoules.    An  ANOVA  with  a  fixed  effect  for  an  ampoule  provided  an  estimated  variance  for  repeated 
measurements on a single sample of 0.051668 with 9 degrees of freedom.  The F-statistic for an ampoule was 0.685 
with 2 and 9 degrees of freedom and a corresponding p-value of 0.529, indicating there is no statistically significant 
evidence of sample heterogeneity between ampoules. 
 
Si  content  was  evaluated  using  ICP-OES  performed  on  two  samples  extracted  gravimetrically  from  each  of  six 
randomly  selected  ampoules.    Sample  sizes  of  0.5 g  to  0.7 g  were  chosen  for  RM 8027  and  a  control [7].    Two 
aliquots  were  removed  from  each  ampoule  of  RM 8027.    Four  samples  from  the  control,  and  six  blanks  were 
prepared for the analysis.  Analysis followed addition of an internal standard [8], TMAH digestion, and dilution with 
high-purity water.  The relative expanded uncertainty value for the experimental Si mass fraction for RM 8027 was 
4.8 %.    Based  on  a  single  factor  ANOVA,  the  observed  differences  are  not  significant  among  the  ampoules  for 
RM 8027 and therefore, heterogeneity was considered to be minimal.
