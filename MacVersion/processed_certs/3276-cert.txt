Certificate of Analysis 
Standard Reference Material® 3276 

 

 
Carrot Extract in Oil 

 
This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  use  in  validating  analytical  methods  for  the 
determination  of  tocopherols  and  fatty  acids  in  carrot  extract  in  oil  and  similar  matrices.   This  SRM  may  also  be 
used for quality assurance when assigning values to in-house control materials.  A unit of SRM 3276 consists of five 
ampoules of the oil, each containing approximately 1 mL of material. 
 
The  development  of  SRM 3276  was  a  collaboration  between  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and 
Technology (NIST) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS). 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values:  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its 
accuracy  in  that  all  known  or  suspected  sources  of  bias  have  been  investigated  or  taken  into  account [1].    The 
certified mass fraction values of selected tocopherols and fatty acids are provided in Tables 1 and 2.  Values were 
derived  from  the  combination  of  results  provided  by  NIST  and,  in  the  case  of  tocopherols,  by  collaborating 
laboratories.   The  certified  values  in  this  material  are  the  equally  weighted  means  of  the  individual  sets  of  NIST 
results and the medians of the individual sets of measurements made by collaborating laboratories.  The associated 
uncertainties are expanded uncertainties at the 95 % level of confidence [2,3].  Values are reported on an “as-received” 
basis in mass fraction units [4]. 
 
Expiration  of  Certification:    The  certification  of  SRM 3276  is  valid,  within  the  measurement  uncertainty 
specified, until 30 September 2017, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with instructions given 
in  this  certificate  (see  “Instructions  for  Storage  and  Use”).    The  certification  is  nullified  if  the  SRM  is  damaged, 
contaminated, or otherwise modified.  
 
Maintenance  of  SRM  Certification:    NIST  will  monitor  this  SRM  over  the  period  of  its  certification.    If 
substantive  technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST will 
notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
Coordination of the technical measurements leading to the certification of this SRM was performed by L.C. Sander, 
K.E. Sharpless,  and  S.A. Wise  of  the  NIST  Analytical  Chemistry  Division.    Support  for  the  development  of 
SRM 3276 was provided in part by NIH-ODS.  Technical consultation was provided by J.M. Betz of NIH-ODS. 
 
Acquisition and preparation of the material was coordinated by K.E. Sharpless.  Analytical measurements at NIST 
were  performed  by  K. Putzbach,  C.A. Rimmer,  M.M. Schantz,  J.B. Thomas,  and  T. Yarita  of  the  NIST 
Analytical Chemistry Division. 
 
Statistical analysis was provided by J.H. Yen of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division and D.L. Duewer of the 
NIST Analytical Chemistry Division. 
 
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Measurement  Services 
Division.

WARNING TO USERS 
 
For laboratory use only.  Not for human consumption. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE AND USE 
 
Storage:  The material should be stored under refrigeration (0 °C to 4 °C), in an unopened ampoule, until required for 
use.  
 
Use:  Prior to removal of a test portion for analysis, the contents of an ampoule of material should be allowed to 
warm  to  room  temperature  and  mixed  thoroughly.    Test  portions  used  for  NIST  analyses  described  below  were 
70 mg to 90 mg for tocopherols and 20 mg to 100 mg for fatty acids. 
 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Material  Acquisition  and  Preparation:    Carrot  extract  in  oil  (6.32 kg)  was  combined  with  4.24 g  butylated 
hydroxytoluene (BHT) to yield a final BHT mass fraction of approximately 670 mg/kg.  To facilitate dissolution of 
the BHT, the mixture was sonicated, manually shaken, and stirred overnight using a magnetic stir bar.  SRM 3276 
was ampouled under argon with each ampoule containing approximately 1 mL of oil. 
 
Analytical Approach for Determination of Tocopherols:  Value assignment of the mass fractions of tocopherols 
in SRM 3276 was based on the combination of measurements from three different analytical methods at NIST and 
from laboratories participating in the NIST Micronutrients Measurement Quality Assurance Program (QA Program).  
NIST provided measurements by using a combination of three liquid chromatorgraphy (LC) methods with different 
detection methods (i.e., absorbance [abs] and fluorescence) as described below.  The laboratories in the QA Program 
used their usual methods. 
 
NIST Analyses  for Tocopherols:   Tocopherols  were  measured  by  using  combinations  of  three  LC  methods  with 
absorbance or fluorescence detection.  Four independently prepared calibrants were used for each of the methods.  
Calibrants were prepared gravimetrically, at levels intended to approximate the levels of the tocopherols in the SRM.  
A single internal standard solution was used for the calibrants and samples. 
 
Sample Preparation:  Two 20 mg to 40 mg test portions from each of six ampoules were diluted in about 250 mg 
(mass  known)  of  ethanol  for  LC/abs  Method 1.    Single  70 mg  to  80 mg  test  portions  were  diluted  with 
approximately equal volumes of an ethanolic tocol solution (internal standard), and then with an additional 750 mg 
ethanol for LC/abs Method 2.  Samples were analyzed by the LC methods below. 
 
LC/abs Method 1:  An  isocratic  LC  method  with  a  methanol/triethylamine/acetonitrile  mobile  phase  and  a 
polymeric C18 column was used for determination of tocopherols.  Absorbance detection wavelength was at 292 nm. 
 
LC/abs Method 2:  An isocratic LC method with a methanol/water mobile phase and a C30 column held at 5 C was 
used for LC/abs determination of tocopherols.  Absorbance detection wavelength was 295 nm. 
 
LC/fluorescence  Method:    An  isocratic  LC  method  with  a  methanol/water  mobile  phase  and  a  C30  column  was 
used  for  LC/fluorescence  determination  of  tocopherols.    The  excitation  wavelength  was  298 nm;  the  emission 
wavelength was measured 325 nm. 
 
Analytical Approach for Determination of Fatty Acids:  Value assignment of the mass fractions of the fatty acids 
in SRM 3276 was based on the combination of measurements from two different analytical methods at NIST.  NIST 
provided measurements by using a combination of two gas chromatography (GC) methods with different detection 
methods  (i.e.,  flame  ionization  detection [FID]  and  mass  spectrometry [MS])  as  described  below.    Four 
independently prepared calibrants were used for each of the methods.  Calibrants were prepared gravimetrically, at 
levels intended to approximate the levels of the fatty acids in the SRM.  A single internal standard solution was used 
for the calibrants and samples.

Sample  Preparation  Method  1:    Two  20 mg  test  portions  from  each  of  eight  ampoules  were  combined  with 
chloroform and an internal standard solution.  A two-step process involving methanolic sodium hydroxide and boron 
trifluoride was used to convert the fatty acids to their methyl esters.  Methyl esters were extracted into hexane three 
times,  and  the  combined  hexane  portions  were  concentrated  to  approximately  1 mL.    Samples  were  analyzed  by 
GC-FID. 
 
Sample  Preparation  Method  2:    Two  100 mg  test  portions  from  each  of  four  ampoules  were  combined  with 
benzene  and  an  internal  standard  solution.    Approximately  0.1 mL  of  MethPrep II  (0.1 mol/L  methanolic 
(m-trifluoromethylphenyl)trimethylammonium  hydroxide,  Alltech, Deerfield, IL)  was  added,  samples  were  mixed 
for 1 min, and allowed to sit for at least 1 h prior to analysis by GC/MS. 
 
GC-FID:  GC-FID was performed using a 0.25 mm × 100 m fused silica capillary column.  A typical separation is 
provided in the Appendix; note that the run time was longer than necessary for elution of the fatty acids to ensure 
that residual oil was eluted from the column. 
 
GC/MS:  GC/MS was performed using a 0.25 mm × 100 m fused silica capillary column.  The MS was operated 
both in the scan mode (200 amu to 400 amu) and in the single-ion monitoring (SIM) mode. 
 
Homogeneity  Assessment:    The  homogeneity  of  tocopherols  was  assessed  at  NIST  by  using  LC/abs  Method 1 
described above.  An analysis of variance did not show inhomogeneity for a 20 mg to 40 mg sample.  The fatty acids 
were  also  found  to  be  homogeneously  distributed  in  20 mg  and  100 mg  test  portions  using  the  GC-FID  method 
described above. 
 
Value Assignment:  For the tocopherols, the three individual NIST data set means were averaged with the median 
result of data provided by the QA Program laboratories to obtain the assigned value.  For the fatty acids, the two 
NIST data set means were averaged to obtain the assigned value. 
 
Values  for  β-carotene  isomers  in  this  SRM  were  originally  certified.    In 2008,  the  values  were  found  to  have 
changed.  New values for β-carotene isomers were assigned and values were changed from certified to reference in 
2008.    As  a  result  of  continued  instability,  the  reference  values  for  β-carotene  isomers  were  removed  from  the 
Certificate of Analysis in 2012. 

 
Certified Mass Fraction Values for Tocopherols:  Each certified value, expressed as a mass fraction, is an equally 
weighted  mean  of  the  individual  sets  of  results  provided  by  NIST  using  LC/abs Method 1,  LC/abs Method 2,  and 
LC/fluorescence, and the median of results provided by QA Program laboratories.  The uncertainty in the certified 
value,  calculated  according  to  the  method  described  in  the  ISO  Guide [2]  and  a  published  method  for  combined 
results [3], is expressed as an expanded uncertainty, U.  The expanded uncertainty is calculated as U = kuc, where uc 
is  intended  to  represent,  at  the  level  of  one  standard  deviation,  the  combined  effect  of  between-laboratory  and 
within-laboratory components of uncertainty.  The coverage factor (k) is determined from the Student's t-distribution 
corresponding  to  the  appropriate  associated  degrees  of  freedom  and  approximately  95 %  confidence  for  each 
analyte.
