Certificate of Analysis 
Standard Reference Material® 2783 

 

 
Air Particulate on Filter Media 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is an air particulate sample reduced in particle size to simulate PM2.5 air 
particulate matter (particles with an aerodynamic equivalent diameter of 2.5 µm) and deposited on a polycarbonate 
filter  membrane.    It  is  primarily  intended  for  use  in  the  evaluation  and  calibration  of  methods  of  analysis  for 
common and toxic elements contained in various fractions of airborne particulate matter collected on filter media.  
A unit of SRM 2783 includes two loaded filters and two blank filters. 
 
Certified Values:  The certified values for elemental content of the SRM, expressed as mass of element deposited 
on the filter membrane, are provided in Table 1.  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest 
confidence  in  its  accuracy  in  that  all  known  or  suspected  sources  of  bias  have  been  investigated  or  taken  into 
account [1].    The  certified  values  for  all  elements  are  based  on  results  of  NIST  methods  and  results  from 
collaborating laboratories using independent and complementary analytical methods. 
 
Reference Values:  The reference values for elemental content, expressed as mass of element deposited on the filter 
membrane, are provided in Table 2.  Reference values for selected elements in blank filters are provide in Table 4.  
Reference values are noncertified values that are the best estimate of the true value; however, the values do not meet 
the NIST criteria for certification and are provided with associated uncertainties that may reflect only measurement 
precision, may not include all sources of uncertainty, or may reflect a lack of sufficient statistical agreement among 
multiple analytical methods [1]. 
 
Information  Values:    Supplementary  information  values  for  average  deposit  area  and  mass  loading  per  loaded 
filter are provided in Table 3.  Information values for blank filters are provided in Table 5.  An information value is 
considered to be a value that will be of use to the SRM user, but insufficient information is available to assess the 
uncertainty associated with the value. 
 
Expiration  of  Certification:    The  certification  of  SRM 2783  is  valid,  within  the  measurement  uncertainty 
specified,  until  01 September 2021,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  the  instructions 
given  in  this  certificate  (see  “Instructions  for  Handling,  Storage,  and  Use”).    This  certification  is  nullified  if  the 
SRM is damaged, contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance  of  SRM  Certification:    NIST  will  monitor  this  SRM  over  the  period  of  its  certification.    If 
substantive technical changes occur that affect the certification before the expiration of this certificate, NIST will 
notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
This SRM has been developed in cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Laboratories, 
Seibersdorf, Austria and collaborating laboratories in several countries. 
 
The  material  was  prepared  by  R. Oflaz  and  R.L. Zeisler  of  the  NIST  Analytical  Chemistry  Division.    The 
coordination of the technical measurements leading to certification was performed by R.L. Zeisler.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE(1) 
 
Handling:  Please note that no fixation or surface coating was used on the filters, therefore they should be handled 
with  care  to  avoid  material  loss  or  contamination.    The  filter  membranes  are  mounted  in  Millipore  PetriSlide 
containers (Figure 1).  These containers are holding the filter membranes in place by means of a plastic ring inside 
the lid.  To remove the filter from the container, grasp the lid with the thumb and finger of one hand at the grip, 
while holding the slide, i.e., bottom portion of the casing, with the other hand.  The lid is then opened with a slight 
twisting  upward  motion.    Users  are  cautioned  to  use  care  when  opening  the  container  because  electrostatic 
charges may cause the filter membrane to move.  The filter membrane can be picked up at the notched side of the 
casing with round-tipped (blunt) forceps. 
 
Storage:  The material should be kept in its original container and stored at temperatures less than 30 °C and away 
from sources of light. 
 
Use:    The  filters  should  be  used  as  received;  the  surface  with  the  deposit  shall  NOT  be  touched  or  brought  into 
contact with implements.  Filters can be used for multiple non-destructive assays; the filter membranes should be 
stored in the Millipore PetriSlide containers after use; the deposit (shiny) side of the filter must face upward.  If a 
filter is partitioned for analysis or not analyzed in whole due to the analytical technique used, a minimum sample 
area of 1 cm2 should be used for analytical determinations to be related to elemental mass loading values provided.  
The value of the total deposit area should be determined for the filter being measured because the deposited area is 
smaller  than  the  filter  area.    The  deposited  area  can  be  determined  directly,  or  the  information  value  for  average 
deposited area in Table 3 may be used. 
 
Blanks:    Blank  filters  are  supplied  to  augment  the  assays  of  the  aerosol  loaded  filters  with  the  determination  of 
analytical  blanks  associated  with  the  filter  matrix.    A  heterogeneous  distribution  of  bromine  in  the  filter  lots 
prevented a value assignment for this element.  A significant amount of chromium and nickel is found by techniques 
that  assay  the  whole  filter,  i.e.,  matrix  and  aerosol  loading  together,  such  as  instrumental  neutron  activation 
analysis (INAA).    Reference  and  information  values  established  for  several  elements  are  listed  in  Table 4  and 
Table 5. 
 
PREPARATION, HOMOGENEITY, AND ANALYSIS 
 
Source  and  Preparation  of  Material:    The  aerosol  material  deposited  on  the  filters  is  intended  to  represent  a 
material of PM2.5 particle size distribution with elemental concentrations typical of those of an urban industrial area.  
A special collection of PM2.5 material for this project from an EPA national monitoring site in Baltimore, MD, had 
yielded  sufficient  contemporary  material [2],  however  controlled  deposit  on  filter  membranes  was  not  achievable 
because of variable retention of ultra-fine particles. Therefore an earlier prepared and successfully tested batch of 
urban particulate matter [3] was used.  This urban dust was collected by the IAEA Laboratories from the air intake 
system  of  the  Vienna  General  Hospital (AKH),  in  Vienna,  Austria.    The  hospital  is  located  in  a  mixed  industrial 
urban  area,  with  several  nearby  major  highways.    The  dust  was  collected  with  vacuum  cleaners  from  the 
electrostatic filters of the hospital air intake ducts.  Approximately 9 kg of material was collected in three batches 
over the period September 1994 to December 1995.  The batches of material were combined and sieved to particle 
sizes below 70 µm to eliminate coarse materials.  The sieved sample was homogenized with a V-shaped blender for 

                                                           

(1)  Certain  commercial  equipment,  instruments  or  materials  are  identified  in  this  certificate  to  adequately  specify  the 
experimental  procedure.    Such  identification  does  not  imply  recommendation  or  endorsement  by  the  National  Institute  of 
Standards and Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the 
purpose.

4 h.    A  portion  of  this  material  was  then  successively  air-jet  milled  three  times  to  obtain  a  more  homogeneous 
distribution  of  smaller  particles  that  simulates  the  respirable  fractions  of  an  urban  aerosol.    The  material  has  a 
median particle size of 3.2 µm and a size range (full width at half maximum) of 2.5 µm.  The air-jet milled material 
was designated IAEA-396a/m.  Small sample analysis studies have demonstrated a high degree of homogeneity for 
this material [4]. 
 
All  preparation  for  the  deposit  on  the  filter  membranes  and  handling  of  the  filters  was  carried  out  in  the  NIST 
Specimen Bank clean room.  Batches of 700 mL to 900 mL each of air particulate matter suspensions were prepared 
by weighing appropriate portions of bulk air particulate matter into 1 L Erlenmeyer flasks, adding the appropriate 
mass of pure water containing a mass fraction of 0.1 % Triton X-100, and placing the flask in an ultra-sonicating 
bath.    A  140 µg/mL  starting  ratio  yielded  a  100 µg/mL  particulate  suspension  for  deposit  after  1 h  of  
ultra-sonication,  followed  by 15 h equilibration and an additional 1 h of ultra-sonication.  During the subsequent 
dispension, the particulate was kept in suspension by vigorous stirring.  Each of these batches was prepared for one 
day of filter preparation (about 150 filters each); a total of 15 batches were prepared yielding 2200 individual filters. 
 
Two Millipore filtration units were used for the preparation.  The filters were Nuclepore polycarbonate membrane 
filters,  0.4 µm  pore  size  (Corning,  Lots 8265024  and 8265025).    After  mounting  the  filters  into  the  filtration 
assembly,  the  filters  were  covered  with  about  40 mL  of  pure  water,  then  5 mL  aliquots  of  the  suspension  were 
pipetted  on  top  with  a  5 mL  adjustable  pipette.    Because  two  staff  members  were  preparing  the  SRM  filters,  the 
pipettes were calibrated to deliver the same volume by mass.  This calibration was controlled before and during the 
preparation of each SRM batch.  After dispension into the filtration apparatus, vacuum was applied and the aerosol 
matter was deposited on the filters.  After filtering to dryness, the filters were removed from the filtration apparatus 
and allowed to air dry under Class 10 clean air flow. 
 
Homogeneity:  The average mass loadings and homogeneity of the deposition procedure for the lot was determined 
by gravimetry using ten preweighed filters per batch and weighing the prepared filters after drying and conditioning.  
The  pooled  relative  standard  deviation  of  this  procedure  was  5.5 %.    Considering  the  difficulties  of  these  mass 
determinations,  the  loaded  filters  were  accepted  as  a  homogeneous  lot.    The  homogeneity  of  elemental  mass 
loadings was determined by INAA on 30 filters, 2 from each batch selected at random.  Twenty elements ranging 
from  several  nanograms  to  tens  of  microgram  amounts  exhibited  a  relative  standard  deviation  attributable  to 
heterogeneity  of  less  than  2.5 %.    The  within-filter  homogeneity  was  determined  from  micro-beam  energy 
dispersive  x-ray  fluorescence (EDXRF)  and  micro-beam  proton-induced  x-ray  emission (PIXE)  data.  
Variances in elemental mass loading not exceeding 4 % relative standard deviation were observed for sampling 
areas  ranging  from  1 mm2  to  30 mm2.    A  sampling  area  of  1 cm2  is  deemed  necessary  for  any  certified  value  in 
Table 1 to be valid within the stated uncertainty. 
 

VALUE ASSIGNMENT 

The analytical techniques used for measurement of each element are listed in Table 6. 

Certified Values:  Certified values are weighted means of results from two or more analytical methods [5].  The 
uncertainty  listed  with  each  value  is  an  expanded  uncertainty,  with  coverage  factor 2  (approximately  95 % 
confidence),  calculated  by  combining  a  between-source  variance  incorporating  inter-method  bias  with  a  pooled 
within-source variance, and a component of variance for material heterogeneity following the ISO Guide [6].

Information  Values  for  Blank  Filters:    Information  values  are  given  for  SRM 2783  blank  filters  to  assist 
users  in  the  determination  of  the  components  of  their  procedural  blank  that  are  from  the  blank  filter  alone.  
Information values are based on results that did not allow complete assessment of Type A and Type B components 
of uncertainty, hence, only an estimated mean without an uncertainty is given for each element.  For all blank filters 
analyzed,  only  elements  for  which  blank  values  were  observed  above  the  detection  limit  of  the  method  used  are 
reported.  These limits of detection are generally lower than 1 % relative of the certified or reference value in the 
loaded filter.
