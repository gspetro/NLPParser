Certificate of Analysis 
 
Standard Reference Material 2791 
 
Inorganic Constituents in Softwood Biomass Material 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended for use in validating methods for the determination of elements 
in softwood biomass materials and similar matrices, and for qualifying in-house control materials.  A unit of SRM 2791 
consists of two bottles each containing approximately 30 g of material. 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values:  Certified mass fraction values of elements in SRM 2791, reported on a dry-mass 
basis, are provided in Table 1.  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its 
accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [1].  Analyses for 
value assignment were performed by NIST.  Certified mass fraction values for elements were calculated as the means 
of the mean values from NIST methods.  The associated uncertainties are expressed at an approximately 95 % level of 
confidence [2–4].   
 
Reference Mass Fraction Values:  Reference mass fraction values for additional elements, reported on a dry-mass 
basis, and ash in SRM 2791, are provided in Tables 2 and 3.  A NIST reference mass fraction value is a noncertified 
value that is the best estimate of the true value based on available data; however, the values do not meet the NIST 
criteria for certification [1] and are provided with an uncertainty that may reflect only measurement reproducibility, 
may not include all sources of uncertainty, or may reflect a lack of sufficient statistical agreement among multiple 
analytical methods.  The reference mass fraction values were derived from results reported by NIST. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 2791 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until  30 June 2028,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  given  in  this 
certificate (see “Instructions for Storage and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, 
or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification: NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Coordination of the technical measurements leading to the certification of this SRM was performed by L.J. Wood and 
R. Oflaz of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division.  
 
Analytical  measurements  at  NIST  were  performed  by  J.F. Browning,  C.E. Bryan,  B.L. Catron,  K.D. Chieh, 
S.E. Long,  A.F. Marlow,  A.J. Moors,  J.M. Ness,  R. Oflaz,  R. Paul,  R.S. Pugh,  and  L.J. Wood  of  the  NIST 
Chemical Sciences Division. 
 
Statistical analysis was provided by J.H. Yen of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division. 
 
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Office  of  Reference 
Materials.

NOTICE AND WARNING TO USERS 
 
SRM 2791 IS INTENDED FOR RESEARCH USE; NOT FOR ANIMAL USE. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE AND USE(1) 
 
Storage:  The SRM should be stored in the original, unopened bottle at room temperature (20 °C to 25 °C) until required 
for use.  The bottle can be closed and test portions removed and analyzed until the material reaches its expiration date. 
 
Use:  Prior to removal of a test portion for analysis, the contents of the bottle should be mixed thoroughly.  Allow the 
contents  to  settle  for  one  minute  prior  to  opening  to  minimize  the  loss  of  fine  particles.    To  relate  analytical 
determinations to the certified values in this Certificate of Analysis, a test portion mass size of at least 0.2 g should be 
used when determining Ag, Al, As, Ca, Cd, Ce, Cl, Co, Cr, Cs, Fe, K, La, Mg, Mn, Na, Rb, Sb, Sc, Se, Sm, Th, Ti, 
V, W and Zn; a test portion mass size of at least 0.25 g should be used when determining Hg; a test portion mass size 
of at least 0.5 g should be used when determining Cu; and a test portion mass size of at least 1 g should be used when 
determining B, C, and I.  Test portions should be analyzed as received and results converted to a dry-mass basis (See 
“Determination  of  Moisture”).    Analytical  results  obtained  in  analyses  should  include  their  own  estimates  of 
uncertainty and can be compared to the listed values using procedures described in references 5 and 6. 
 
Determination of Moisture:  Moisture content of SRM 2791 was determined at NIST by (1) freeze-drying to constant 
mass over 7 d; (2) drying over magnesium perchlorate in a desiccator at room temperature for 7 d; and (3) drying 
using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) (LECO Model 701) for 2 h held at 105 °C.  Unweighted results obtained 
using all three techniques were averaged to determine a conversion factor of (0.9489 ± 0.0065) gram dry-mass per 
gram as-received mass, which was used to convert data from an as-received to a dry-mass basis; the uncertainty shown 
on this value is an expanded uncertainty (k = 2) to represent a 95 % level of confidence.  An uncertainty component 
for the conversion factor (0.34 %) obtained from the moisture measurements is incorporated in the uncertainties of 
the certified and reference values, reported on a dry-mass basis, that are provided in this certificate. 
 
ANALYSIS 
SOURCE, PREPARATION, AND ANALYSIS 
 

 

Preparation:  SRM 2791 was prepared from softwood bedding pellets to support biomass energy, biomass technology 
developments, and environmental impact assessments.  The material was purchased commercially as five 1 ft3 bags 
that were sent to the NIST Reference Material Production facility (ISO certified Class 7 clean room) in Charleston, SC.  
The material was first cryomilled and then cryohomogenized.  The material was shipped to NIST Gaithersburg for jet 
milling, irradiation (Neutron Products, Inc., Dickerson, MD) to an absorbed dose of 7.9 kGy to 9.5 kGy, and bottling.   
 
Particle Size Measurements:  Particle size measurements for SRM 2791 were made after packaging using a Malvern 
Mastersizer 3000 laser-based light scattering system. Approximately 0.5 g of SRM 2791 m3aterial was measured using 
ethanol as the dispersant (refractive index 1.36). The sample  was introduced into the  measurement cell before ten 
individual measurements were made at an obscuration of 12 % to 13 % of the laser beam. The calculated 10th (Dv10), 
50th (Dv50) and 90th (Dv90) percentile particle sizes are Dv10 = 6.93 µm, Dv50 = 32.4 µm, and Dv90 = 112 µm. The 
volume fraction of material smaller than 75.1 µm in diameter is approximately 79 %. 
 
NIST Analytical Approach for Determination of Elements:  Value assignment of the mass fractions of elements 
in SRM 2791 was based on the combination of measurements provided by NIST using inductively coupled plasma 
mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), isotope dilution 
cold vapor inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ID/CV ICP-MS), instrumental neutron activation analysis 
(INAA), and thermal neutron prompt gamma-ray activation analysis (PGAA).   
 
NIST Analyses for As, Cr, Co, Cs, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Se, V, and Zn using ICP-MS and ICP-OES:  Mass fractions 
of arsenic, cesium, chromium, cobalt, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, potassium, selenium, sodium, vanadium, 
and zinc were determined by either ICP-MS or ICP-OES in duplicate, 0.5 g, test portions taken from each of six bottles 
of  SRM 2791.    Samples  were  digested  in  a  microwave  sample  preparation  system  using  a  HNO3:HF  solution.  
Quantification was based on the method of standard additions using calibration solutions prepared from the SRM 3100 
series of single-element standard solutions. 
 
NIST Analyses for Hg using ID/CV ICP-MS: The mass fraction of  mercury  was determined by ID/CV ICP-MS in 
single,  nominal  0.25 g,  test  portions  taken  from  each  of  eight  bottles  of  SRM 2791.    Samples  were  digested  in  a

(1)  Certain  commercial  equipment,  instruments  or  materials  are  identified  in  this  certificate  to  adequately  specify  the 
experimental procedure.  Such identification does not imply recommendation or endorsement by the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the purpose.

microwave  sample  preparation  system  using  a  HNO3:HCl  solution.    Measurements  were  made  using  cold-vapor 
mercury generation coupled with ICP-MS.  Quantification was based on reverse isotope dilution with a 201Hg stock 
solution and SRM 1641d Mercury in Water. 
 
NIST Analyses for Ag, Al, As, Ca, Cd, Ce, Cl, Co, Cr, Cs, Fe, K, La, Mg, Mn, Na, Rb, Sb, Sc, Se, Sm, Th, Ti, V, W, and  
Zn  using  INAA:  Mass  fractions  of  aluminum,  antimony,  arsenic,  calcium,  cadmium,  cerium,  cesium,  chlorine, 
chromium, cobalt, iron, lanthanum,  magnesium,  manganese, potassium, rubidium, samarium,  scandium, selenium, 
silver, sodium, thorium, titanium, tungsten, vanadium, and zinc were determined by INAA using duplicate, nominal 
0.2 g, test portions taken from each of 12 bottles of SRM 2791.  For the analysis of antimony, arsenic, cadmium, 
cerium,  cesium,  chromium,  cobalt,  iron,  lanthanum,  rubidium,  samarium,  scandium,  selenium,  silver,  thorium, 
tungsten, and zinc, powders were pressed into cylindrical pellets, and samples, standards, and controls were packaged 
individually in clean polyethylene bags and irradiated individually at 20 MW for 16 h with a 180-degree inversion 
after 8 h.  Nuclides were counted for 24 h after a 14 d decay (Ag, Ce, Co, Cr, Cs, Fe, Rb, Sb, Sc, Se, Th, Zn) or 2 h 
after  a  5 d  decay  (As,  Cd,  La,  Sm,  W).      For  analysis  of  aluminum,  calcium,  chlorine,  magnesium,  manganese, 
potassium, sodium, titanium, and vanadium, each sample, standard, or control material was individually irradiated 
together with one flux monitor foil for 120 s at a reactor power of 20 MW.  Nuclides were counted for 5 min to 30 min 
after  decays  of  5 min  to  15 min.    Quantification  is  based  on  validated  pure  metal  foils,  pure  compounds,  or  the 
SRM 3100 series of single-element standard solutions. 
 
NIST Analyses for B,  C, and H using PGAA: Mass  fractions of boron, carbon, and hydrogen  were determined by 
PGAA using single, nominal 1 g, test portions taken from each of eight bottles of SRM 2791.  Samples were irradiated 
for 6 h to 24 h.  Gamma rays were measured using a reverse electrode high purity germanium detector.  The 2223 keV, 
477 keV,  and  4945 keV  peaks  were  integrated  for  hydrogen,  boron,  and  carbon, respectively.    Quantification  was 
based on SRM 912 Urea and SRM 3107 Boron (B) Standard Solution (Lot # 110830). 
 
NIST Analytical Approach for Determination of Ash:  Value assignment of the mass fraction of ash in SRM 2791 
was based on the measurements provided by NIST using TGA.  Nominal 1 g samples were held for 3 h held at 575 °C. 
 
Homogeneity Assessment:  To address issues of possible inhomogeneity of the SRM, analyses of variance with a 
5 % significance level and graphical analyses were performed on NIST data.  For ash, Ca, Fe, and La, the uncertainty 
incorporates a component for possible inhomogeneity based on the standard deviation.   
 
Value Assignment:  Each certified mass fraction value in this SRM was derived from results of analyses performed 
by NIST using the mean of the mean values from NIST results.  The uncertainty of the combined mean was estimated 
using a bootstrap procedure based on a Gaussian random effects model for the between-method effects [2-4].

Certified Mass Fraction Values:  Each certified mass fraction value is the combined mean from each set of analyses 
by NIST.  Values are expressed as x ± U95%(x), where x is the certified value and U95%(x) is the expanded uncertainty 
of  the  certified  value.    The  true  value  of  the  analyte  is  believed  to  lie  within  the  interval  x ± U95%(x)  with  95 % 
confidence.  To propagate this uncertainty, treat the certified value as a normally distributed random variable with 
mean x and standard deviation U95%(x)/2 [2–4].  The measurand is the total mass fraction for each analyte listed in 
Table 1,  on  a  dry-mass  basis.    Metrological  traceability  is  to  the  SI  derived  unit  for  mass  fraction  (expressed  as 
milligrams per kilogram).
