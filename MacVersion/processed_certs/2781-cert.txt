Values: 

 
This  Standard  Reference  Material  (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  use  in  the  evaluation  of  methods  used  for  the 
analysis of sludges and other materials of a similar matrix.  Certified values are provided for elements.  Reference 
values are provided for elements, synthetic polycyclic musks, and perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) as Perfluorinated 
Alkyl Acids (PFAAs) and Hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDs).  Information values are provided for PFAAs.  SRM 
2781  is  a  dried,  pulverized  domestic  sludge.    A  unit  of  SRM  2781  consists  of  a  bottle  containing  40  g  of  dried, 
pulverized domestic sludge. 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values:  The certified mass fraction values for elements are listed in Table 1; analytical 
confidence  in  its 
methods are provided in Table 7.  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its 
count 
The 
accuracy  in  that  all  known  or  suspected  sources  of  bias  have  been  investigated  or  taken  into  account  [1].    The 
SI  unit  for 
measurands are the certified mass fractions listed in Table 1 and are metrologically traceable to the SI unit for mass 
expressed as percentages or as milligrams per kilogram, as indicated in the table. 
 
Reference  Mass  Fraction  Values:    Reference  mass  fraction  values  for  elemental  and  organic  constituents  are 
provided in Tables 2 through Table 5; analytical methods are provided in at the end in Table 7.  Reference values are 
noncertified values that are the best estimate of the true values based on available data.  The values do not meet NIST 
criteria  for  certification  and  are  provided  with  associated  uncertainties  that  may  reflect  only  measurement 
reproducibility, may not include all sources of uncertainty, or may reflect a lack of sufficient statistical agreement 
among  multiple  analytical  methods  [1].    The  measurands  are  the  mass  fractions  listed  in  Tables  2  through  5  as 
determined by the methods indicated and are metrologically traceable to the SI unit for mass fraction expressed as 
percentages or as micrograms per kilogram, as indicated in the tables.  
 
Information  Mass  Fraction  Values:    Information  mass  fraction  values  for  organic  constituents  are  provided  in 
Table 6.  An information value is considered to be a value that will be of interest to the SRM user, but insufficient 
information is available to assess the uncertainty associated with the value or only a limited number of analyses were 
performed [1].  Information values may not be used to assess metrological traceability. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 2781 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until  31  August  2025,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  given  in  this 
certificate (see “Instructions for Storage and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, 
or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Overall  direction  and  coordination  of  technical  measurements  for  the  original  characterization  of  this  SRM  was 
performed  by  J.D.  Fassett  of  the  NIST  Chemical  Sciences  Division.    Coordination  and  certification  of  additional 
elements  and  organic  constituents  were  performed  by  J.L.  Reiner  of  the  NIST  Chemical  Sciences  Division  and 
D.J. O’Kelly formerly of NIST.  
 
Statistical consultation was provided by L.M. Gill and N.A. Heckert of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE AND USE 
 
Storage:  SRM 2781 must be stored in its original bottle at temperatures less than 30 °C. 
 
Use:    A  minimum  sample  mass  of  100  mg  (dry  mass;  see  “Instructions  for  Drying”)  should  be  used  and  sample 
preparation procedures should be designed to effect complete dissolution for analytical determinations to be related 
to the certified values provided.  
 
Instructions for Drying:  When nonvolatile elements are to be determined, samples should be vacuum dried at room 
temperature for 24 h or oven dried for 2 h at 110 °C.  Volatile elements (e.g., arsenic, mercury, and selenium) and 
organic constituents should be determined on samples as received; separate samples should be dried according to these 
instructions to obtain a correction factor for moisture.  Moisture corrections are then made to measurement values 
before comparing them to the certified values.  [Note that the mass loss on drying at the time of certification was found 
to be in the range of 4.7 % to 6.6 % when using the recommended drying procedures.] 
 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Source  and  Preparation  of  Material:    The  U.S.  Geological  Survey  (USGS),  under  contract  to  NIST,  obtained 
partially  dehydrated  sewage  cake  material  from  the  Metropolitan  Denver  Sewage  Disposal  District  No.  1.    The 
material  (approximately  182  kg)  was  placed  in  plastic-lined  drums  and  transported  to  the  USGS  facilities 
(Lakewood, CO) for processing.  It was dried at ambient temperature in a forced air chamber, ground to pass a 74 µm 
(200 mesh) sieve, blended for 24 h to assure homogeneity of the pulverized material.  Test samples were taken from 
the blender for preliminary homogeneity analyses.  The material was then radiation sterilized.  The sterilized material 
was shipped in bulk to NIST, where the material was bottled in 40 g units after reblending for 4 h. 
 
Analysis:  The homogeneity was assessed at USGS on 10 replicate samples of bulk material for over 40 elements 
using  x-ray  fluorescence  (XRF)  and/or  inductively  coupled  plasma  atomic  emission  spectrometry  (ICP-AES).  
Homogeneity  was  further  assessed  during  certification  analysis.    At  sample  sizes  of  100  mg  or  greater,  no 
sample-to-sample variations in excess of those expected from the analytical measurements performed at USGS were 
detected. 
 
Value Assignment:  Analyses for value assignment were performed by NIST and collaborating laboratories where 
appropriate.  Values were reported on a dry-mass basis in mass fraction units and are based on measurements using a 
sample mass of at least 100 mg.  Analytical methods are provided in Table 7.

(a) The  certified  mass  fraction  value  is  a  weighted  mean  of  the  mass  fractions  determined  by  the  methods  indicated  for  each 
analyte [1].  The uncertainty listed with each value is an expanded uncertainty about the mean [1,2], with coverage factor, k, 
based on the t-interval where the degrees of freedom is the number of methods minus one and calculated by combining a pooled 
within-method variance with a between-method variance [3] following the ISO/JCGM Guide [4,5].  The certified values are 
reported on a dry-mass basis.  For certified values to be valid, the material must be dried according to the instructions provided 
above. 

(b) The  certified  mass  fraction  value  is  a  weighted  mean  of  the  mass  fractions  determined  by  the  methods  indicated  for  each 
analyte [1].  The expanded uncertainty is the half-width of a symmetric 95 % parametric bootstrap confidence interval [6], which 
is consistent with the ISO/JCGM Guide [4,5].  The effective coverage factor, k, is 2.  The certified values are reported on a 
dry-mass basis.  For certified values to be valid, the material must be dried according to the instructions provided above. 

 
 
Reference Mass Fraction Values:  Each reference mass fraction value, expressed as a mass fraction on a dry-mass 
basis, is an equally weighted mean of results provided by NIST and/or collaborating laboratories.

APPENDIX A 
 
Leachable Mass Fractions Using U.S. EPA and NJDEP Methods for Flame Atomic  
Absorption Spectrometry and Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometry 

 
To obtain total mass fractions, either subsamples of the SRM must be completely decomposed, or the sample must be 
analyzed directly in its solid form.  For mixed acid dissolution, hydrofluoric acid must be included in the acid mixture 
to totally dissolve siliceous material present in sludge. 
 
For a number of environmental monitoring purposes, acid extractable mass fractions of elements are often used rather 
than total mass fractions.  Acid extractable methods do not necessarily result in total decomposition of the sludge.  It 
should be noted that results obtained using acid leach conditions are often depicted in reports as total results.  However, 
reported acid labile or extractable mass fractions of elements are generally lower than total mass fractions.  Results 
are often presented as measured mass fractions in the leachate in comparison to the total or certified mass fractions.  
The recovery of an element as a percent of total is a function of several factors such as the mode of occurrence in the 
sample, leach medium, leach time, temperature conditions, and pH of the sample-leach medium mixture [7].  
 
In its monitoring programs, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) has established a number of leach 
methods, such as Methods 3015, 3050, and 3051 [8,9] for the determination of acid labile or extractable mass fractions 
of  elements.    The  New  Jersey  Department  of  the  Environment  (NJDEP)  has  developed  its  own  leach  method, 
NJDEP 100 for state use [10].  The NJDEP and the U.S. EPA prepared samples of SRM 2781 using the NJDEP 100 
method and EPA Methods 3050 and 3051 and analyzed the resulting leachates by FAAS and ICP-AES. 
 
Reference values have been established for the acid-leachable mass fractions of several elements in SRM 2781.  These 
values  are  the  means  of  all  results  from  the  different  leach  measurement  methods  and  combinations  used.    The 
reference values are listed in Table A1, along with their uncertainties which are based on 95 % confidence intervals 
of  the  means  of  results.    For  some  of  the  elements  (copper,  iron,  silver,  vanadium),  no  statistically  significant 
differences were found among results from the two laboratories using three or four combinations of sample preparation 
and instrumental measurement techniques (NJDEP 100 - FAAS; NJDEP 100 - ICP-AES; EPA 3050 - ICP-AES; EPA 
3051 - ICP-AES).  For all other elements, statistically significant between-laboratory differences were identified and 
are  included  in  the  stated  uncertainties.    These  differences  are  small  in  comparison  to  control  limits  for  many 
environmental monitoring programs.  Therefore, the reference values are meaningful, despite the between-laboratory 
differences found. 
 
Reference Values:  The reference values given in Table A1 are not NIST certified but are provided as a reference for 
U.S. EPA 3050 and 3051, and NJDEP 100 methods.  The uncertainties are based on a 95 % confidence interval for 
the mean and include an allowance for differences between the analytical methods used.
