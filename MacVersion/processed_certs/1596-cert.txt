Standard  Reference  Material  1596 
Dinitropyrene  Isomers  and  1-Nitropyrene  in  Methylene  Chloride 

This  Standard  Reference  Material  (SRM)  consists  of  five  vials,  each  containing  approximately  13  mL  of  a  methylene 
chloride  solution  of  four  nitrated  polycyclic  aromatic  hydrocarbons  (N-PAH):  1-nitropyrene,  1,3-dinitropyrene,  1,6- 
dinitropyrene,  and  1,8-dinitropyrene.  SRM  1596  is  intended  primarily  for  use  in  calibrating  chromatographic  in- 
strumentation  used  for  the  determination  of  N-PAH. 

Certified  Concentrations  of  Nitro-PAH: 
Certified  concentrations  of  the  four  N-PAH  in  SRM  1596  are  given  in  Table  1.  The  concentration  values  are  certified 
in  g/g  units  but  are  also  reported  in  pg/mL  for  user  convenience.  The  certified  values  in  Table  1  are  derived  from 
the  concordant  results  obtained  from  high-performance  liquid  chromatography  (HPLC)  and  gas  chromatography/mass 
spectrometry  (GC/MS).  The  N-PAH  used  in  the  preparation  and  certification  of  this  SRM  were  obtained  from  Mid- 
west  Research  Institute,  Kansas  City,  MO.  Compound  purities  were  determined  at  Midwest  Research  Institute.  Each 
compound  was  at  least  99  percent  pure  and,  therefore,  no  correction  was  made  for  purity. 
NOTICE  AND  WARNINGS  TO  USERS 

, 

Expiration  of  Certification:  This  certification  is  valid,  within  the  limits  certified,  for  one  year  from  the  date  of  ship- 
ment  from  NBS. 
NBS. 

In  the  event  that  the  certification  should  become  invalid  before  then,  purchasers  will  be  notified  by 

Storage:  Sealed  ampoules,  as  received,  must  be  stored  in  the  dark  at  temperatures  between  -25  and  0  °C, 
Use:  Prior  to  use,  samples  for  analysis  should  be  brought  to  room  temperature  and  equilibrated  for  one  hour.  Cer- 
tified  values  are  not  applicable  for  ampoules  stored  after  opening,  even  if  resealed.  Aliquots  should  be  withdrawn 
from  the  ampoules  immediately  after  opening  and  processed  without  delay  for  the  certified  values  in  Table  1  to  be 
valid  within  the  stated  uncertainty.  However,  if  this  is  impossible  or  impractical,  we  recommend  that  after  aliquots  are 
removed  from  the  ampoules,  the  solution  should  be  transferred  to  amber  containers  and  sealed  with  Teflon-lined 
septa. 

CAUTION:  The  toxicity  or  carcinogenicity/mutagenicity  of  the  N-PAH  in  this  SRM  has  not  been  defined  precisely; 
however,  this  material  should  be  treated  as  a  potential  health  hazard. 

Preparation  and  analytical  determinations  for  this  standard  were  performed  in  the  Organic  Analytical  Research 
Division,  Center  for  Analytical  Chemistry,  by  L.  C.  Sander  and  L.  R.  Hilpert. 

Consultation  on  the  statistical  design  of  the  experimental  work  was  provided  by  R.  C.  Paule  of  the  National  Measure- 
ment  Laboratory. 

The  coordination  of  the  technical  measurements  leading  to  certification  were  performed  under  the  direction  of  S.  A. 
Wise  and  W.  E.  May.

Office  of  Standard  Reference  Materials 

The  technical  and  support  aspects  involved  in  the  preparation,  certification,  and  issuance  of  this  Standard  Reference 
Material  were  coordinated  through  the  Office  of  Standard  Reference  Materials  by  R.  Alvarez. 

Preparation  and  Analysis 
The  solution  of  four  N-PAH  in  methylene  chloride  was  prepared  and  ampouled  in  the  NBS  Toxic  Chemicals  Han- 
dling  Facility.  SRM  1596  was  prepared  from  a  mixture  of  three  dinitropyrene  isomers;  1-nitropyrene  was  added  as  an 
individual  component.  An  electrobalance  was  used  for  the  determination  of  the  mass  of  dinitropyrene  isomer  mixture 
and  i-nitropyrene. 
Each  of  the  solids  was  weighed  into  gold  foil  weighing  boats,  and  transferred  into  a  4000-mL 
volumetric  flask  previously  filled  with  argon  and  methylene  chloride  was  added  and  the  solution  weighed.  Aliquots 
(1.3  mL)  of  dinitropyrene  solution  were  placed  in  2-mL  amber  ampoules.  The  ampoules  were  filled  with  argon  just 
prior  to  flame  sealing. 

A  stratified  random  sampling  scheme  was  used  to  obtain  a  representative  cross  section  of  the  ampouled  solution  for 
analyses.  A  total  of  eighteen  ampoules  were  analyzed  by  HPLC  and  GC/MS.  Sample  homogeneity  was  determined 
based  on  the  HPLC  measurements.  No  evidence  of  sample  heterogeneity  was  observed. 

HPLC  Analysis 
In  total,  ten  ampoules  were  analyzed  in  duplicate  by  HPLC.  Propylbenzene  was  used  as  an  internal  standard  for  the 
determinations.  Aliquots  (500  LL)  of  the  N-PAH  SRM  solution  were  mixed  with  500  »L  of  a  methylene  chloride 
solution  containing  propylbenzene.  Aliquots  (20  »L)  of  the  internal  standard  fortified  N-PAH  SRM  solution  were 
chromatographed  using  a  monomeric  Cig  (25  cm  x  4.6  mm,  5  ym  particle  size)  column  with  ultraviolet  detection  at 
235  nm.  The  separation  was  accomplished  using  isocratic  elution  (75:25  methanol:water)  at  a  flow  rate  of  20  yL/min, 
at  ambient  temperature.  Analyte  concentrations  were  determined  from  peak  areas  of  the  analyte  and  internal  stand- 
ard,  based  on  response  factors  determined  from  analyses  of  a  gravimetrically  prepared  solution  of  the  analytes. 
A 
chromatogram  demonstrating  the  separation  of  the  compounds  in  this  SRM  is  shown  in  Figure  1. 

GC/MS  Analysis 
GC/MS  measurements  were  made  using  selected  ion  monitoring  detection  (SIM)  under  methane  negative  ion  chemi- 
cal  ionization  (NICI)  conditions.  Deuterated  dinitropyrenes  were  used  as  internal  standards  for  quantitation.  One  (1) 
mL  aliquots  of  the  N-PAH  SRM  solution  were  mixed  with  1.0  mL  of  a  solution  containing  1-nitropyrene-do,  1,3- 
dinitropyrene-dg,  1,6-dinitropyrene-dg,  and  1,8-dinitropyrene-dg.  Aliquots  (2.0  L)  of  the  internal  standard  fortified 
SRM<  solutions  were  injected  onto  a  30  m  x  0.25  mm  id.  fused  silica  capillary  column  coated  with  a  0.25  ym  film  of  a 
non-polar  methyl  silicone  bonded  liquid  phase.  The  molecular  ions  for  the  analytes  and  deuterated  internal  standards 
were  monitored  with  a  dwell  time  of  200  ms  for  each  ion.  Figure  2  shows  a  representative  GC/MS  SIM  analysis  of  the 
N-PAH  SRM < 
Concentrations  of  the  analytes  were  determined  from  the  analyte  peak  areas,  the  internal 
standard  peak  areas,  and  response  factors  determined  from  analyses  of  gravimetrically  prepared  solutions  of  the 
analytes  and  internal  standards.

a  The  certified  values  and  associated  uncertainties  were  derived  from  the  weighted  combination  of  HPLC  and  GC/MS  data  as  described  by  Paule 
and  Mandel  in  "Consensus  Values  and  Weighting  Factors,"  Journal  of  Research  of  the  National  Bureau  of  Standards,  Vol  87,  No.  5,  Sept-Oct 
(1982),  pp  377-385.

uncertainties  apply  only  at  20  °C  (density  1.326  g/mL).  A  concentration  change  of  less  than  1%  will  occur  for  a  5  °C  temperature  change.
