‘The  certified  value  listed  for  a  constituent  is  the  present  best  estimate  of  the  "true"  value.  The  certified  values  are  given  as  the  oxide  on  an 

equivalent  weight  basis  and  assume  stoichiometry  in  the  form  of  compounds  listed. 

“The  estimated  uncertainty  listed  for  a  constituent  is  based  on  judgment  and  represents  an  evaluation  of  the  combined  effects  of  method  im- 

precision,  possible  systematic  errors  among  methods,  and  material  variability  for  samples  1.0  g  or  more.  No  attempt  was  made.to  derive  exact 
Statistical  measures  of  imprecision.

PLANNING,  PREPARATION,  TESTING,  AND  ANALYSIS: 

The  base  material  for  this  SRM  is  from  the  Darling  Range,  Australia.  It  was  provided  by  Alcoa  of  Australia  through  the 
courtesy  of  B.M.  Scott,  Kwinana,  Australia,  and  R.A.  Kramer,  Alcoa,  U.S.A. 

Homogeneity  testing  was  performed  at  NIST  by  G.A.  Sleater,  using  x-ray  fluorescence,  in  the  Gas  and  Particulate  Science 
Division,  Center  for  Analytical  Chemistry. 

Cooperative  analyses  for  certification  were  performed  in  the  following  laboratories: 

*  Alcan  International,  Arvida  Research  &  Development  Centre,  Quebec,  Canada,  F.M.  Kimmerle. 
*  Aluminum  Company  of  America,  Alcoa  Center,  Pennsylvania,  J.L.  Genna. 
*  Chemistry  Centre  (WA)  Perth,  Western  Australia,  M.B.  Costello. 
*Comalco  Research  Centre,  Thomastown,  Victoria,  Australia,  T.  Hamilton. 
*  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology,  Gaithersburg,  Maryland,  G.A.  Sleater,  W.R.  Kelly  and  K.E.  Murphy. 
*Reynolds  Aluminum,  Reynolds  Mctal  Company,  Richmond,  Virginia,  C.D.  Davis. 

The  overall  coordination  of  the  technical  measurements  leading  to  certification  was  performed  under  the  direction  of  JI. 
Shultz,  Research  Associate,  ASTM-NIST  Research  Associate  Program. 

The  original  technical  and  support  aspects  involved  in  the  preparation,  certification,  and  issuance  of  this  Standard  Reference 
Material  were  coordinated  through  the  Standard  Reference  Materials  Program  by  R.  Alvarez  and  W.P.  Reed. 

The  update  and  revision  of  this  Certificate  of  Analysis  was  coordinated  through  the  Standard  Reference  Materials  Program 
by  T.  E.  Gills.
