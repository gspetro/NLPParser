Certificate of Analysis 
 
Standard Reference Material 1549a 
 
Whole Milk Powder 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended primarily for evaluation of methods for determining proximates, 
fatty acids, cholesterol, vitamins, elements, and amino acids in whole milk powder and similar materials.  This SRM 
can also be used for quality assurance when assigning valu es to in -house reference materials.  The  SRM is a whole 
milk powder prepared by a commercial manufacturer.  A unit of SRM  1549a consists of five heat-sealed aluminized 
packets, each containing approximately 10 g of material. 
 
Certified  Mass Fraction   Values:   Certified  mass fraction   values  for  cholesterol,  elements,  and  vitamins  in 
SRM 1549a, reported on an as-received basis, are provided in Tables 1 through 3.  A NIST certified value is a value 
for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that a ll known or suspected sources of bias have been 
taken into account  [1].  Analyses for value assignment s  were performed by NIST   and collaborating laboratori es.  
Certified values  were calculated as the mean of the me an value s from NIST methods  and the median of the  mean 
results provided by collaborating laboratories , where  appropriate.  The associated uncertainties are expressed  at an 
approximately 95 % level of confidence [2–4]. 
 
Reference  Mass Fraction   Values:   Reference  mass fraction   values  for additional elements ,  additional vitamins, 
choline, carnitine, proximates, fatty acids, calories, and amino acids in SRM 1549a, reported on an as-received basis, 
are provided in Tables 4 through 8.  A NIST reference value is a noncertified value that is the best estimate of the true 
value based on available data; however, the value does not meet the  NIST criteria for certification [1] and is provided 
with an uncertainty that may reflect only measurement reproducibility, may not include all sources of uncertainty, or 
may reflect a lack of sufficient statistical agreement among multiple analy tical methods.  The reference mass fraction 
values were derived from results reported by NIST and/or collaborating laboratories. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 1549a is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until 01 July 2025, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given in this certificate 
(see “ Instructions for Storage   and Use ”).   The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contam inated, or 
otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If  substantive 
technical changes occur that affect the certification before the e
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Coordination of the technical measurements leading to the certification of this SRM was performed by M.M. Phillips 
and L.J. Wood of the NIST  Chemical Sciences Division, K.E. Sharpless of the NIST Special Programs Office,  and 
S. Ehling of the Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA, Washington, DC). 
 
Support for assignment of values for  vitamin D3 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 was provided by  the National Institutes 
of Health, Office of Dietary  Supplements (NIH-ODS).  Technical consultation was provided by J.M.
 Betz (NIH -
ODS). 
 
Statistical analysis was provided by J.H. Yen of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division. 
 
Support aspects involved in the issuance of this SRM were coordinated through t
Materials.

NOTICE AND WARNING TO USERS   
 
SRM 1549a IS INTENDED FOR RESEARCH USE; NOT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE AND USE 
 
Storage:  The SRM should be stored under refrigeration (2 °C to 8 °C) in the original unopened packets.  For elemental 
analyses, the packet can be  opened, test portions removed and analyzed, then the packet  resealed until the material 
reaches its expiration date.  For organic analyses, the packet can be resea
portions removed and analyzed for three weeks after the packet was initially opened. 
 
Use:  Before use, a packet should be allowed to warm to room temperature, and the  contents of the  packet should be 
mixed thoroughly by shaking the packet.  Allow the contents to settle for one minute prior to opening to minimize the 
loss of fine particles.  For certified values to be valid, test
 portion size should be  based on descriptions below  (See 
“Source, Preparation, and Analysis”).  Results obtained in analyses should include their own estimates of uncertainty 
and can be compared to the certified values using procedures described in referenc e 5. 
 
SOURCE, PREPARATION, AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Source and Preparation:    The SRM is a whole milk powder.   The contents of six bags, each  containing 27 kg of 
powdered whole milk, were blended and packaged by High-Purity Standards (Charleston, SC).  The milk powder was 
sealed in approximately 10 g aliquots in Mylar bags that had been flushed with nitrogen. 
 
Analytical Approach for Determinati on of Cholesterol:    Value assignment of the cholesterol mass fraction was 
based on measurements made by NIST using a method based on isotope dilution (ID) gas chromatography (GC) with 
mass spectrometry (MS). 
 
NIST Analyses for Cholesterol:    The mass  fraction of cholesterol was measured using the 
ID-GC-MS  method 
developed at NIST for serum cholesterol [6] and modified for the determination of cholesterol in food matrices u sing 
AOAC International Official Method 996.06 for hydrolysis [7].  Three sets of samples were prepared, each consisting 
of triplicate 0.5 g test portions from each of  three packets of SRM 1549a weighed into screw-capped test tubes.  An 
-13C3, was added  to each  tube.  
aliquot of a solution containing a known mass of the internal standard, cholesterol
Cholesterol esters were hydrolyzed by heating the samples in an alcohol-KOH solution for 1 h at 100 °C.  Cholesterol 
was extracted into hexane, and a portion of the hexane extract was evapora

performed using  a 30  m (phenyl/methyl polysiloxane, 5/95  mole fraction) non -polar fused silica column directly 
interfaced to the ion source.  Cholesterol was determined in the electron ionization mode with selected ion monitoring 
-TMS, respectively.    Calibrants were prepared 
at  m/z 458 and  m/z 461 for the unlabeled and labeled cholesterol
gravimetrically, from SRM 911c Cholesterol, at levels intended to approximate the level of the cholesterol in the SRM 
following extraction.  A single internal standard solution  was used for the calibrants and samples.  Calculations are 
based on linear regression analysis for the calibrants.

Analytical Approach for  Determination of Elements:   Value assignment of the mass fractions of the elements in 
SRM 1549a  was based on the combination of measurements provided by  NIST  using  inductively coupled plasma 
optical emission spectrometry  (ICP-OES), inductively coupled plas ma mass spectrometry  (ICP-MS), instrumental 
neutron activation analysis (INAA), and provided by collaborating laboratories, where appropriate.   
 
NIST Analyses for  Ba, Ca, Cu, Fe, I, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, P, Sr, and Zn 
fractions of barium, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, 
ICP-OES.  Mass fractions of barium, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, and strontium were measured by 
ICP-MS.    For each technique, d uplicate  0.5 g test portions   were  taken from each of 10  packets of SRM  1549a.  
Samples were digested 
-plate 
digestion using nitric acid, a nitric acid/hydrofluoric acid mixture, or a  nitric acid/perchloric acid mixture.  The mass 
fraction of iodine was measured by ICP-MS in single 0.3 g test portions taken from each of six packets and in each of 
four packets a year later.  Samples were digested in aqueous tetramethylammoni um hydroxide using a microwave 
sample preparation system.   Quantitation for  all elements was based on the method of standard additions  using the 
SRM 3100 series single element standard solutions. 
 
NIST Analyses for Se and Zn by INAA:  The mass fractions of selenium and zinc were measured by INAA in duplicate 
0.22 g test portions taken from each of six packets of SRM 1549a.  Powders were pressed into cylindrical pellets, and 
samples, standards, and controls were packaged individually in clean polyethylene bags and irradiated individually at 
20 MW.  Samples, controls, and standards, prepared from SRM  3100 series  single element standard solutions, were 
irradiated for 4  h.  Irradiation capsules were then inverted  180 degrees, and materials were irradiated another 4  h.  
Selenium and zinc were counted for 8 h after a decay of more than 90 d. 
 
Analytical Approach for Determination of Vitamins:   Value assignment of the mass fractions of the vitamins in 
SRM 1549a  was based on the combination of results provided
  from  various  analytical methods at NIST   and 
collaborating laboratories, where appropriate .  NIST provided measurements by using  liquid chromatography (LC) 
with or without ID and MS or tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). 
 
NIST Analyses for Riboflavin, Niacinamide, Pantothenic Acid, Pyridoxamine, and Pyridoxal by LC-MS or ID-LC-MS:  
The mass fraction of riboflavin was measured by LC-MS in duplicate 2.5 g test portions taken from each of 10 packets 
of SRM 1549a.  Mass fractions of niacinamide, pantothenic acid, pyridoxamine, and pyridoxal were measured by ID-
2H4-niacinamide, 
LC-MS  in duplicate 2.5  g test portions taken from each of 10
13C3,15N-pantothenic acid, 2H3-pyridoxamine, and 2H3-pyridoxal were added as internal standards.   The analytes and 
internal standards were extracted into dilute acetic acid for analysis by positive ion mode LC-MS.  A gradient method 
with an ammonium formate buffer/methanol mobile phase and a  C18 column were used for LC-MS determination of 
the vitamins.   Niacinamide and  2H4-niacinamide were measured at  m/z 123 and m/z 127, respectively.   Pantothenic 
13C3,15N-pantothenic acid  were measured at  m/z 220  and  m/z 224, respectively.   Pyridoxamine and 
acid and 
2H3-pyridoxamine were measured at m/z 169 and m/z 172, respectively.  Pyridoxal and 2H3-pyridoxal were measured 
at  m/z 168  and  m/z 171, res pectively.   Riboflavin was measured at  m/z 377,  using  13C3,15N-pantothenic acid as an 
internal standard.  Calibrants were prepared gravimetrically at levels intended to approximate the levels of the vitamins 
in the SRM following extraction.  The purity of neat calibrant materials was determined at NIST using LC-absorbance, 
Karl Fischer titration, thermogravime
spectroscopy (q1HNMR), and differential scanning  calorimetry (DSC).  A single internal standard solution was used 
for the calibrants and samples.

Choline  and  2H9-choline  were measured at  m/z 104  and  m/z 113, respectively.   Carnitine  and  2H9-carnitine  were 
measured at  m/z 162  and  m/z 171, respectively.   Calibrants were prepared gravimetrically, at levels intended to 
approximate the levels of the vitamins in the SRM followi ng extraction.   The purity of  neat calibrant materials was 
determined at NIST using q1HNMR.  A single internal standard solution was used for the calibrants and sampl es. 
 
NIST Analyses for  Vitamin D3  and 25 -Hydroxyvitamin D3:   Mass fractions of  vitamin D3  (cholecalciferol) and 
25-hydroxyvitamin D3  were measured in duplicate 2.0  g  to 3.0  g  test portions taken from each of ten  packets of 
SRM 1549a.  Vitamin D3-13C5 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-13C5 were added as internal standards.   Prior to extraction, 
the samples of SRM  1549a were incubated with lipase at 40  °C for 2  h to hydrolyze the fats.  Ethanol containing 
butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and potassium carbonate was added to each sample, and the  analytes and internal 
standards w ere extracted in to  hexane containing BHT by overnight stirring.  The samples were centrifuged
, the 
supernatants were decanted, and an additional aliquot of hexane containing BHT was added.  Samples were extracted 
further by a combination of sonication and rotary mixing, then centrifuged, and the supernatants combined with those 
from the previous extraction.  One additional cycle of sonication and rotary mixing was conducted, for a total of three 
extractions.  Magnesium sulfate was added to the pooled organic layers.  Following vortex mixing and centrifugation, 
the organic layer was decanted and evaporated to dryness under nitrogen.  The a
nalytes were derivatized with 
4-phenyl-1,2,4-triazoline-3,5-dione (PTAD) and reconstituted in a mixture of methanol and ethyl acetate for analysis 
by positive-ion mode LC-MS/MS.  A gradient method with a  water/methanol mobile phase and a  pentafluorophenyl 
column were used for ID-LC-MS/MS determination.  Vitamin D3+PTAD and vitamin D3-13C5+PTAD were measured 
25-Hydroxyvitamin D3+PTAD  and 
at  transitions  m/z 560 → m/z 298 and  m/z 565 → m/z 298, respectively.  
25-hydroxyvitamin D3-13C5+PTAD  were measured at 
transitions  m/z 558 → m/z 298 and  m/z 563 → m/z 298, 
respectively.  Calibrants were prepared gravimetrically, at levels intended to approximate the levels of the vitamins in 
by the

material was determined at NIST using LC-absorbance, Karl Fischer titration, TGA, and q1HNMR.  A single internal 
standard solution was used for the calibrants and samples. 
 
Analytical Approach for Determination of Fatty Acids:   Value assignment of the  mass fractions of fatty acids in 
SRM 1549a was based on the combination of measurements made using two extraction procedures and two different 
analytical methods at NIST  and by  collaborating laboratories, where appropriate .   NIST provided results using gas 
GC with flame ionization detection (FID) and GC-MS. 
 
NIST Analyses for Fatty Acids by GC-FID:  Mass fractions of fatty acids were determined by GC-FID from two 0.4 g 
to 0.8  g test portions from each of 10  packets of SRM  1549a.  The milk powder was   added to pressurized -fluid 
extraction (PFE) cells that were half filled with Hydromatrix (Varian, Palo Alto,  CA).  The milk powder was mixe d 
with the Hydromatrix and additional Hydromatrix was added to fill the cell.  The mixtures were spiked with an internal 
standard (IS)  solution containing  octacosanoic acid   and myristic -d27  acid  and 0.2  g water.   Following PFE with  
 (m-trifluoromethylphenyl) 
hexane:acetone (4:1  volume fraction), e xtracts were combined with methanolic
 min prior to 
trimethylammonium hydroxide (1:1  volume fraction), vortexed, and allowed to stand for at least 30
analysis by GC -FID.  GC -FID was performed using a 0.25  mm × 100 m  biscyanopropyl polysiloxane-fused silica 
capillary column.   Calibrants were prepared gravimetrically from SRM
2,2,4-Trimethylpentane, at levels intended to approximate the levels of the fatty acids in the SRM following extraction.  
A single internal standard solution was used for the calibrants and samples.  Calculations are based on average response 
factors for the calibrants. 
 
NIST Analyses for Fatty Acids by GC-MS:  Mass fractions of fatty acids were determined by  GC-MS from two 0.7 g 
to 0.9 g test portions from each of six packets of SRM 1549a.  The milk powder was combined with wet Hydromatrix 
An internal standard solution   containing 
and transferred to a glass extraction thimble containing glass wool.  
octacosanoic acid   and myristic -d27  acid  was  added, and samples were extracted for 22
chloride:methanol  (2:1 volume fraction)  solution.  Following extraction, extracts were concentrated,
  methanolic 
sodium hydroxide was added, and the sample was hea ted at 100 °C for 5 min with gentle shaking every 10  min.  The 
sample was cooled to room temperature, methanolic BF3 was added, and the samples were heated to 100 °C for 30 min.  
Butylated hydroxytoluene (an antioxidant) in hexane was added, and the sample  was mixed for 30  s while still warm.  
Saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution was added, and the sample was
temperature.  The hexane layer was removed to another tube, and the hexane extraction was repeated twice.  The three 
hexane layers were combined, and a portion was transferred to an autosampler vial for GC-MS analysis.  GC-MS was 
 mm × 60 m fused silica capillary column   containing  cyanopropyl/phenylpolysiloxane 
performed using a 0.25
(50/50 mole fraction) phases.  Calibrants were prepared gravimetrically from SRM 2377 Fatty Acid Methyl Esters in 
2,2,4-Trimethylpentane, at levels intended to approximate the levels of the fatty acids in the SRM following extraction.  
The internal standard solution was used for the calibrants and sa mples.  Calculations are based on average response 
factors for the calibrants.

Collaborating Laboratories’ Analyses:    The GMA FIACC laboratories  were asked to use their usual methods to 
make single measurements  of proximates, calories, vitamins, elements, and amino acids  on test portions taken from 
each of two packets of SRM 1549a.  Because of variability among data provided by  laboratories participating in  an 
interlaboratory comparison exercise, the median of laboratory means is used, with the uncertainty estimated using the 
median absolute deviation (MADe) [8]. 
 
Homogeneity Assessment:  The homogeneity of fatty acids, cholesterol, elements, and vitamins was assessed at NIST 
using the methods  and test portion sizes  described above.   Analysis of the variance  showed statistically significant 
molybdenum, nickel, 
heterogeneity  in some cases, and the uncertainties for barium, copper, iron, magnesium, 
phosphorus, strontium, zinc, niacinamide, pantothenic acid, pyridoxal, pyrido xamine, total vitamin B6 as pyridoxal, 
carnitine, choline,   cholecalciferol,  and  cholesterol  all incorporate an uncertainty component for possible 
heterogeneity.  Homogeneity of constituents measured solely by collaborating laboratories (e.g., proxim ates, amino 
acids) was not assessed although the data were treated as though these analytes were homogeneously distributed. 
 
Value Assignment:  For calculation of assigned values for analytes that were measured only by NIST, the mean s of 
the mean values from NIST results were used.  The collaborating laboratories reported the individual results for each 
of their analyses for a given analyte.  The mean of each laboratory’s result s was then determined.  For calculation of 
assigned values for analytes that were measured only by the collaborating laborat ories, the median of the laboratory 
means was used.  For analytes that were  also measured by NIST, the mean of the individual sets of NIST d ata were 
averaged with the median of the individual collaborating laboratory means, as appropriate. 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Value for Cholesterol:   The certified mass fraction for cholesterol is the mean of results 
obtained by NIST using ID -GC-MS.  Values are expressed as  x ± U95%(x), where x is the certified value and U95%(x) 
is the expanded uncertainty of the certified value.   The true value of the analyte lie s within the interval x ± U95%(x) 
with 95  % confidence.   To propagate this uncerta inty, treat the certified value as a normally distributed random 
variable with mean x and standard deviation U95%(x)/2 [2–4].  The measurand is the total mass fraction  of cholesterol 
in milk powder as  listed in Table 1 on a n as-received basis.   Metrological traceability is  to the SI  measurement unit 
for chemical mass fraction, expressed as milligrams per gram.

Certified Mass Fraction Values for Elements:   Each certified mass fraction value is the  combined mean from the  
mean of results from analyses by NIST and the median of the mean of results provi ded by collaborating laboratories, 
where appropriate.  Values are expressed as  x ± U95%(x), where x is the certified value and  U95%(x) is the expanded 
s  within the interval  x ± U95%(x)  with 95  % 
uncertainty of the certified value.  The true value of the analyte lie
confidence.   To propagate this uncertainty, treat the certified value as a normally  distributed random variable with 
mean  x  and standard deviation  U95%(x)/2 [2–4].   The measurand s  are  the total mass fraction s  of elements in milk

Reference Mass Fraction Values for Elements:    Each reference mass fraction  value is the mean result of NIST 
analyses using  ICP-MS.   Values are expressed as  x ± U95%(x), where  x  is the estimated value and  U95%(x) is the 
expanded uncertainty of the value.  The method-specific value of the analyte lies within the interval x ± U95%(x) with 
about a 95 % confidence [2-4].  The measurands are the mass fractions of elements in milk powder as listed in Table 4, 
on an as-received basis, as determined by the method i ndicated.  Metrological traceability is to the SI  measurement 
unit for chemical mass fraction, expressed as milligrams per kilogram.
