Reference Material 8543



NBS 18

(Carbon Isotopes in Carbonatite)



												This Reference Material (RM) is intended for use in developing and validating methods for measuring relative differences in carbon (C) isotopenumber ratios, R(13C/12C) [1].  Even though the value for this RM is a reference value and not certified [2], its use will improve the comparability of data from different laboratories.  The equivalent name for this RM as used by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is NBS 18.  A unit of RM 8543 consists of one bottle containing approximately 0.4 g of igneous calcium carbonate.

													A reference value is a noncertified value that is the best estimate of the true value; however, the value may reflect only the measurement precision and may not include all sources of uncertainty [2].

													The δ13C value is expressed as a mean and an expanded uncertainty.  An expanded uncertainty is equal to U = kuc, where uc is the combined standard uncertainty as defined by the JCGM Guide [3] and k is the coverage factor.  The value of the consensus mean and the associated combined standard uncertainty were calculated using a multivariate Bayesian approach [4].  The combined standard uncertainty is intended to represent, at the level of one standard deviation, the combined effects of uncertainty sources evaluated by both Type A and B methods.  Any uncertainty due to biases in the methods is not included in the expanded uncertainty.  The coverage factor, k = 2, provides an expanded uncertainty interval that has about a 95 % probability of encompassing the consensus mean.  The δ13C value and expanded uncertainty are taken from Table S4 (Supporting Info) [4]. (VPDB  Vienna Peedee belemnite; LSVEC  Li Svec (named for H. Svec, formerly of Ames Laboratory, Iowa)

		Expiration of Value Assignment:  RM 8543 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, until 31 December 2020, provided the RM is handled and stored in accordance with instructions given in this Report of Investigation (see “Instructions for Storage and Handling”).  This report is nullified if the RM is damaged, contaminated, or otherwise modified.

		

Maintenance of RM:  NIST will monitor this RM over the period of its validity.  If substantive technical changes occur that affect the value assignment before the expiration of this report, NIST will notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification.



The technical aspects involved in the issuance of this RM were coordinated through the NIST Chemical Sciences Division by R.D. Vocke, Jr.

Reference Difference in IsotopeNumber Ratio Values:  The differences in measured isotope-number ratios of stable carbon isotopes in substance P, R(13C/12C)P = [N(13C)P / N(12C)P], are reported as δ13C values [5].  The relative differences in isotope-number ratios for carbon are referenced to VPDB, where:

	δ13C = [R(13C/12C)sample / R(13C/12C)VPDB-LSVEC] – 1	(1)

												VPDBLSVEC refers to the Vienna PDBLSVEC scale which is defined by assigning a δ13C value of +1.95 ‰ to NBS 19 (RM 8544) and a consensus value of –46.6 ‰ to LSVEC (RM 8545) [6] for the purpose of normalizing stable carbon isotopic measurements (see Normalization [5,6]).  The symbol ‰ is part per thousand and is equal to 0.001.

												

		INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE AND HANDLING

		Storage and Handling:  RM 8543 is stable at normal room temperatures.  To minimize the potential for contamination, it is recommended that this RM be stored in the container in which it is supplied.

		

		Distribution:  The distribution of RM 8543 (NBS 18) is limited to one unit per customer per threeyear period of time.

	

	PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS



Sample Preparation:  RM 8543 (NBS 18) was prepared by H. Gerstenberger and M. Herrmann, Zentralinstitut für Isotopen und Strahlenforschung, Leipzig, Germany [7,8].



Analytical Methods:  The δ13C value and expanded uncertainty reported in Table 1 are taken from results of an inter-laboratory study involving a two point calibration [4].  Results from four expert laboratories (Centrum voor Isotopen Onderzoek, Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands; MaxPlanckInstitute for Biogeochemistry, Jena, Germany; UFZ (Umweltforschungszentrum) LeipzigHalle GmbH, Leipzig, Germany; U.S. Geological Survey, Reston, Virginia, USA) using continuous flow elementalanalyzer isotoperatio mass spectrometry and following the general method of Qi et al. [9] were combined using a multivariate Bayesian approach for data reduction [4].



The δ13C value and expanded uncertainty reported in Table 1 for RM 8543 (NBS 18) is the value accepted by the Commission on Isotopic Abundances and Atomic Weights (CIAAW) of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) (http://ciaaw.org/Carbon.htm) for this RM as of the date of this report.



Isotopic Homogeneity:  Data from the inter-laboratory comparisons of NBS 18 suggest that there may be carbon isotopic heterogeneity at the grain to grain level.



Normalization:  The δ13C values in samples should be normalized to the VPTBLSVEC δscale by calibrating the measurement with respect to the δvalue for NBS 19 (RM 8544) and the δvalue for LSVEC (RM 8545), the 13Cdepleted anchor RM [5,6].  A general formula for normalizing measured carbon isotope number ratios using two laboratory standards LS1 (NBS 19) and LS2 (LSVEC) can be expressed as: 



		(2)



where the normalization factor f is:



		(3)

Note:  In the above formulas, cal denotes calibrated measurements made versus the VPDB scale, and δ13C LS1,cal and δ13C LS2,cal are the conventionally fixed δ13C values for NBS 19 and LSVEC.  WS denotes measurements made versus a transfer gas (working standard), δ13C LS1,WS, and δ13C LS2,WS are the δ13C values for calibrated laboratory working standards.



Reporting of Stable Carbon Isotope δ values:  The following recommendations from IUPAC are provided for reporting δ13C values [5,6,10].  It is recommended that:

δ13C values of all carbon-bearing substances be measured and expressed relative to VPDB on a normalized scale where LSVEC has a consensus value of –46.6 ‰ and NBS 19 has a value of +1.95 ‰; 

Authors should clearly state that their data have been normalized. 

In addition, researchers are encouraged to report the isotopic compositions of RM 8543 (NBS 18) and other internationally distributed carbon isotopic reference materials [11] in their publications, as appropriate to the method, as though they have been interspersed among unknowns.
