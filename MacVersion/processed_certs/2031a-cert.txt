This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is a primar
Reference Spectrophotometer [1,2].  It  is intended for use in the verifica tion of the transmitta nce and absorbance 
scales of spectrophotometers in the ultraviolet and visible spectral regions.  SRM 2031a is a set that consists of 
three individual neutral density filters in separate metal holders and one empty filter holder stored in a black 
anodized aluminum  container [3,4].  The exposed surface of each filter is approximately 29 mm 
measuring from a point 1.5 mm above the base of the filte
with shutters that protect the filters when not in use.  Each filter-containing holder bears an identification number 
for the set and an individual filter number (10, 30, or 90) that corresponds to the 
(100 × transmittance) of the filter.  SRM 2031a differs from 
optical polishing tolerances. 
 
  Certified transmittance density values, 
Certified Values of Transmittance
± 1 °C and at ten wavelengths in the ultraviolet and visible 
independently determined  for each filter at 22 °C 
portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, are given in 
Table 1a.  These values are calculated from measured 
transmittances (T) as -log 10(T), and should be indicated by the absorbance (A) scale of the spectrophotometer, if 
the filters are measured against air.  The corresponding cer
expanded uncertainties for the certified transmittance density values of Table 1a are calculated from uncertainty 
components given in Tables 2, 3, and 4 (see Dete
rmination of Expanded Uncertainties).  The expanded 
uncertainties for the transmittance values of Table 1b are calculated from the transmittance density uncertainties.  
The expanded uncertainties allow for possible changes due to slight surface contamination and fundamental material 
effects over the two year period following certification.  
The certified values are valid  for instrumental spectral 
slit width values of 10 nm or less. 
 
Expiration of Certification:   This certification is valid within the measurement uncertainties specified for two 
fied for this set in Tables 1a and 1b, provided the SRM is handled and 
years from the date of certification speci
(see Instructions for Use).   However, the 
stored in accordance with  the instructions given in this certificate 
certification will be nullified if the SRM

Handling) [3,4].  Because th e transmittance of these filters  exhibits appreciable opti cal neutrality, the dependence 
of transmittance on slit width is not critical, and spectral slit widths up to 10 nm may be used.  
 
Instrument verification should be performed at an ambient temperatur e between 20 °C and 24 °C.  The empty filter 
holder provided is to be used in the reference beam of th e spectrophotometer so that approximately equivalent stray 
radiation conditions are maintained for both beams.  The s hutters provided with each filter must be removed at the 
time of measurement and replaced after the measurements ha ve been completed.  Measurements performed outside 
of these specified conditions or the optical geometry used for certification (see Determination of Transmittances) 
could produce transmittance values that differ from the certified values. 
 
To demonstrate that a user’s measurements are traceable , within acceptable limits, to  the accuracy transferred by 
rances or acceptable uncertain ty for the application in 
SRM 2031a, the user must first determine the required tole
question.  It is recommended that a number of replicate measurements be 
made for each filter and wavelength, 
ilter between replicate measurements.   The user should then compare each 
with removal and replacement of the f
mean value and the user-defined tolera nce with the NIST certified value and expanded uncertainty (see Table 1a or 
1b).   An acceptable level of agreement between a user’s  measurements and the certified value is demonstrated if 
any part of the range defined by the NIST certified valu

NOTICE AND WARNINGS TO USERS 
 
Storage and Handling:   Each SRM 2031a set is stored in an aluminum container to minimize contamination of

the filter surfaces with particulate matte

ontainer.  Each filte r holder is provided 
with a flat leaf spring that is inserted into the cylindrical cavity of the unit for transportation.  These springs should 
be removed during use.  Improper storage or handling of the filters may cause changes in the transmittance.  It 
is recommended that the filter in the holder be handl

Instrument Dependence Warning:

for certain instruments, these effects c ould become significant.  If such effect s are detected or suspected, the user 
should contact J.C. Travis, NIST Biochemical Science Division, at (301) 975-4117 or via email at

Source and Preparation of Material:   Ground and polished fused-silica com ponents were produced by Starna 
Cells, Inc., Atascadero, CA.  The ev
Albuquerque,  NM.  Filters 10 and 30 were produced by evapora ting different thicknesses  of chromium metal onto 
1.5 mm thick fused-silica plates that have been precision ground and polished.  These metal films are protected by 
1.9 mm thick fused-silica cover plates optically contacted to the base plates.  Filter 90 is a 3 mm thick fused-silica 
plate having a nominal transmittance of 0.9.  Each fuse
d-silica piece used in SRM 2031a has been polished to a 
flatness of two fringes of the mercury green line (546.1 nm),  and assembled filters were  tested for a deviation from 
parallelism of less than 2  × 10 -4 radians.  Prior to certification measurements, the filters were aged at NIST for at 
least six months, and each filter was examined for surface defects and the condition of the optical contact.

Determination of Transmittances:  The transmittance measurements are made against air (an empty filter holder) 
at an ambient temperature of 22 °C 
ophotometer designed and built in the 
NIST Analytical Chemistry Division [1,2].  This instrument represents a primary transmittance standard; its 
transmittance accuracy is established us ing the double aperture method of linearity  testing [1,2,6].  The effective 
spectral slit width used to determine the certified values is 1.0 nm.  The transmittance measurements are made by 
projecting the vertical image of the slit (approximately 4 mm  × 1 mm) onto the middle of the entrance face of the 
filter using 1:1 imaging and convergent b eam geometry with an aperture ratio  of f/10.  The filter is mounted in a 
multiple filter carriage in the spectrophot ometer.  Each transmittance value repor ted in Table 1b is the average of 
three transmittance values over the several minute period required for three carriage cycles.  The filters are 
measured in the spectrophotometer in a  position perpendicular to the incident 
Each transmittance value is calculate d from a measurement of the intens

approximately 3 seconds  followed  by  a signal integration time of approximately 2 seconds.  Transmittance is 
monitored several times over the filter aging period of at least six months.  Only the final measurements are used 
as the basis for the certified values. 
 
Uniformity:  The transmittance density uniformity of each SRM  2031a filter is tested at all certified wavelengths 
by comparing the transmittance density  measured at the center of each filter  with that measured 7 mm below the 
center.   Filters are rejected if the  relative difference of the two readings ex ceeds the allowable limits that have been 
established.  These limits are 0.0035  absorbance units for filter 10, 0.003 ab sorbance units for filter 30, and 0.001 
absorbance units for filter 90.  These limits are reflected in Table 4 and were established experimentally for prior 
filters of this type by sampling 1 mm 
× 20 mm long and located 
symmetrically about the center face of each filter [7].  
 
Determination of Expanded Uncertainties:   The expanded uncertainties,  U, of the certified transmittance density 
uncertainties (i.e., estimated 
values of Table 1a, reported in Table 2, are determined from combined standard 
standard deviations) of component uncertainties repor ted in Tables 3 and 4, and a coverage factor 
k = 2 based on 
the Student’s  t-distribution for more than 30 degrees of freedom 
(DF) [8].  The expanded uncertainty defines an 
interval within which the unknown value of  the transmittance can be asserted to  lie with a level of confidence of 
approximately 95 %.  This uncertainty includes “Type A” uncertainties evaluated by statistical methods and 
“Type B”  uncertainties evaluated by  other means.  The standard uncertain ties are combined by the root-sum-of-
squares method.   
 
The Type A standard uncertainty component for each le

Most of the Type B uncertainty components of Table 4 were estimated from studies described in NIST Special 
Publication 260-68 [4].  The Type B standard uncertainties are derived from an estimate of the ranges of the 
components [8].
