Certificate of Analysis 
Standard Reference Material® 2668 

 

 
Toxic Elements in Frozen Human Urine 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended primarily for validating analytical methods and measurements 
for the determination of toxic elements in human urine.  A unit of SRM 2668 consists of five vials of each of two 
levels.  Each vial contains nominally 1.5 mL of urine.  SRM 2668 is shipped on dry ice, and it should be stored at 
−70 C until use.  
 
The  development  of  SRM 2668  was  a  collaboration  between  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and 
Technology (NIST) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Centers for Environmental 
Health, Division of Laboratory Sciences, Atlanta, GA. 
 
Certified  Mass  Concentration  Values:    Certified  mass  concentration  values  for  6  elements  in  Level I  and  14 
elements in Level II of SRM 2668 are listed in Table 1.  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the 
highest confidence in its accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into 
account [1].  Values were derived from the combination of results provided by NIST and collaborating laboratories.  
The certified values in this material are the weighted means [2-4] of the individual sets of measurements made by 
NIST  and  collaborating  laboratories.    The  associated  expanded  uncertainties  include  between-laboratory, 
within-laboratory,  and  inhomogeneity  components  of  uncertainty  and  are  provided  at  the  95 %  level  of 
confidence [5]. 
 
Reference  Mass  Concentration  Values:    Reference  mass  concentration  values  for  17  elements  in  Level I  and  9 
elements in Level II are provided in Table 2.  Reference values are noncertified values that are the best estimate of 
the true values based on available data; however, the values do not meet the NIST criteria for certification [1] and 
are provided with associated uncertainties that may not include all sources of uncertainty.   
 
Information Values:  Information values for mass concentration of creatinine are listed in Table 3.  An information 
value is considered to be a value that will be of interest to the SRM user, but insufficient information is available to 
assess the uncertainty associated with the value [1]. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 2668 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until 31 December 2021, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given in this 
certificate (see “Instructions for Handling, Storage, and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, 
contaminated, or otherwise modified.  
 
Maintenance  of  SRM  Certification:    NIST  will  monitor  this  SRM  over  the  period  of  its  certification.    If 
substantive  technical  changes  occur  that affect  the  certification before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST will 
notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
The coordination of the technical measurements leading to the certification was under the direction of L.L. Yu and 
G.C. Turk of the NIST Analytical Chemistry Division.  
 
Statistical analysis was provided by D.D. Leber of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division. 
 
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Measurement  Services 
Division.

NOTICE AND WARNING TO USERS 
 
SRM 2668  IS  INTENDED  FOR  LABORATORY  USE  ONLY.    THIS  IS  A  HUMAN  SOURCE  MATERIAL.  
HANDLE  PRODUCT  AS  A  BIOHAZARDOUS  MATERIAL  CAPABLE  OF  TRANSMITTING  INFECTIOUS 
DISEASE.  This product should be handled at the Biosafety Level 2 or higher as recommended in the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention/National Institutes of Health manual [6] 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
The  SRM  should  be  stored  at  –70 C  in  the  original  unopened  Mylar  bag.    The  certification  does  not  apply  to 
contents of previously opened bags as the stability of all analytes has not been investigated under such conditions.  
SRM 2668  should  be  thawed  at  room  temperature.    The  material  should  be  used  within  4 h  after  being  thawed.  
Unused  or  remaining  material  should  be  discarded  after  the  specified  time.    Each  vial  of  the  SRM  should  be 
homogenized by gently inverting the vial several times before a test portion is removed.  A minimum test portion of 
0.5 mL should be used for the values provided in this certificate to be valid. 
 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
The  urine  used  for  the  preparation  of  SRM 2668  was  collected  at  CDC  from  volunteers  in  Spring 2007  using  a 
protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board of the CDC.  Each urine specimen, collected in a plastic cup, 
was screened for trace element contents and then combined in one of the two 17 L urine pools.  While stirring, the 
urine pools were acidified slowly to contain 1 % nitric acid (volume fraction).  The pooled urine was centrifuged for 
60 min  at  3700 gn,  and  the  precipitates  discarded.    The  concentrations  of  trace  elements  in  the  two  pools  were 
adjusted  to  the  target  levels  (see  below)  with  addition  of  appropriate  amounts  of  NIST SRM 3100  series 
single-element standards or the equivalent.  On the day of production, aliquots of 1.8 mL from each urine pool were 
dispensed into 2 mL cryovials under class 100 clean room condition.  The vials were capped, heat-sealed in Mylar 
bags, stored at –70 °C at CDC and at NIST following transfer (on dry ice).   
 
The target levels of trace elements in Level I and Level II of the SRM were designed to represent the 50th to 95th 
and  >95th  percentiles,  respectively,  of  the  concentrations  (with  some  adjustments)  in  the  U.S.  population  based 
primarily on data from the National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals (2005-2006 National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) [7]. 
 
Analytical determinations for certification of this SRM were performed at NIST, CDC, Mayo Clinic, and NYSDOH 
using methods listed in Table 4. 
 

 

                                                           
1Certain  commercial  equipment,  instruments  or  materials  are  identified  in  this  certificate  to  adequately  specify  the 
 
experimental  procedure.    Such  identification  does  not  imply  recommendation  or  endorsement  by  the  National  Institute  of 
Standards and Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the 
purpose.

Homogeneity:    Except  for  creatinine,  chlorine,  fluoride,  potassium,  and  sodium,  measurements  for  homogeneity 
assessment  were  made  at  CDC  using  inductively  coupled  plasma  mass  spectrometry  methods  listed  in  Table 4.  
Measurements  for  homogeneity  assessment  of  fluoride  were  made  at  NIST  using  the  potentiometry  (fluoride 
ion-selective electrode) method listed in Table 4.  The SRM was determined inhomogeneous based on the analysis 
of  within-vial  and  between-vial  variances  and  on  visual  inspection.    This  observed  vial-to-vial  variability  is 
incorporated  into  the  expanded  uncertainties  of  the  certified  and  reference  values  using  statistical  Monte  Carlo 
methods consistent with the methods suggested by Supplement 1 to the ISO Guide [8].  Although homogeneity of 
chlorine, potassium, and sodium was not assessed, a statistical prediction interval was leveraged when expressing 
the expanded uncertainties of these elements to reflect the material heterogeneity. 
 
Stability:  Except  for  that  of  creatinine,  chlorine,  fluoride,  potassium,  and  sodium,  stability  was  monitored  at 
intervals of approximately every six months for a period of more than two years.  All analytes under the stability 
monitoring program were determined to be stable by one of two methods:  If the number of times (N) the stability 
monitoring  measurements  were  conducted  was  less  than  or  equal  to  6,  each  stability  measurement  value  had  to 
overlap the certified or reference value to be considered stable.  If N > 6, the measurement data were analyzed with 
linear  regression.   At  95 % confidence,  the  slope of  the regression  analysis  had  to  include 0 for  the analyte  to  be 
considered stable.

Certified values and reference values for trace elements are weighted means of results from NIST and collaborating 
laboratories,  found  by  leveraging  a  linear,  Gaussian  random  effects  statistical  model [2,3]  and  the  methods  of 
maximum likelihood estimation [4,9] or the DerSimonian-Laird procedure [2,10].  Maximum likelihood estimation 
was utilized when degrees of freedom were readily available, otherwise the DerSimonian-Laird procedure was used.  
The  estimation  procedures  are  supplemented  by  the  parametric  bootstrap [11]  for  uncertainty  propagation.    The 
associated  uncertainty  is  expressed  as  an  expanded  uncertainty,  U.    The  expanded  uncertainty  is  calculated  as 
U = kuc,  where  uc  is  intended  to  represent,  at  the  level  of  one  standard  deviation,  the  combined  effect  of 
between-laboratory,  within-laboratory,  and  inhomogeneity  components  of  uncertainty.    The  coverage  factor (k) 
corresponds to approximately 95 % confidence for each analyte. 
 
Reference  mass  concentration  values  for  major  components  are  the  mean  results  of  one  NIST  method.    The 
associated uncertainty is expressed as an expanded uncertainty, U.  The expanded uncertainty is calculated as U = kuc, 
where uc is intended to represent, at the level of one standard deviation, the combined effect of within-laboratory and 
inhomogeneity components of uncertainty.  The coverage factor (k) corresponds to approximately 95 % confidence 
for each analyte. The associated expanded uncertainty was calculated in accordance with the ISO Guide [5].
