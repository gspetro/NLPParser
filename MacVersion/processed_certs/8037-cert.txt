Reference Material 8037 

Krill Oil 

 
Reference Material (RM) 8037 is intended primarily for use in evaluation of analytical methods for determining fatty 
acids in fish oils , dietary supplements, and similar materials .  This RM provides a common matrix to those in the 
natural products community who wish to conduct research studies .  A unit of  RM 8037 consists of three screw -top 
tins, each containing approximately 4.5 mL of krill oil. 
 
The development of RM 8037 was a collaboration between the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 
and the National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements (NIH-ODS). 
 
Reference Mass Fraction Values of Fatty Acids :  Reference mass fraction values for fatty acids  in RM 8037 are 
provided in Table 1.  A NIST reference value is a noncertified value that is the best estimate of the true value based 
on available data; however, the value does not meet the NIST criteria for 
certification [1] and is provided with  an 
associated uncertainty that may reflect only measurement reproducibility, may not include all sources of uncertainty, 
or may reflect a lack of sufficient statistical agreement a mong multiple analytical methods. 
  The reference mass 
fraction values were derived from results reported by NIST and/or collaborating laboratories.  Values are reported on 
an as-received basis in mass fraction units of free fatty acids in RM 8037 [2]. 
 
Expiration of  Value Assignments :    RM 8037  is valid, within the measurement 
uncertainty  specified,  until 
31 December 2029, provided the RM is handled and stored in accordance with instructions given in thi s Report of 
Investigation (see “Instructions for Storage and Use”).   This report is nullified if the RM is damaged, contaminated, 
or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of RM  Value Assignment:  NIST will monitor this RM over th e period of its  value assignment.  If 
substantive technical changes occur that affect the  value assignments before the expiration of this  report, NIST will 
notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification.

exercise were performed by M.M. Phillips and L.J. Wood of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division and by W. Koshute

NOTICE TO USERS:    RM 8037  IS INTENDED FOR RESEARCH USE ;  NOT FOR HUMAN OR ANIMAL 
CONSUMPTION. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE AND USE 
 
Storage:  The RM should be stored frozen (–20 °C or colder), in original unopened tins, until required for use.  Value 
assignment does not apply to contents of previously opened and stored tins as the stability of fatty acids has not been 
investigated in previously opened tins.  
 
Use:  Before use, the contents of the  tin should be allowed to warm to room temperature and  mixed thoroughly.  To 
relate analytical determinations to the   values in this  Report of Investigation ,  a minimum test portion size of 0.2  g 
should be used to ensure valid results.  Results obtained in analyses should include their own estimates of uncertainty 
and can be compared to the non-certified or reference values using procedures described in reference 3. 
 
SOURCE, PREPARATION, AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Source and Preparation:  The RM is a  krill oil prepared by a commercial manufacturer.   A 5 kg container of krill 
oil was received at NIST from a commercial manufacturer of krill oil.  The oil was warmed to room temperature and 
gently rotated to mix the contents.  Approximately 4.5 mL of krill oil was transferred into screw-top tins, then stored 
at –20 °C. 
 
Analytical Approach for Determination of  Fatty Acids:  Value assignment of the  mass fractions of fatty acids in 
RM 8037  was based on the combination of measurements made using gas chromatography wi
th flame ionization 
detection (GC-FID) at NIST and collaborating laboratories, where appropriate. 
 
GC-FID measurements at NIST:   Mass fractions of free fatty acids were determined from  duplicate, nominal 0.2 g 
test portions from  10 screw-top tins of RM 8037.  The test portions of krill oil  were weighed into  15 mL centrifuge 
tubes with Teflon caps.   One milliliter of chloroform was added to each tube volumetrically and  1 mL of internal 
standard solution containing myristic acid -d27 and palmitic acid-d31 was added gravimetrically.  Additions of 1.5 mL 
of 1.0 mol/L NaOH (in methanol) ; 2.0 mL of 14  % (volume fraction) boron trifluoride (BF 3 in methanol); 3  mL of 
40 mg/L BHT (in hexane); and 5 mL of saturated NaCl (aq.)  were added and, after each addition,  the samples were 
blanketed with N 2, capped, and heated in a dry bath .  A portion of the hexane/BHT layer was then transferred to an 
autosampler vial for GC-FID analysis.  Analysis was by GC-FID using a 0.32 mm × 30 m FAMEWAX column with 
a 0. 25 µm film.     Calibrants were prepared gravimetrically   from  SRM 2377  Fatty Acid Methyl Esters in 2,2,4
-
Trimethylpentane, at levels intended to approximate the levels of f atty acids in RM 8037.  A single internal standard 
solution was used for the calibrants and samples.  Calculations are based on average response factors for the calibrants. 
 
Collaborating Laboratories’ Analyses:  The GMA FIACSG laboratories were asked to use their usual methods t o 
make single measurements on test portions taken from each of two tins of RM 8037 for measurements of fatty acids.  
Because of the variability among data provided by laboratories participating in an interlaboratory comparison exercise, 
the median of laboratory means is used, with the uncertainty estimate
e 
h NIST data for 
deviation (MADe) [4].    The median of the collaborating laboratories’ means was combined wit
calculation of  reference values of fatty acids , where appropriate,  with the uncertainty estimated using the standard 
error of the mean of laboratory means.  The methods used by collaborating laboratories were all reported as utilizing 
a sample hydrolysis and derivatization step followed by analysis using GC-FID.

Homogeneity Assessment:  The homogeneity of fatty acids was assessed at NIST using the methods and test portion 
ed  possible  statistically significant heterogeneity   for 
sizes described above
(Z)-9-Tetradecenoic Acid
 (C18:1 n-9), 
(Z)-9-Octadecenoic Acid
(Z)-11-Octadecenoic Acid (C18:1 n-7), and  (Z,Z)-9,12-Octadecadienoic Acid (C18:2 n -6), and the uncertainties for 
these values incorporate an additional component for possible heterogeneity. 
 
Value Assignment:  For calculation of assigned values for analytes that were measured only at NIST, the mean values 
from NIST results were used.  The collaborating laboratories reported the individual results for each of their analyses 
for a given analyte.   The mean of each  laboratory’s results was then determined.   For calculation of assigned values 
for analytes that were measured only by the GMA FIACSG laboratories, the median of the laboratory means was used.  
For analytes that were also measured by NIST, the mean of  the individual sets of NIST data were averaged with the 
median of the individual GMA FIACSG laboratory means. 
 
Reference Mass Fraction Values for Fatty Acids as Free Fatty Acids:   Each reference mass fraction value is the 
mean result of a  NIST analysis using a single method or the mean from the combination of NIST results wit
h the 
median of the mean results provided by 
collaborating laboratories  where appropriate.     Values are expressed as 
x ± U95%(x), where x is the estimated value and U95%(x) is the expanded uncertainty of the value.  The method-specific 
value of the analyte lies within the interval  x ± U95%(x) with about a 95 % confidence [5-7].  The measurands are the 
mass fraction s  of  fatty acid s  in krill oil listed in Table  1, on an as -received basis,  as determined by the method 
indicated.  Metrological traceability is to the measurement processes and standard s used by NIST and collaborating 
laboratories.
