(Self-Verification, 8-mm Striker)

Lot No.:  LL-171 
 

This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended for the verification of Charpy machines equipped with an 8-mm 
striker, in accordance with the current ASTM Standard E23 [1] and the current ISO Standard 148-2 [2].  Each SRM 
consists of a set of five specimens needed to perform one verification.  SRM 2093 is used for in-house verification 
(self-verification).  
 
Material  Description:    SRM 2093  is  made  from  4340  alloy  steel.    The  bars  are  finished  to  length,  stamped, 
heat-treated, and machined in SRM specimen lots of approximately 1200 to 2000 specimens.  Each specimen has a 
lot number and an identification number (three or four digits). 
 
SRM Certification Procedure:  Specimens taken from each SRM lot were tested by the NIST Applied Chemicals 
and  Materials  Division  on  Charpy  reference  machines.    These  data  were  statistically  evaluated  to  assess  the 
homogeneity of the lot, establish the certified value, and determine the number of SRM specimens required for a user 
to perform a valid verification.   A NIST certified value, as used within the context of this certificate, is a value for 
which  NIST  has  the  highest  confidence  in  its  uncertainty  assessment [3].    The measurand is absorbed energy as 
measured  by the NIST reference machines.    Traceability is to the SI unit joule.    The  certified  value  for  energy 
absorbed by SRM 2093 is provided in Table 1.

(a)   The uncertainty in the certified value provided is an expanded uncertainty.    The expanded uncertainty is calculated as U = kuc, 
where uc represents the combined standard uncertainty consistent with the JCGM Guide [4].  The coverage factor, k = 1.9935, 
is based on 72 degrees of freedom and corresponds to an approximate 95 % uncertainty interval. 

 
Expiration  of  Certification:    The  certified  value  and  uncertainty  furnished  in  the  verification  report  are  valid 
indefinitely.  The verification statement in the report that is issued for an acceptable machine is valid for a maximum 
of one year from the date on which the SRM was tested.  If a user’s machine is moved or undergoes any major repairs 
or adjustments, the current verification  will be invalidated, and the  machine  must  be  retested  and  reverified  (see 
“Instructions for Handling, Storage, and Use”). 

Overall  direction  and  coordination  of  the  technical  measurements  leading  to  verification  of  test  specimens  and 
machines are under the direction of the NIST Applied Chemicals and Materials Division (Boulder, CO).

Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical changes occur that affect the certification before the expiration of this certificate, NIST will notify the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
Handling:  The protective oil coating should be wiped from each specimen with a lint-free cloth just prior to testing. 
 
Storage:  The SRMs are anticipated to have an indefinite shelf life under normal storage conditions (20 °C ± 20 °C, 
≤ 50 % relative humidity). 
 
Use:  Prior to verifying a Charpy machine equipped with an 8-mm striker, the machine should be checked to ensure 
compliance  with  the  appropriate  sections  of  the  applicable  ASTM  or  ISO  Standard.    SRM 2093  is  tested 
at -40 °C ± 1 °C (–40 °F ± 2 °F) in accordance with the applicable standard (ASTM or ISO).  The SRM can be used 
as  a  substitute  for  SRM 2096  to  meet  the  indirect  verification  requirement  of  ASTM E23  and  ISO 148-2  when 
no-post  verification  test  analysis  from  NIST  is  needed.    The  SRM  cannot  be  used  to  verify  a  Charpy  machine 
equipped with a 2-mm striker. 
 
When using SRM 2093, the user performs a self-service verification of the test machine.    The data and specimens 
are not returned to NIST following the test.  NIST provides no letter or certification sticker for the machine verified. 
 
The energy level of the SRM appropriate for verifying the performance of a particular Charpy impact machine can 
be determined by considering the energy for the SRM, the maximum capacity of the machine, and the requirements 
of the applicable test method (ASTM or ISO).
