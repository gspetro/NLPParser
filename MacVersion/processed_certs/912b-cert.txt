Certificate of Analysis 
Standard Reference Material 912b 
 
Urea 

 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is certified as a neat chemical of known purity.  It is a primary standard 
intended for use during calibration procedures and method validations implemented by clinical laboratories.  A unit 
of SRM 912b consists of 25 g of high-purity crystalline urea. 
 

Certified Urea Mass Fraction:  99.95 %  ±  0.01% 

SRM

 
A NIST certified  value is a  value  for  which NIST has the  highest confidence in its accuracy  in that all known or 
suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [1].  The certified value [2] was determined 
using a mass balance approach for purity assessment.  The uncertainty was determined as the 95 % coverage interval 
(U95) [3,4] of the probability distribution function evaluated using a Bayesian statistical approach implemented via a 
Markov Chain Monte Carlo method.  The measurand is the total concentration of urea.  Metrological traceability is to 
the SI derived unit for mass fraction (expressed as percent).  Biuret is the primary impurity component [5], followed 
by water with approximate mass fractions of 0.025 % and 0.015 %, respectively. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 912b is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until 30 September 2027, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given in this 
certificate (see “Instructions for Handling, Storage, and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, 
contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical changes occur that affect the certification, NIST will notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet 
or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Overall direction and coordination of the technical activities were under the chairmanship of M.A. Nelson of the NIST 
Chemical Sciences Division. 
 
Analytical  measurements  at  NIST  were  performed  by  B.E. Lang,  M.A. Nelson,  and  J.S. Pritchett  of  the  NIST 
Chemical Sciences Division.  
 
Statistical analysis was provided by B. Toman of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division.  
 
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Office  of  Reference 
Materials.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE, AND USE 
 
Storage:  The SRM should be stored in the original bottle at temperatures between 20 °C and 30 °C.  It must be 
tightly re-capped after use and protected from excessive moisture, heat, and light.  Refrigeration is recommended 
(4 °C), however the material should be brought to room temperature (between 20 °C and 30 °C) before opening 
the  container.    Urea  at  these  temperatures  is  significantly  hygroscopic  when  exposed  to  high  relative  humidity 
conditions (>75 %) [6] and this material should be contained under controlled low humidity.   
 
Use:    SRM 912b  stored  as  described  above,  can  be  used  without  preliminary  drying.   The  minimum  sample  size 
required is 10 mg.  
 
SOURCE AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Source  of  Material:    The  SRM  material  was  obtained  from  Spectrum  Chemical  Manufacturing  Corp.  (New 
Brunswick, NJ). 
 
Analytical  Approach  and  Homogeneity  Assessment:    Analyses  for  chemical  purity  and  homogeneity  were 
performed by NIST.  Evaluations were performed using twenty two units, randomly selected from across the filling 
run,  via  differential  scanning  calorimetry (DSC),  1H-nuclear  magnetic  resonance (NMR),  and  a  mass  balance 
approach  for  purity  evaluation  that  included  Karl  Fischer  titration,  Liquid  Chromatography  with  Ultraviolet 
Detection (LC-UV), ion chromatography with electrochemical detection, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).  No 
trend in mass fraction purity was observed with respect to filling order and there is no discernible inhomogeneity at 
the 95 % confidence level.  Biuret and water content mass fractions were respectively determined using a targeted 
LC-UV calibration method and Karl Fischer titration.
