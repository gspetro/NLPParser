Certificate of Analysis 
 
Standard Reference Material 2780a 

 

Hard Rock Mine Waste 

 
 
primarily 
This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  use  in  validation  of  chemical  and  instrumental 
methods of analysis used to determine elements in hard rock mine waste and materials of a similar matrix.  It can be 
used to validate value assignment of in-house reference materials.  SRM 2780a is composed of material collected from 
waste  piles  of  abandoned  mine  sites  in  the  mountains  of  central  Colorado.    A  unit  of  SRM 2780a  consists  of 
approximately 50 g of material of which 90 % passes a 150 µm (No. 100) sieve. 
 
Certified  Mass  Fraction  Values:    Certified  values  for  constituents  in  SRM 2780a  are  listed  in  Table 1 as  mass 
fractions of the total amounts of the elements in rock powder [1].  A NIST-certified value is a value for which NIST 
has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been taken into account 
[2].  A certified value is the present best estimate of the true value.  The certified values are metrologically traceable 
to  the  SI  derived  unit  of  mass  fraction  expressed  as  either  percent  or  milligrams  per  kilogram.    The  expanded 
uncertainty intervals are expressed at a coverage level of approximately 95 %. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 2780a is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until  31 December 2028,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  instructions  given  in  this 
certificate (see “Instructions for Handling, Storage and Use”).  Reference values are expected also to remain valid 
yn  is  nullified 
within this period.  Periodic recalibration or recertification of this SRM is not required.  This certification is nullified 
if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Coordination of technical measurements for the certification of this SRM was performed by J.R. Sieber of the NIST 
Chemical  Sciences  Division.    Coordination  of  measurements  by  international  collaborators  was  performed  by 
M.A. Cabral de Goes of the Center for Mineral Technology (CETEM), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 
 
Statistical consultation for this SRM was provided by A.L. Pintar of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE, HANDLING AND   USE 
 
The values listed for this SRM were determined on the as-received basis.  No drying is necessary.  Sampling and 
sample preparation procedures should be designed to avoid material segregation on the basis of particle size.  It is 
recommended to mix the contents of the bottle prior to sampling by turning the bottle end over end for two minutes.  
If particle size reduction is performed, it is the user’s responsibility to prevent contamination or loss of material.  This 
SRM must be stored in an air-conditioned or similar cool and dry environment away from light and fumes.  A value 
for  loss  on  ignition (LOI)  at  950 ºC  is  provided  to  enable  the  user  to  check  for  changes  to  stored  material  by 
determining the LOI in the user’s laboratory and comparing the result to the value in Table 2 in this certificate. 
 
To relate analytical determinations to the values in this Certificate of Analysis, a minimum sample quantity of 250 mg 
is recommended based on the quantities used for most test methods.  From testing using microscale X-ray fluorescence 
spectrometry, a specimen mass as low as 5 mg is appropriate for the elements Al, As, Ca, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, 
P, Pb, S, Si, Ti, V, and Zn.

user

To use the uncertainty intervals given in this certificate in comparisons and calculations, the user must be aware that 
most intervals are not symmetric about the assigned values.  The use of the intervals depends on the context, and 
instructions for two common uses follow [3,4]. 
 
Direct comparison to a result of a user determination:  For this case, directly compare a coverage interval calculated 
by the user for their result to the appropriate coverage interval provided in this certificate. 
 
Propagation  of  uncertainty  when  using  SRM 2780a  as  a  calibration  standard:    When  a  value  provided  in  this 
certificate  is  used  to  calibrate  a  measurement  process,  the  uncertainty  associated  with  that  value  should  be 
appropriately propagated into the user’s uncertainty calculation.  The asymmetric intervals in Table 1 and Table 2 
cannot  be  interpreted  as  (value  ±  kuc),  where  k  is  an  expansion  factor,  and  uc  is  a  combined  standard  uncertainty 
representative of both sides of the interval around the value.  The user may choose one of the following two options 
for their uncertainty calculations.  A first option is to use an approximation to uc equal to one fourth of the width of 
the coverage interval given in this certificate (see note 8.1 in reference 3).  A second and better option is to use a 
Monte  Carlo  method  for  propagation  of  probability  distributions.    This  can  be  done  using  the  NIST  Uncertainty 
Machine  at  https://uncertainty.nist.gov.    The  user  would  enter  his  or  her  measurement  equation  and  standard 
uncertainty estimates or probability distributions describing uncertainty for the terms of the equation.  For the estimate 
of uncertainty of the calibration value, the user would choose the “Sample values” option and provide a file containing 
the actual distribution of the NIST analytical results of certification analyses.  Plain ASCII files for the constituents 
may be found at https://www-s.nist.gov/srmors/view_detail.cfm?srm=2780A.   
 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Collection and preparation of mine waste for SRM 2780a were performed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 
under the direction of S.A. Wilson, who collected materials from several sites in the mountains of central Colorado.  
Grinding, blending, and bottling were performed at USGS in Denver, Colorado.  On receipt by NIST, the entire lot of 
material was sterilized by irradiation.  Bottles were sealed into aluminized bags to promote long shelf life. 
 
Homogeneity  testing  was  performed  at  NIST  using  X-ray  fluorescence  spectrometry  and  microbeam  X-ray 
fluorescence spectrometry to measure numerous elements believed to be representative of the constituents given in 
this Certificate of Analysis.  Suitability of this material for testing using low milligram quantities was evaluated using 
microbeam X-ray fluorescence spectrometry [5,6] to evaluate the elements Al, As, Ca, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, P, 
Pb, S, Si, Ti, V, and Zn. 
 
For  each  certified  and  reference  value,  the  estimate  was  derived  by  fitting  a  statistical  model  to  the  results  of 
measurements using the test methods listed in Table 4.  That is, a posterior probability distribution, describing our 
knowledge  of  the  measurand,  was  developed  for  each  constituent.    Its  median  was  taken  as  the  estimate  of  the 
measurand, and the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles form the 95 % coverage interval.  The Bayesian paradigm was used for 
statistical inference [7].  The probability distribution combines all recognized sources of uncertainty.  This procedure 
is consistent with the ISO/JCGM Guide [8,9]. 
 
Measurements  for  value  assignment  of  SRM 2780a  were  performed  by  A.F. Marlow,  J.L. Molloy,  R.L. Paul,  and 
J.R. Sieber  of  the  NIST  Chemical  Sciences  Division.    Additional  analyses  were  performed  by  collaborating 
laboratories,  including  C. Bucknam,  H. Corsi,  J. Huddle,  and  J. Lorango  (Newmont  Metallurgical  Services, 
Englewood, Colorado,  United  States);  V. Kuch,  E. Matthews  and  B. White  (SGS  Canada  Minerals  Lakefield, 
Lakefield, Ontario,  Canada);  M. Adams  and  S.A. Wilson,  (United  States  Geological  Service,  Denver, Colorado, 
United States); J.A. Begum and R. Cardinall (AGAT Laboratories, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada); E. Miller (ALS

NOTICE TO USERS 
 
NIST strives to maintain the SRM inventory supply, but NIST cannot guarantee the continued or continuous supply 
of any specific SRM.  Accordingly, NIST encourages the use of this SRM as a primary benchmark for the quality and 
accuracy  of  the  user’s  in-house  reference  materials  and  working  standards.    As  such,  the  SRM  should  be  used  to 
validate the more routinely used reference materials in a laboratory.  Comparisons between the SRM and in-house 
reference materials or working measurement standards should take place at intervals appropriate to the conservation 
of  the  SRM  and  the  stability  of  relevant  in-house  materials.    For  further  guidance  on  how  this  approach  can  be 
implemented, contact NIST by email at srms@nist.gov.

ADDITIONAL CONSTITUENTS:  Noncertified values are provided for the following additional constituents in 
SRM 2780a. 
 
Reference Mass Fraction Values:  Reference values for SRM 2780a are reported in Table 2 as mass fractions of the 
constituents in rock powder.  A reference value is a non-certified value that is the present best estimate of the true 
value based on available data; however, the value does not meet the NIST criteria for certification and is provided 
with an associated uncertainty that may reflect only measurement precision, may not include all sources of uncertainty, 
or may reflect a lack of sufficient statistical agreement among multiple analytical methods [2].  The measurands are 
listed  in  Table  2  as  determined  by  the  methods  indicated.    The  reference  mass  fraction  values  are  metrologically 
traceable to the derived SI unit for mass fraction expressed as either percent or milligram per kilogram.
