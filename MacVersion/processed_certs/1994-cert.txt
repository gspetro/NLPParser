Standard Silicon Single Crystal Wafer for Crystalline Orientation 

 
This  Standard  Reference  Material  (SRM)  is  intended  for  use  in  the  calibration  of  instruments  (X-ray 
diffractometers)  used  to  measure  the  crystal  orientation  of  wafers  relative  to  the  crystal  surface.    The  SRM  unit 
consists of a 100-mm diameter silicon wafer.  The crystal orientation of the (001) silicon crystal planes relative to 
the surface normal has been measured both parallel and perpendicular to an edge flat that is manufactured into the 
wafer.  
 
Expiration  of  Certification:    The  certification  of  this  SRM  is  deemed  to  be  indefinite  within  the  stated 
uncertainties,  provided  the  SRM  is  stored  and  handled  in  accordance  with  the  (“Storage  and  Handling  and 
Instructions  for  Use”)  sections  of  this  certificate.    However,  certification  will  be  nullified  if  the  SRM  is 
contaminated or otherwise altered.   
 
Maintenance of Certified Values:  NIST will monitor this SRM and if substantive changes occur in the certified 
values, NIST will notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
Instructions  for  Use:    Dust  should  be  removed  from  the  SRM  wafer  surface  and  the  wafer  mount  prior  to 
installation in the X-ray diffractometer.  The flat manufactured into the wafer should be mounted either parallel or 
perpendicular  to  the  X-ray  plane  of  dispersion.    Consult  the  equipment  manufacturer’s  operating  instructions  for 
performing the actual measurements with the SRM.  Measurements should be made near the center of the wafer. 
 
Storage and Handling:  Silicon is typically inert under ambient and testing conditions.  The silicon wafer may be 
returned to wafer storage box and reused.  The wafer should not be dropped or similarly mechanically stressed.  
 
Coordination for this SRM was provided by E.C. Benck and R.J. Matyi of the NIST Atomic Physics Division. 
 
The  crystal  orientation  measurement  technique,  development,  and  certification  were  performed  by  E.C.  Benck  of 
the NIST Atomic Physics Division. 
 
Statistical analysis was performed by B. Toman of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division. 
 
The  support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Measurement 
Services Division.

Summary  of  Analytical  Method:    The  angular  measurements  were  made  using  a  high  resolution  double  crystal 
X ray diffractometer.  The diffractometer utilizes a nominal non-dispersive geometry with a fixed first crystal; for 
this work, a (004) reflection from a highly perfect silicon reference crystal is used.  The sample crystal is mounted 
on an Ultradex1 precision indexing table that is in turn mounted on a high precision rotation spindle that is driven 
by  a  stepper  motor  and  non-rotating  micrometer  via  a  sine  arm.    The  inclusion  of  the  Ultradex  table  allows  the 
sample to be indexed in 1° increments for large excursions while leaving the sine arm drive (total angular range of 
approximately ± 3°) for precision movements. 
 
Attached  to  the  sample  rotation  spindle  is  a  polarization-encoded  optical  angle  interferometer  that  employs  a 
calibrated (NIST-traceable) He-Ne laser source.  Measurements of angle were performed by counting interference 
fringes,  with  a  calibration  relating  fringes  to  angle  increment  having  been  established  by  conventional  angle 
metrology methods.  Since the wavelength of the interferometer is traceable to the SI, the measurements of angular 
misorientation are as well.  

The following measurement procedure was used for each of the silicon wafers in the production run: 

1.  The wafers were used as supplied by the vendor, with no additional preparation. 
vendor,  with  no  additional  preparation.

2.  The sample was mounted on a precision rotation axis (φ-axis) with the wafer flat parallel to the plane of 
dispersion.  The sample and φ-axis are mounted on the sample rotation or ω-axis of a double crystal X-ray 
diffractometer.  The X-ray beam nominally samples the center of the wafer.  The ω-axis is perpendicular to 
the X-ray plane of dispersion; the rotation of this axis will be calibrated using circle closure with an optical 
polygon and a precision-nulling autocollimator.  Angles were measured using a polarization-encoded angle 
interferometer.  These attributes (closure calibration and angle measurement with an angle interferometer 
with calibrated laser) ensure traceability to the SI. 

3.  The sample surface was aligned with respect to a two-axis electronic autocollimator.  The sample surface 
was made perpendicular to the autocollimator to a precision of better than 2 × 10-4 radians (i.e., better than 
4 angular seconds).  The angle in the plane of dispersion corresponding to the crystal being aligned with 
the  autocollimator  is  determined  from  a  linear  least  squares  fit  to  a  series  of  the  autocollimator  signal 
versus angle measurements. 

4.  The  (004)  silicon  reflection  from  the  wafer  was  recorded  with  CuKα1  radiation  monochromated  by  a 
highly perfect Si reference crystal.  The angle was determined by a center-of-mass calculation of the X-ray 
detector signal and angle measurements.  The difference angle between the autocollimator signal and the  
X-ray reflection was calculated. 

5.  The sample was rotated 180° about the φ-axis.  Steps (3) and (4) were repeated in order to determine the 

surface normal and reflection angles from which the difference angle was calculated. 

6.  The  difference  angle  between  the  autocollimator  and  the  X-ray  reflection  determined  in  (4)  and  (5)  was 
summed,  and  one  half  of  this  value  is  the  wafer  misorientation  with  respect  to the  surface  about  an  axis 
perpendicular to the wafer flat. 

7.  The sample was rotated 90° to orient the wafer flat perpendicular to the plane of dispersion. 
8.  Steps (3), (4), and (5) were repeated. 
9.  The difference angles between the autocollimator and the X-ray reflection determined in (8) were summed, 
and one half of this value is the wafer misorientation with respect to the surface about an axis parallel to 
the wafer flat. 

 

 

                                                           

1 Certain commercial equipment, instruments, or materials are identified in this certificate to adequately describe the 
experimental  procedure.  Such  identification  does  not  imply  recommendation  or  endorsement  by  the  National  Institute  of 
Standards and Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment are the best available for the purpose.

Misalignment of the sample normal:  Misalignment of the sample normal out of the plane of the diffractometer by 
an amount φ leads to a tilt error Δθ = (φ2/2)tanθ. The fact that the error depends on the square of the misorientation 
means that as the sample is rotated 180° about the φ-axis, the apparent shift in the diffracted peak position will be 
the same (θ + Δθ); so by taking the difference, the tilt error cancels out. 
 
Misalignment of the φ-axis:  Realignment of the wafer with respect to the autocollimator after each rotation about 
the  φ-axis  results  in  the  errors  due  to  misalignment  of  the  φ-axis  from  the  plane  of  the  diffractometer  to  be 
negligible. 
  
Mounting  Misalignment:    Error  in  aligning  the  major  flat  to  the  diffractometer  plane  results  in  an  error  in  the 
direction of the crystal misorientation, but not the overall magnitude. Although care was taken to remove any dust 
or debris from the wafer and the mounting bar, there always is the possibility of dust causing the wafer flat to be 
misaligned.  In  addition,  there  is  the  possibility  of  the  wafer  support  itself  being  misaligned  relative  to  the 
diffractometer  plane  resulting  in  a  systematic  error.  Consequently,  we  estimate  that  the  absolute  accuracy  of  the 
wafer alignment to be better than 20 angular seconds. For the magnitude of angles being measured, this corresponds 
to an uncertainty of 0.15 angular seconds. 
 
Angular  Rotation  about  the  φ-axis:    Errors  in  the  angular  positioning  about  the  φ-axis  results  in  the  most 
significant  uncertainty  in  the  crystal  orientation  measurements.  The  angular  positioning  of  the  φ-axis  bearing  is 
determined  by  a  set  of  interlocking  gear  teeth.  Based  on  the  manufacturer’s  specifications,  the  angular  accuracy 
should be better than 4 angular minutes. Consequently, for the magnitude of angles being measured, the maximum 
systematic uncertainty due to of any measured angles is 1.4 angular seconds.  
 
Peak  Assignment:    Error  in  the  peak  assignment  due  to  statistical  noise  is  not  a  significant  source  of  error.  The 
intensity of the X-ray beam was maintained to produce reasonable signal-to-noise ratios. Repeat measurements of 
the same rocking curve without moving the φ-axis bearing result in the same angle measurement to within 0.1 arc 
seconds. 
 
Measurement  Repeatability:    The  statistical  measurement  uncertainties  of  SRM  1994  were  determined  from 
repeated measurements of three wafers selected from the production run.  Based on the statistical measurements, an 
expanded uncertainty at the 95 % level of confidence was determined to be below 4 arc seconds.   
 
Certification  and  Uncertainties:    The  statistical  uncertainty  (type  A)  has  been  combined  with  the  maximum 
systematic error (type B) in quadrature to determine an overall error for all wafers of 4.2 arc seconds. The certified 
crystal orientations are listed in Table 2 [1].
