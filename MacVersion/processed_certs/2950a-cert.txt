Respirable Alpha Quartz on Filter Media 
 
(Nominal Mass of Alpha Quartz: 5 µg – 500 µg) 
 
This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  the  calibration  of  X-ray  diffraction (XRD) 
spectrometers for the determination of respirable alpha quartz using National Institute for Occupational Safety and 
Health (NIOSH)  Method  7500 [1],  or  the  equivalent  (see  “Instructions  for  Storage  and  Use”).    The  SRM  was 
produced by depositing a known amount of SRM 1878a Respirable Alpha Quartz, as a slurry on a 25 mm diameter 
polyvinyl chloride (PVC) filter.  A unit of SRM 2950a consists of 35 blank PVC filters containing no alpha quartz 
and  5 loaded  PVC  filters  at  each  of  the  following  nominal  levels:  5 μg,  10 μg,  20 μg,  50 μg,  100 μg,  250 μg,  and 
500 μg.  The blank filters are stored in seven petri dishes each containing five filters.  The loaded filters are stored in 
seven petri dishes each containing five filters of the nominal level. 
 
Certified Mass of Alpha-Quartz on Filter:  The certified mass of alpha quartz on each filter, provided in Table 1, 
is based on results obtained from the gravimetric preparation of the filters and from the determination of silicon by 
inductively  coupled  plasma  optical  emission  spectrometry (ICP–OES) [2,3].    The  results  are  expressed  as  the 
certified value ± the expanded uncertainty [4].  The gravimetric preparation value of the alpha quartz mass per filter 
was calculated as the average mass of SRM 1878a on each filter multiplied by the certified mass fraction of alpha 
quartz in SRM 1878a.  The ICP–OES value for alpha quartz mass per filter was calculated from the determined mass 
of silicon per filter, the determined mass fraction of silicon in SRM 1878a, and the certified mass fraction of alpha 
quartz in SRM 1878a [3]. 
 
Certified Values:  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in 
that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [4].  The certified value is 
the  unweighted  average  of  the  masses  determined  by  gravimetric  and  ICP-OES  measurements.    The  expanded 
uncertainty  is  calculated  as  U = kuc,  where  uc  is  intended  to  represent,  at  the  level  of  one  standard  deviation,  the 
combined  uncertainty  due  to  material  variability  and  measurement  uncertainty  calculated  according  to  the  method 
described  in  the  ISO/JCGM  and  NIST  Guides [5].    The  coverage  factor,  k,  is  determined  from  the  Student’s 
t-distribution corresponding to the calculated effective degrees of freedom at 95 % level of confidence. 
 
Expiration  of  Certification:    The  certification  of  SRM 2950a  is  valid,  within  the  measurement  uncertainty 
specified, until 30 June 2022, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given in 
this  certificate  (see  “Instructions  for  Storage  and  Use”).    The  certification  is  nullified  if  the  SRM  is  damaged, 
contaminated, or modified.  
 
Maintenance  of  SRM  Certification:    NIST  will  monitor  this  SRM  over  the  period  of  its  certification.    If 
substantive  technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will 
notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Coordination  of  the  technical  measurements  leading  to  the  certification  was  under  the  direction  of  L.L. Yu  of  the 
NIST Chemical Sciences Division. 
 
Analytical measurements were performed at NIST by L.L. Yu.   
 
mgineering  Division. 
Statistical consultation was provided by W.F. Guthrie of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division.

Support for the preparation and certification of this SRM was provided by NIOSH. 
 
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Office  of  Reference 
Materials. 
 
Traceability:    The  measurand  is  the  total  mass  per  filter  of  alpha  quartz  and  the  certified  value  is  metrologically 
traceable to the SI unit of mass, expressed as micrograms.

STORAGE  AND  USE 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE AND USE 
 
Storage:  Sealed filters, as received, should be stored in the dark at temperatures between 15 °C and 25 °C.  
 
‘or
Use:  This SRM was developed for use with NIOSH Method 7500 [1].  Sample preparation for this method calls for 
filters  to  either  be  ashed  or  dissolved  in  tetrahydrofuran  prior to XRD measurements.  The ashing option must be 
used with this SRM rather than dissolution.  This SRM may also be used for NIOSH Methods 7602 [1] and 7603 [1], 
and Quartz Analytical Method (P-7) [6] using infrared absorption spectrometry. 
 
NOTICE AND WARNING TO USERS 
 
This  material  contains  respirable  alpha  quartz  that  is  known  to  cause  silicosis.    It  must  be  handled  with  care  and 
disposed of according to federal, state and local regulations.  See Safety Data Sheet.  
 
Cooperating  Laboratory(1):    The  materials  for  this  SRM  were  prepared  at  High  Purity  Standards, Inc. 
(Charleston, SC).
