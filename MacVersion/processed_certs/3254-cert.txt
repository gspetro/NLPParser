SRM 

 
This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  use  in  validating  analytical  methods  for  the 
determination of catechins, xanthines and elements in the leaves of green tea (Camellia sinensis) and similar matrices.  
This  SRM  has 
SRM 3254 can also be used for quality assurance when assigning values to in-house control materials.  This SRM has 
also  been  characterized  for  its  DNA  sequence.    A  unit  of  SRM 3254  consists  of  five  packets,  each  containing 
approximately 3 g of leaf powder. 
 
The  development  of  SRM 3254  was  a  collaboration  among 
the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and 
Technology (NIST), the National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements (NIH-ODS), and the Food and 
Drug Administration Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (FDA CDER).  The addition of genetic information 
was  accomplished  through  collaboration  among  NIST,  NIH-ODS,  the  U.S.  Department  of  Agriculture (USDA) 
Agricultural Research Service (ARS), AuthenTechnologies (Richmond, CA), and American Herbal Pharmacopoeia 
(Scotts Valley, CA). 
 
Taxonomic  Identification:    The  taxonomic  identity  is  Camellia sinensis,  established  through  identification  by  a 
trained botanist using an herbarium specimen from original material and from associated DNA sequence analysis from 
botanically  authenticated  Camellia sinensis.    The  associated  DNA  sequences  are  available  in  companion 
FASTA-formatted  files [1].    The  uncertainty  associated  with  each  nucleotide  in  the  sequence,  and  in  turn  the 
uncertainty  associated  with  the  DNA  sequence  as  an  identifier  of  species,  is  expressed  in  an  ordinal  scale  that 
represents the confidence estimates of the assigned value (Tables 1 and 2) [2].  These DNA sequences are used as a 
source of identity data for Camellia sinensis.   
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values:  Certified mass fraction values of catechins, xanthines, and elements in SRM 3254, 
reported on a dry-mass basis, are provided in Tables 3 and 4.  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has 
the highest confidence in its accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken 
into account [3].  Analyses for value assignment were performed by NIST and collaborating laboratories.  Certified 
values of catechins and xanthines are the equally weighted means of the individual sets of results; certified values for 
elements were calculated as the mean of the mean values from NIST methods and the median of the means of results 
provided  by  collaborating  laboratories,  where  appropriate.    The  associated  uncertainties  are  expressed  at  an 
approximately 95 % level of confidence [4-6].   
 
Reference Mass Fraction Values:  Reference mass fraction values for catechin, gallocatechin, gallic acid, theanine, 
and additional elements in SRM 3254, reported on a dry-mass basis, are provided in Tables 5 and 6.  A NIST reference 
value is a noncertified value that is the best estimate of the true value based on available data; however, the values do 
not meet the NIST criteria for certification [1] and are provided with associated uncertainties that may reflect only 
measurement reproducibility, may not include all sources of uncertainty, or may reflect a lack of sufficient statistical 
agreement among multiple analytical methods.  The reference mass fraction values were derived from results reported 
by NIST or collaborating laboratories. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 3254 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until  30 June 2027,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  given  in  this 
certificate (see “Instructions for Storage and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, 
or otherwise modified.

NOTICE TO USERS: SRM 3254 IS INTENDED FOR RESEARCH USE; NOT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. 
 
aE  AND  USE 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE AND USE 
 
Storage:  The SRM should be stored at controlled room temperature (20 °C to 25 °C), in the original packet, until needed.  
For elemental analyses, the packet can be re-sealed and test portions removed and analyzed until the material reaches 
its expiration date.  The stability of catechins, xanthines, and theanine in opened packets has not been investigated.  
 
Use:  Before use, the contents of a packet of material should be mixed thoroughly.  To relate analytical determinations 
to the certified values in this Certificate of Analysis, the test portion mass indicated in the description of the NIST 
analyses for each group of analytes below should be used (see “Source, Preparation, and Analysis”).  Test portions 
should be analyzed as received and results converted to a dry-mass basis by determining moisture content (described 
below)  on  a  separate  test  portion.    The  moisture  conversion  factor  can  be  used  for  the  sample(s)  when  using  an 
unopened packet for the first time. If using a previously opened and resealed packet, moisture must be determined 
using one of the recommended techniques (see “Determination of Moisture”).  Analytical results should include their 
own estimates of uncertainty and can be compared to the certified and reference values using procedures described in 
reference 7. 
 
Determination of Moisture:  Moisture content of SRM 3254 was determined at NIST by (1) freeze-drying to constant 
mass over 7 days; (2) drying over magnesium perchlorate in a desiccator at room temperature for 28 d; and (3) drying 
for  2 h  in  a  forced-air  oven  at  80 °C.    Unweighted  results  obtained  using  all  three  techniques  were  averaged  to 
determine a conversion factor of (0.9481 ± 0.0029) gram dry-mass per gram as-received mass,  which  was used to 
convert data from an as-received to a dry-mass basis; the uncertainty shown on this value is an expanded uncertainty 
(k = 2) to represent a 95 % level of confidence.  An uncertainty component for the conversion factor (0.14 %) obtained 
from the moisture measurements is incorporated in the uncertainties of the certified and reference values, reported on 
a dry-mass basis, that are provided in this certificate.

SOURCE, PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Source and Preparation:  The material for production of SRM 3254 was received as nominally 250 µm (60 mesh) 
particles and was further ground and sieved at NIST to 180 µm (80 mesh).  The sieved material was transferred to 
High-Purity Standards (Charleston, SC) where it was blended, aliquoted, and heat-sealed inside nitrogen-flushed 4 mil 
polyethylene bags, which were then sealed inside nitrogen-flushed aluminized plastic bags along with two packets of 
silica  gel  each.    Following  packaging,  SRM 3254  was  irradiated  (Neutron Products, Inc.,  Dickerson, MD)  to  an 
absorbed dose of 7.9 kGy to 9.5 kGy. 
 
Analytical Approach for Determination of Catechins, Gallic Acid, Xanthines, and Theanine:  Value assignment 
of  the  mass  fractions  of  the  catechins,  gallic  acid,  and  xanthines  in  SRM 3254  was  based  on  the  combination  of 
measurements provided by NIST using liquid chromatography (LC) with ultraviolet absorbance detection (UV) and 
LC  with  mass  spectrometry (MS),  and  by  data  provided  by  collaborating  laboratories  using  LC  with  fluorescence 
detection (LC/FL) and LC/UV.  NIST provided theanine measurements using LC/MS. 
 
NIST Analyses for Catechins, Gallic Acid, and Xanthines using LC/UV: The mass fractions of catechins, gallic acid, 
caffeine and theobromine were measured by LC/UV in 100 mg to 400 mg test portions taken from each of six packets 
of  SRM 3254.    Test  portions  were  combined  with  diatomaceous  earth  (Hydromatrix, Isco, Lincoln, NE), 
7-(β-Hydroxypropyl) theophylline (proxyphylline) as an internal standard, ethylenediaminetetracetic acid (EDTA), 
carbohydrases, and cellulase in polypropylene tubes.  The samples were placed in a heated ultrasonicating bath for 
6 h.    A  proteinase  was  then  added  and  the  samples  were  incubated  and  centrifuged.    Filtrates  were  extracted  into 
acetone and water (20 % and 80 % volume fractions, respectively) using pressurized-fluid extraction.  Samples were 
analyzed by using LC/UV with a C18 column and absorbance detection at 210 nm.  A typical separation is provided 
in Figure C1 (Appendix C).  Calibrants were prepared gravimetrically, and a single internal standard solution was used 
for the calibrants and samples.  A series of three calibrants containing varying analyte levels was used. 
 
were  measured  by  LC/UV 
NIST Analyses for Catechins using LC/UV and LC/MS:  The mass fractions of catechins were measured by LC/UV 
and LC/MS in duplicate 90 mg test portions taken from each of six packets of SRM 3254.  Test portions were combined 
with proxyphylline (internal standard) and extracted by ultrasonic agitation for 90 min.  The extraction process was 
repeated using fresh solvent, and supernatants were combined.  Supernatants were syringe-filtered prior to analysis by 
using LC/UV and LC/MS.  A C18 column was used with an absorbance detection at 280 nm and a mass spectrometer 
with electrospray ionization source (ESI) connected in series.  Selected ion monitoring was used for quantitation at 
m/z 171  for  gallic  acid (GA),  m/z 239  for  proxyphylline  (internal  standard),  m/z 291  for  catechin (C)  and 
epicatechin (EC), m/z 307 for gallocatechin (GC) and epigallocatechin (EGC), m/z 443 for epicatechin gallate (ECG), 
and m/z 459 for gallocatechin gallate (GCG) and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG).  A typical separation is provided 
in Figure C1 (Appendix C).  Calibrants were prepared gravimetrically, and a single internal standard solution was used 
for the calibrants and samples.  A series of four calibrants were prepared at levels approximating the values expected 
in the SRM. 
 
NIST Analyses for Xanthines using LC/MS:  The mass fractions of caffeine, theophylline, theobromine, and theanine 
1€ 
were measured by LC/MS in duplicate 0.07 g to 0.1 g test portions taken from each of six packets of SRM 3254.  Test 
portions were combined with internal standard solutions containing trimethyl-13C3-caffeine and 13C15N2-theophylline, 
methanol, and  water or  2H6-theobromine and  2H5-L-theanine,  methanol, and phosphate  buffer in  water.  Materials 
Is 
were  extracted  using  ultrasonic  agitation  for  2 h.    Samples  were  syringe-filtered  prior  to  LC/MS  analysis.    A 
C18 column and ESI in positive polarity were used, and ions at m/z 198 for labeled caffeine, m/z 195 for caffeine, 
m/z 184 for labeled theophylline, m/z 181 for theophylline, m/z 187 for labeled theobromine, m/z 181 for theobromine, 
m/z 180 for labeled theanine, and m/z 175 for theanine were monitored.  Calibrants were prepared gravimetrically, at 
at
levels intended to approximate the levels of the xanthines in the SRM.  A single internal standard solution was used 
for the calibrants and samples.  
 
Analyses for Elements:  For analytes that were measured by NIST, duplicate 0.5 g test portions from a single packet 
of SRM 3255 were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).  Samples were digested 
in a microwave sample preparation system using HNO3 and HF.  The GMA FIACC laboratories prepared samples 
using  a  microwave  sample  preparation  system  with  analyses  by  either  ICP-MS  or  atomic  absorption 
spectroscopy (AAS).  
 

                                                 

(1)  Certain commercial equipment, instrumentation, or materials are identified in this certificate to adequately specify the 
experimental  procedure.    Such  identification  does  not  imply  recommendation  or  endorsement  by  the  National  Institutes  of 
Standards and Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the 
purpose.

Collaborating Laboratories’ Analyses:  Hershey Foods analyzed 250 mg test portions from each of six packets for 
catechin, epicatechin, caffeine, and theobromine using sonication, and analyzed extracts by using LC/FL (catechins) 
or LC/UV at 280 nm (xanthines).  Tampa Bay Analytical Research analyzed 150 mg test portions in triplicate from 
each of five packets for catechins and caffeine using sonication.  Extracts were analyzed by using LC/UV.  The GMA 
FIACC laboratories were asked to use their usual methods to make single measurements of elements on test portions 
taken  from  each  of  two  packets  of  SRM 3254.    Because  of  variability  among  data  provided  by  laboratories 
participating in an interlaboratory comparison exercise, the median of laboratory means was used, with the uncertainty 
estimated using the median absolute deviation (MADe) [8]. 
 
ASSIGNMENT OF IDENTITY 
 
Molecular Approach for Species Identity:  Sanger sequencing was used on two independent chloroplast gene regions, 
psbA-trnH  intergenic  region [9,10],  and  the  nuclear  ribosomal  gene  internal  transcribed  spacer (ITS)  sequence  for 
authentication of SRM 3254.  Complete sequencing of the strands of DNA for the two gene regions was performed 
on triplicate samples, the sequence reads were independently hand-curated, and the confidence values were estimated 
as described below.  DNA sequences are available in companion FASTA-formatted files [1].  To certify the species 
identity,  validation  studies  were  performed  based  on  the  “Probability  of  Identification (POI)”  model  using  an 
Inclusivity  and  Exclusivity  Panel [11].    Multiple  samples  of  authenticated  herbarium  vouchers,  botanical  identity 
reference materials, and published literature were used to comprise the panels from the target and most closely related 
species (see Appendix A for more information on the reference samples).  These samples were analyzed a minimum 
of ten times to ensure consistency in methods from replicate to replicate.  Maximum Likelihood (ML) phylogenetic 
analyses  were  performed  using  the  phylogenetic  estimation  using  ML (PhyML)  algorithm,  with  a  General  Time 
Reversible (GTR)  substitution  model,  a  fixed  transition-transversion  ratio,  and  1,000 bootstrap  replicates.    ML 
phylogenies, and the DNA aligned matrices, which can be found in Appendix B, were used to determine the species 
identity of SRM 3254 and to estimate the confidence (as described below).  The confidence level for the psbA-trnH 
intergenic region was “Ambiguous” (3). 
 
The taxonomic identification is Camellia sinensis and the associated chloroplast DNA sequences from the psbA-trnH 
intergenic  spacer  and  from  the  nuclear  ribosomal  gene  internal  transcribed  spacer  (ITS) sequence  are  available  in 
companion FASTA-formatted files [1].  The confidence associated with each nucleotide in the sequence, and in turn 
the confidence associated  with the DNA sequence as an identifier of species, is expressed in an ordinal scale that 
represents the strength of the belief in the assigned value (Table 1) [2].  In the absence of a fully developed metrology 
for identity, these DNA sequences are used as a source of identity data for Camellia sinensis.  Chloroplast and nuclear 
ribosomal DNA sequences from botanically authenticated Camellia sinensis samples are used to establish inclusivity; 
chloroplast and nuclear ribosomal DNA sequences from close relatives are used to establish exclusivity. 
 
Nucleotide  Identity:    A  set  of  heuristic,  experience-based,  rules  (see  Table 2)  were  used  to  establish  confidence 
estimates for the nucleotides comprising the DNA sequences obtained from SRM 3254, and their use in identifying 
the  species  (see  Table  1).    The  DNA  sequences  with  curated  confidence  estimates  are  available  in  companion 
FASTA-formatted  files [1].   The  DNA  aligned  matrix  used  to determine  the  species  identity  and  their  confidence 
estimates are provided in Appendix B.  The confidence associated with each nucleotide in the sequence in the FASTA 
files provided [1], and in turn the confidence associated with the DNA sequence as an identifier of species, is expressed 
in an ordinal scale that represents the strength of the belief in the  assigned value (Table 2) [2].  Characteristics of 
sequence  data  and  phylogenetic  data  used  for  species  identity  associated  with  the  levels  of  the  ordinal  scale  are 
described  in  Tables 1  and 2.    The  confidence  estimates  for  the  psbA-trnH  and  ITS  sequences  are  available  in 
companion FASTA-formatted files [1].

Homogeneity Assessment:  The homogeneity of catechins, xanthines, and theanine was assessed at NIST by using 
stically  significant 
the  LC/UV  and  LC/MS  methods  described  above.    Analysis  of  variance  did  not  show  statistically  significant 
heterogeneity  at  an  approximately  95 %  level  of  confidence.    Other  analytes  have  been  treated  as  though  they  are 
homogeneously distributed in the material although the homogeneity of only the catechins, xanthines, and theanine 
was assessed. 
 
equally  weighted
Value Assignment:  For calculation of assigned values for catechins, xanthines, and theanine, the equally weighted 
mean of results provided by NIST, and the individual means of collaborating laboratories’ data, where available, were 
used to calculate assigned values.  In cases where data were provided using two detectors in series, the average was 
treated as a single method mean when it was combined with other data.  The GMA FIACC laboratories reported the 
individual  results  for  each  of  their  analyses  for  a  given  analyte.    The  mean  of  each  laboratory’s  results  was  then 
determined.  For calculation of assigned values for analytes that were measured only by the collaborating laboratories, 
the  median of  the laboratory  means  was  used.   For analytes that  were also  measured by NIST, the  median of the 
individual  collaborating  laboratory  means  and  the  mean  of  the  individual  sets  of  NIST  data  were  averaged,  as 
appropriate.

fraction for each element listed in Table 6, on a dry-mass basis, as determined by the method indicated.  Metrological 
traceability is to mass fraction (expressed as milligrams per kilogram) as realized by the method used.

Figure B1. psbA-trnH DNA Aligned Matrix for Camellia sinensis and Relatives. The results from the chloroplast region 
demonstrates that this region does distinguish this species from its relatives and does authenticate Camellia sinensis. The 
individual bases are represented as A = Adenine, T = Thymine, G = Guanine, C= Cystosine, and U = Uracil. Polymorphic 
bases are represented by standard IUPAC codes with R = A/G, W = A/T, M = A/c, Y = C/T, S = G/C, K = G/T, and N = 
missing data. The confidence estimate for the species identification of SRM 3254 as Camellia sinensis is Ambiguous (3).

Figure C1.  Chromatograms showing separation of catechins, gallic acid, and caffeine using Catechin Method 1 (top) 
and  Catechin Method 2 (bottom).    For  Catechin Method 1,  an  Ace  C18  ultra  inert  column  (250 mm × 4.6 mm, 
5 µm particle size; MAC-MOD Analytical, Chadds Ford, PA) was held at 23 °C.  The separation was performed using 
a gradient consisting of water, acetonitrile, and methanol, each containing phosphoric acid.  The solvent composition 
reached  full  elution  strength  at  35 min.    Absorbance  detection  was  at  210 nm.    For  Catechin Method 2,  a 
Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C18 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 µm particle size; Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) was 
used.  The separation was performed using a gradient of water and acetonitrile, both containing 0.1 % formic acid 
(volume fraction).  Absorbance detection  was at 280 nm; data were also generated using MS  with ESI in positive 
polarity  in  series  with  the  absorbance  detector  (chromatograms  not  shown).    Abbreviations:    caffeine (Caf), 
catechin (C), epicatechin (EC), epicatechin gallate (ECG), epigallocatechin (EGC), epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), 
gallic  acid (GA),  gallocatechin (GC),  gallocatechin  gallate (GCG),  proxyphylline  (internal  standard;  IS),  and
