2. HAZARDS IDENTIFICATION

Radiological Hazard  

Warning:  THIS MATERIAL SHOULD ONLY BE USED BY PERSONS QUALIFIED TO HANDLE RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL!  

	This product contains licensed radioactive material and is therefore subject to the requirements of 10 CFR Part 20 (e.g., public and occupational exposure limits, waste disposal).  At a minimum, the basic radiation safety principles of time, distance, and shielding, and appropriate radiation contamination control should be practiced to avoid/minimize any external and/or internal exposure.  Consult with your Radiation Safety office for your facility’s radiation safety requirements/precautions specific to the radionuclide(s) (including its activity and chemical/physical form) in this Radioactive SRM.

	SRM 4415H is a radioactive material, Xenon-133, with a massic activity of approximately 12 GBq in nonradioactive xenon gas.  Xenon-133 decays by beta-particle emission to excited levels of Cs-133.  During the decay process, x-rays and gamma rays with energies from 3.8 keV to 384 keV are also emitted.

Classification 

	Physical Hazard:	There are no known physical hazards associated with this material.

		Health Hazard:	Not classified.

6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES

This material is radioactive.  Immediately notify safety personnel of a leak.

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment, Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:

Radiological Emergency Procedures:

The following is a guide for first responders.  The following actions, including remediation, should be carried out by qualified individuals.  In cases where a life-threatening injury occurs concurrent with personal contamination, treat the injury first.  

Do not touch damaged packages.  Handle as a radioactive material leak.  In addition to those actions described below, the guidelines in the Emergency Response Guidebook (ERG) provide more specific measures that should be followed.



In case of a breakage, evacuate the room closing the door behind you and contact safety personnel

7. HANDLING AND STORAGE
