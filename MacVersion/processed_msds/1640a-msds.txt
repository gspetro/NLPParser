1640a 
Trace Elements in Natural Water 

Recommended Use of This Material and Restrictions of Use 

This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended for use in evaluating methods used in the determination of 
trace  elements  in  fresh  water.    SRM 1640a  consists  of  acidified  spring  water  with  mass  fractions  and  mass 
concentrations assigned for 29 elements, 22 of which were gravimetrically added.  The solution contains nitric 
acid  at  a  volume  fraction  of  approximately  2 %.    A  unit  of  SRM 1640a  consists  of  250 mL  of  solution  in  a 
high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle sealed inside an aluminized Mylar pouch.

4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Description of First Aid Measures:  

Inhalation:    If  adverse  effects  occur,  remove  to  uncontaminated  area.    If  not  breathing,  give  artificial 
respiration or oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Skin Contact:  Wash skin with soap and water for at least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing 
and shoes.  Get immediate medical attention.  Thoroughly clean and dry contaminated clothing before reuse.  

Eye Contact:  Immediately flush eyes, including under the eyelids with copious amounts of water for at least 
15 minutes.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Ingestion:  Contact a poison control center immediately for instructions.  Give water to rinse out mouth.  Never 
give liquids to a person with reduced awareness or becoming unconscious.  If vomiting occurs, keep head lower 
than  hips  to  prevent  aspiration.    If  not  breathing,  give  artificial  respiration  by  qualified  personnel.    Seek 
immediate medical attention. 

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  Acid burns to skin, eyes, and lungs. 

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above 
symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention.   

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire  and  Explosion  Hazards:    Negligible  fire  hazard.    See  Section 9,  “Physical  and  Chemical  Properties”  for 
flammability properties. 

Extinguishing Media: 
 
 

Suitable:  Use extinguishing media appropriate to the surrounding fire. 
Unsuitable:  None listed. 

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  Thermal decomposition will form oxides of nitrogen. 

Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion 
byproducts.  Wear full protective clothing and NIOSH approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe)

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Personal  Precautions,  Protective  Equipment  and  Emergency  Procedures:    Immediately  contact  emergency 
personnel.    Keep  unnecessary  personnel  away.    Use  suitable  protective  equipment;  see  Section  8,  “Exposure 
Controls and Personal Protection”.  

Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Do not touch spilled material.  Notify safety personnel 
of spills.  Absorb with sand or other non-combustible material.  Collect spilled material in appropriate container for 
disposal.  Isolate hazard area and deny entry.   

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Safe Handling Precautions:  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.   

Storage:    Store  and  handling  in  accordance  with  all  current  regulations  and  standards.    Keep  separated  from 
incompatible substances (see Section 10, “Stability and Reactivity”).

10 mg/m3 (4 ppm; STEL) 
5 mg/m3 (2 ppm; TWA) 

Engineering Controls:   Provide  local  exhaust  or  process  enclosure  ventilation  system.  Ensure  compliance  with 
applicable exposure limits. 

Personal Protection:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal Protective 
Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material. 

Respiratory Protection:    If workplace conditions warrant a respirator, a respiratory protection program that meets 
OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.   Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators. 

Eye/Face  Protection:    Wear  splash  resistant  safety  goggles  with  a  face  shield.    An  eye  wash  station  should  be 
readily available near areas of use. 

Skin  and  Body  Protection:    Personal  protective  equipment  for  the  body  should  be  selected  based  on  the  task 
being  performed  and  the  risks  involved  and  should  be  approved  by  a  specialist  before  handling  this  product.  
Chemical-resistant gloves should be worn at all times when handling chemicals.
