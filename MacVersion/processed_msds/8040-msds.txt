8.  EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

Exposure Limits:  No occupational exposure limits have been established.  The exposure limits for Particulates Not 
Otherwise Regulated are applicable. 

OSHA (PEL):  15 mg/m3 (TWA, total particulates) 
 

5 mg/m3 (TWA, respirable particulates) 

Engineering Controls:   Provide  local  exhaust  or  process  enclosure  ventilation  system.  Ensure  compliance  with 
applicable exposure limits. 

Personal Protection:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal Protective 
Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material. 

Respiratory Protection:    If workplace conditions warrant a respirator, a respiratory protection program that 
meets  OSHA 29CFR  1910.134  must  be  followed.    Refer  to  NIOSH  42  CFR  84  for  applicable certified 
respirators. 

Eye/Face Protection:  Wear splash resistant safety goggles with a face shield.  An eye wash station should 
be readily available near areas of use. 

Skin and Body Protection:  Personal protective equipment for the body should be selected based on the 
task being performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a specialist before handling this 
product.  Chemical-resistant gloves should be worn at all times when handling chemicals.

Ingestion 

Symptoms  Related  to  the  Physical,  Chemical  and  Toxicological  Characteristics:    Skin,  eye,  and  possible 
respiratory irritation.  

Potential Health Effects (Acute, Chronic and Delayed): 

Inhalation:  Inhalation of dust may cause irritation of the mucous membranes.  No data available for chronic 
exposure. 

Skin Contact:  Exposure to dust may result in irritation.  Solutions of sodium oxalate may be absorbed through 
the  skin  causing  hypocalcemia  and  renal  impairment.    Prolonged  immersion  of  the  hands  in  sodium  oxalate 
solutions has resulted in gangrene due to absorption. 

Eye  Contact:    Depending  on  concentration  and  duration  of  exposure,  sodium  oxalate  dust  may  cause  eye 
irritation with redness and pain.  Repeated or prolonged contact may result in the same effects as acute exposure. 

Ingestion:  Ingestion of this material is unlikely under normal conditions of use.  If ingested, gastrointestinal 
irritation and possible burns to the mouth and stomach may result.  Large doses of dilute solutions may result in 
renal failure.  Chronic ingestion of oxalates may result in urinary calculi.
