Warning:    THIS  MATERIAL  SHOULD  ONLY  BE  USED  BY  PERSONS  QUALIFIED  TO  HANDLE 
RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL!   

This product contains licensed radioactive material and is therefore subject to the requirements of 10 CFR Part 20 
(e.g., public and occupational exposure limits, waste disposal).  At a minimum, the basic radiation safety principles 
of  time,  distance,  and  shielding,  and  appropriate  radiation  contamination  control  should  be  practiced  to 
avoid/minimize any external and/or internal exposure.  Consult with your Radiation Safety office for your facility’s 
radiation safety requirements/precautions specific to the radionuclide(s) (including its activity and chemical/physical 
form) in this Radioactive SRM. 

SRM 4427L  is  a  radioactive  material,  yttrium-90,  with  a  total  activity  of  approximately  5 MBq  in  a 
hydrochloric acid solution.  Yttrium-90 decays by beta-particle emission.  During the decay process, X-Rays 
and  gamma  rays  with  energies  from  approximately  2 keV  to  2.2 MeV  are  emitted.    In  addition,  the  beta 
particles emitted from yttrium-90 produce bremsstrahlung photons with energies up to 2.3 MeV.  THIS SRM 
SHOULD ONLY BE USED BY PERSONS QUALIFIED TO HANDLE RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL!

4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Description of First Aid Measures:  

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration 
or oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention.
