2207 
Controlled Pore Glass - BET Specific Surface Area (Nominal Pore Diameter 18 nm) 

Recommended Use of This Material and Restrictions of Use 

This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended for the calibration and performance testing of instruments 
used  for  the  determination  of  the  Brunauer-Emmett-Teller  (BET)  specific  surface  area  (SSA)  by  the  static 
volumetric gas sorption technique.  A unit of SRM 2207 consists of one bottle containing approximately 5.1 g of 
high-purity granulated controlled-pore glass with a nominal pore diameter of 18 nm.

4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Description of First Aid Measures:  

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  Give artificial respiration if not breathing.  
Get immediate medical attention. 

Skin Contact:  Wash skin with soap and water for at least 15 minutes.  If necessary, seek medical attention. 

Eye Contact:  Flush eyes with water for at least 15 minutes.  If necessary, seek medical attention. 

Ingestion:  If a large amount is swallowed, get medical attention. 

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  Generated dust may cause mechanical irritation. 

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above 
symptoms are present, seek medical attention if needed. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Negligible fire hazard.  Avoid generating dust.  See Section 9, “Physical and Chemical 
Properties” for flammability properties. 
Extinguishing Media 

Suitable:  Use extinguishing media appropriate to surrounding fire. 
Unsuitable:  None listed. 

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  Not applicable. 
Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Move container from fire area if it can be done 
without personal risk.  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion by-products.  Wear full protective clothing and 
NIOSH-approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe) 
 

Reactivity = 0 

Health = 1 

Fire = 0 

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Any accumulated material on surfaces 
should be removed and properly disposed of.  Use suitable protective equipment; see Section 8, “Exposure Controls 
and Personal Protection”. 
Methods  and  Materials  for  Containment  and  Clean  up:    Collect  spilled  material  in  appropriate  container  for 
disposal.  Avoid generating dust. 

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Safe Handling Precautions:  Use suitable personal protection equipment (PPE).  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls 
and Personal Protection”. 
Storage and Incompatible Materials:  Store and handle in accordance with all current regulations and standards.  
Keep separated from incompatible substances (see Section 10, “Stability and Reactivity”). 

8.  EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

Exposure  Limits:    No  occupational  exposure  limits  have  been  established  for  glass  powder.    This  material  is  a 
particulate matter and adequate inhalation/respiratory protection should be used to minimize exposure.  The exposure 
limits for Particulates Not Otherwise Regulated are applicable. 

OSHA (PEL): 
 

15 mg/m3 (TWA, total particulates) 
5 mg/m3 (TWA, respirable particulates) 

NIOSH (REL): 
 
ACGIH (TLV): 

10 mg/m3 (TWA, total particulates) 
5 mg/m3 (TWA, respirable particulates) 
  No occupational exposure limits established. 

Engineering Controls:   Provide  local  exhaust  or  process  enclosure  ventilation  system.  Ensure  compliance  with 
applicable exposure limits.

Personal Protection Measures:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate PPE to 
minimize exposure to this material. 

Respiratory  Protection:    If workplace conditions warrant a  respirator, a  respiratory protection program that 
meets OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.   Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators. 

Eye/Face Protection:  Eye and face protection is required when dust is generated.  Wear splash resistant safety 
goggles.  Provide an emergency eye wash fountain and quick drench shower in the immediate work area. 

Skin and Body Protection:  Standard PPE is recommended to avoid irritation.
