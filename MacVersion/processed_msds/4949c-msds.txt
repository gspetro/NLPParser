Description:  This Standard Reference Material (SRM) consists of radioactive Iodine-129 as sodium iodide, sodium 
hydroxide, and sodium sulphite dissolved in 5 mL of  distilled  water.  This SRM is intended for the calibration of 
beta-particle instruments and for the monitoring of radiochemical procedures. 

Substance:  Iodine-129/sodium hydroxide/sodium iodide/sodium sulphite, solution 

  Water/sodium hydroxide/sodium iodide/sodium sulphite solution:  Not applicable. 

Other Designations: 

Iodine-129:  Not applicable.

Fire =  0 

  Reactivity = 0 

Warning:    THIS  MATERIAL  SHOULD  ONLY  BE  USED  BY  PERSONS  QUALIFIED  TO  HANDLE 
RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL!   

This product contains licensed radioactive material and is therefore subject to the requirements of 10 CFR Part 20 
(e.g., public and occupational exposure limits, waste disposal).  At a minimum, the basic radiation safety principles 
of  time,  distance,  and  shielding,  and  appropriate  radiation  contamination  control  should  be  practiced  to 
avoid/minimize any external and/or internal exposure.  Consult with your Radiation Safety office for your facility’s 
radiation safety requirements/precautions specific to the radionuclide(s) (including its activity and chemical/physical 
form) in this Radioactive SRM. 
 
SRM 4949c is a radioactive material, Iodine-129, with a massic activity of 3451 Bq•g-1 in a sodium hydroxide 
and sodium sulphite solution.  Iodine-129 decays by beta-particle emission.  During the decay process X-rays 
and gamma rays, with energies from 4 keV to 40 keV are emitted. 

Major  Health  Hazards: 

  There  are  no  major  chemical  health  hazards  associated  with  this  sodium 

hydroxide/sodium iodide/sodium sulphite solution due to the extremely low concentrations of each chemical. 

Physical Hazards: There are no known physical hazards associated with this material. 

Potential Health Effects 

Inhalation:  Not applicable. 

Skin  Contact:    Sodium  hydroxide  in  concentrations  ≥ 0.5 %  and  ≤ 2.0 %  are  classified  as  irritant.    Sodium 
iodide and sodium sulphite in their pure forms are classified as irritants.  The low concentrations in this solution 
are not expected to pose an irritation hazard. 

Eye Contact:  Sodium hydroxide in concentrations between 0.5 and 2.0 % are classified as an irritant. Sodium 
iodide and sodium sulphite in their pure forms are classified as irritants.  The low concentrations in this solution 
are not expected to pose an irritation hazard. 

Ingestion:    Ingestion  of  this  material  is  unlikely  under  normal  conditions  of  use.    If  ingested  seek  immediate 
medical attention.

4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration or 
oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Skin Contact:  Rinse affected area with copious amounts of water followed by washing with soap and water for at 
least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing.  Seek medical attention, if needed. 

Eye  Contact:    Immediately  flush  eyes,  including  under  the  eyelids  with  copious  amounts  of  water  for  at  least 
30 minutes.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Ingestion:  Contact a poison control center immediately for instructions.  Wash out mouth with water, but do not 
induce vomiting.  Seek medical aid at once, and bring the container or label. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Negligible fire hazard.

Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  

Radiological Emergency Procedures 
The following is a guide for first responders.  The following actions, including remediation, should be carried out by 
qualified individuals.  In cases where a life-threatening injury occurs concurrent with personal contamination, treat 
the injury first. 
Do  not  touch  damaged  packages  or  spilled  material.    Handle  as  a  radioactive  material  spill.    In  addition  to  those 
actions described below, the guidelines in the 2012 Emergency Response Guidebook (ERG) provide more specific
