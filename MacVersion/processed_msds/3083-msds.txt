Description:  This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is a solution of Aroclor 1242 (Chemical Abstracts Registry 
Number 53469-21-9) in methanol.  This SRM is intended primarily for calibrating chromatographic instrumentation 
and methods of analysis used for the determination of Aroclor 1242 and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in water.  
A unit of SRM 3083 consists of five 2 mL ampoules, each containing approximately 1.2 mL of solution.

2.  HAZARDS IDENTIFICATION 

NFPA Ratings (Scale 0–4):  Health = 2 
Fire = 3 
NOTE:    The  health  and  safety  information  included  in  this  MSDS  is  for  methanol,  the  main  component  of  this 
SRM.    The  concentration  of  Aroclor 1242  in  this  NIST  SRM  is  below  the  reportable  limits  for  hazardous 
components (1 %) and/or carcinogens (0.1 %), as required by OSHA, 29 CFR 1910.1200 (g)(2)(i)(C)(1), for MSDS 
information. 

Reactivity = 0 

Physical Hazards:  Flammable liquid and vapor. Vapor may cause flash fire. 

Major Health Hazards:  Skin irritation, eye irritation, central nervous system depression, nerve damage. 

Target Organ:  Nervous system. 

Potential Health Effects 

Inhalation: 
Acute exposure to methyl alcohol may cause irritation of the mucous membranes, coughing, oppression in the 
chest, tracheitis, bronchitis, tinnitus, unsteady gait, twitching, colic, constipation, nystagmus, and blepharospasm.  
Symptoms  from  occupational  exposure  include  paresthesias,  numbness  and  shooting  pains  in  the  hands  and 
forearms.  Metabolic acidosis, and effects on the eyes and central nervous system may occur as detailed in acute 
ingestion.  Chronic or prolonged exposure may cause effects as in acute ingestion, reproductive effects have been 
reported in animals.   
Skin Contact: 
Contact with methanol may cause irritation.  Skin absorption may occur and cause metabolic acidosis and effects 
on  the  eyes  and  central  nervous  system  as  detailed  in  acute  ingestion.    Repeated  or  prolonged  contact  with 
methanol  may  cause  defatting  of  the  skin  resulting  in  erythema,  scaling,  and  eczematoid  dermatitis.    Chronic 
absorption may result in metabolic acidosis and effects as detailed in acute ingestion. 
Eye Contact: 
Methanol vapors may cause irritation.  High concentrations have been reported to cause violent inflammation of 
the conjunctiva and epithelial defects on the cornea.  Mild irritation may occur with dilute solutions.  Chronic 
exposure may cause conjunctivitis.

Ingestion: 
Ingesting  methanol  may  cause  mild  and  transient  inebriation  and  subsequent  drowsiness  followed  by  an 
asymptomatic period lasting 8–48 hours.  Following the delay, coughing, dyspnea, headache, dullness, weakness, 
vertigo  or  dizziness,  nausea,  vomiting,  occasional  diarrhea,  anorexia,  violent  pain  in  the  back,  abdomen,  and 
extremities, restlessness, apathy or delirium, and rarely, excitement and mania may occur.  As little as 15 ml has 
caused blindness; the usual fatal dose is 60–240 ml.  Prolonged asthenia and irreversible effects on the nervous 
system  including  difficulty  in  speech,  motor  dysfunction  with  rigidity,  spasticity,  and  hypokinesis  have  been 
reported.  Repeated ingestion of methanol may cause visual impairment and blindness and other systemic effects 
as detailed in acute ingestion.  Reproductive effects have been reported in animals

(a)  The concentration of Aroclor 1242 is below the reportable limits for hazardous components (1 %) and/or carcinogens (0.1 %), 
as required by OSHA, 29 CFR 1910.1200 (g)(2)(i)(C)(1), for MSDS information.  NTP has listed Aroclor 1242 as reasonably 
anticipated  to  be  a  human  carcinogen  (as  PCBs,    CAS  number  1336-36-3);  IARC  has  listed  Aroclor 1242  in  Group 2A 
(probably carcinogenic to humans) related to PCBs.

EC Risk/Safety Phrases:  See Section 15, “Regulatory Information”. 

4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, qualified personnel should 
give artificial respiration.  Seek immediate medical attention. 
Skin Contact:  Wash skin with soap and water for at least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing and 
shoes.  Get medical attention, if needed.  Thoroughly clean and dry contaminated clothing and shoes before reuse.  
Eye Contact:  Flush eyes with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes.  Then get immediate medical attention. 

Ingestion:  If swallowed, get immediate medical attention. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Severe fire hazard.  The vapor is heavier than air.  Vapors or gases may ignite at 
distant ignition sources and flash back.  Vapor/air mixtures are explosive. 
Extinguishing Media:  Alcohol-resistant foam, carbon dioxide, regular dry chemical, fine water spray. 
Fire Fighting:  Move container from fire area if it can be done without risk.  Do not scatter spilled material with 
high-pressure water streams.  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion by-products.  Wear full protective clothing 
and NIOSH-approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 

Flash Point (C):  11 
Method:  Closed Cup.

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Occupational  Release:    Avoid  heat,  flames,  sparks  and  other  sources of  ignition.    Do not  touch  spilled  material. 
Stop  leak  if  possible  without  personal  risk.    Reduce  vapors  with  water  spray.    Small  spills:  Absorb  with  sand  or 
other non-combustible material.  Collect spilled material in appropriate container for disposal.  Remove sources of 
ignition.    Keep  unnecessary  people  away,  isolate  hazard  area  and  deny  entry.    Refer  to  Section 13,  “Disposal 
Considerations”.
