2. HAZARDS IDENTIFICATION

Radiological Hazard  

Warning:  THIS MATERIAL SHOULD ONLY BE USED BY PERSONS QUALIFIED TO HANDLE RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL!



This product contains licensed radioactive material and is therefore subject to the requirements of 10 CFR Part 20 (e.g., public and occupational exposure limits, waste disposal).  At a minimum, the basic radiation safety principles of time, distance, and shielding, and appropriate radiation contamination control should be practiced to avoid/minimize any external and/or internal exposure.  Consult with your Radiation Safety office for your facility’s radiation safety requirements/precautions specific to the radionuclide(s) (including its activity and chemical/physical form) in this Radioactive SRM.



SRM 4947c is a radioactive material, Hydrogen-3-toluene, with a massic activity of approximately
308 kBq•g-1.  Hydrogen3toluene decays by betaparticle emission.  During the decay process no photons are emitted.

4. FIRST AID MEASURES

Description of First Aid Measures: 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration or oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention.

Skin Contact:  Rinse affected area with copious amounts of water followed by washing with soap and water for at least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing.  Seek medical attention, if needed.

Eye Contact:  Immediately flush eyes, including under the eyelids with copious amounts of water for at least 30 minutes.  Seek immediate medical attention.
