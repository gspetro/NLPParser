4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Description of First Aid Measures  

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to well-ventilated (uncontaminated) area.  If breathing is difficult, 
qualified personnel may administer oxygen.  If not breathing, qualified personnel should give artificial respiration.  
Seek immediate medical attention.  
Skin Contact:  Rinse affected skin with water for at least 15 minutes, then wash thoroughly with soap or mild 
detergent and water.  If skin irritation persists, seek medical aid and bring the container or label. 
Eye Contact:  Flush eyes with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes. Then get immediate medical attention. 
Ingestion:  If a large amount is swallowed, get medical attention. 

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  Cyanosis of lips and nose, chest pain. 

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above 
symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Suitable:  Regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide, water, or regular foam. 
Unsuitable:  None listed. 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Slight fire hazard.  See Section 9, “Physical and Chemical Properties” for flammability 
properties. 
Extinguishing Media 
 
 
Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  When heated to decomposition, emits highly toxic fumes. 
Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Move container from fire area if it can be done 
without personal risk.  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion by-products.  Wear full protective clothing and 
NIOSH-approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe)

Health = 2 

Fire = 1 

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Use suitable protective equipment; 
see Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.  Keep out of waters supplies and sewers. 
Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Collect spilled material in an appropriate container for 
disposal.  Keep out of water supplies and sewers. 

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Safe Handling Precautions:  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”. 
Storage  and  Incompatible  Materials:    Store  in  accordance  with  all  current  regulations.    Keep  separated  from 
incompatible substances (see Section 10, “Stability and Reactivity”). 

8.  EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

Exposure Limits:  No established occupational exposure limits. 
Engineering Controls:   Provide  local  exhaust  or  process  enclosure  ventilation  system.  Ensure  compliance  with 
applicable exposure limits.

Personal Protection Measures:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal 
Protective Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material. 

Respiratory  Protection:    If workplace conditions warrant a  respirator, a  respiratory protection program that 
meets OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.   Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators. 
Eye Protection:  Splash resistant safety goggles and emergency eyewash are recommended. 
Skin and Body Protection:  Chemical resistant clothing and gloves are recommended.

Route of Exposure: 

Symptoms Related to the Physical, Chemical and Toxicological Characteristics:  Cyanosis. 

X 

Inhalation 

X 

Skin 

X 

Ingestion 

Potential Health Effects (Acute, Chronic, and Delayed) 

Ingestion:  Acute exposure to a large dose of acetanilide may cause methemoglobin resulting in cyanosis of the 
lips, nose, and earlobes.  Accompanying symptoms including weakness, dizziness, severe headache, ataxia rapid 
shallow  respiration,  drowsiness,  nausea,  vomiting,  confusion,  lethargy,  and  stupor.    Chronic  daily  doses 
exceeding 1 gram may result in methemoglobin and hemolytic anemia. 

Skin Contact:  Acute and chronic exposure to acetanilide may result in irritation and contact dermatitis. 

Eye Contact:  Acute and chronic exposure to acetanilide may cause irritation and conjunctivitis. 

Inhalation:  Acute exposure may cause the same effects as listed for ingestion.  Chronic exposure may result in 
chest pain, giddiness, epigastric pain, and highly-colored urine.  Symptoms may be delayed as a result of delayed 
absorption.
