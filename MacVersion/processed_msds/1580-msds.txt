4. FIRST AID MEASURES

Description of First Aid Measures: 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  Give artificial respiration if not breathing.  Seek immediate medical attention.

Skin Contact:  Wash skin with soap and water for at least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing and shoes.  Get immediate medical attention, if needed.  Thoroughly clean and dry contaminated clothing and shoes before reuse.

Eye Contact:  Flush eyes with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes.  Then get immediate medical attention.

Ingestion:  If a large amount is swallowed, get medical attention.

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  May cause irritation and skin cancer. 

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention.

5. FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Severe fire hazard.  Vapor/air mixtures are explosive.  The vapor is heavier than air.  Vapors or gases may ignite at distant ignition sources and flash back.  See Section 9, “Physical and Chemical Properties” for flammability properties.

Extinguishing Media:

		Suitable:  Regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide, water, and regular foam.

		Unsuitable:  None listed.

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  Miscellaneous decomposition products.

Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion byproducts.  Wear full protective clothing and NIOSH approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA).

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe)	

				Health = 2	Fire = 3	Reactivity = 0

6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Any accumulated material on surfaces should be removed and properly disposed of.  Use suitable protective equipment; see Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.

Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Avoid heat, flames, sparks and other sources of ignition.  Stop leak if possible without personal risk.  Reduce vapors with water spray.  Absorb with sand or other noncombustible material.  Collect spilled material in appropriate container for disposal.  Keep unnecessary people away, isolate hazard area and deny entry.  Subject to California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (Proposition 65).  Keep out of water supplies and sewers.

7. HANDLING AND STORAGE

Safe Handling Precautions:  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”. 

Storage:  Store and handle in accordance with all current regulations and standards.  Keep separated from incompatible substances (see Section 10, “Stability and Reactivity”).

8. EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION

Exposure Limits:  No occupation exposure limits established.

Engineering Controls:  Provide local exhaust or process enclosure ventilation system.  Ensure compliance with applicable exposure limits.

Personal Protection:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material.

Respiratory Protection:  If workplace conditions warrant a respirator, a respiratory protection program that meets OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.  Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators.

Eye/Face Protection:  Wear splash resistant safety goggles with a face shield.  An eyewash station should be readily available near areas of use.

Skin and Body Protection:  Wear appropriate chemical resistant clothing and gloves.
