Description: 

Standard Reference Material (SRM) 1587 consists of four vials, each containing 
1 mL of a methanol solution of seven nitrated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 
(N-PAHs)1.   

 

Substance: 

Methanol 

  Other Designations:

monohydroxymethane; wood spirit; wood naphtha; methylol) 

1 The total concentration of the PAHs in this material is less than 0.1 %, which is below the reportable limit (0.1 % for 
chemicals identified as carcinogens) required by OSHA according to 29 CFR 1910.1200 (g)(2)(i)(C)(1) for individual

  NFPA Ratings (Scale 0–4): 

Health = 2 

Fire = 3 

Reactivity = 0 

Major Health Hazards: 

Skin and eye irritation.  Central nervous system depression.  Nerve damage. 

Target Organs: 

Nervous system. 

Physical Hazards: 

Flammable liquid and vapor.  Vapor may cause a flash fire. 

  Potential Health Effects 
Inhalation: 
 

Inhalation  (acute  exposure)  of  methanol  may  cause  irritation  of  the  mucous 
membranes,  coughing,  oppression  in  the  chest,  and  bronchitis.    Metabolic 
acidosis  and  effects  on  the  eyes  and  central  nervous  system  may  also  occur.  
Repeated  or  prolonged  exposure  (chronic  exposure)  may  cause  effects  as  in 
acute  ingestion.    Repeated  exposure  to  200  ppm  to  375  ppm  caused  recurrent 
headaches in workers.

Skin Contact: 

Skin contact with methanol may cause irritation.  Skin absorption may occur and 
cause metabolic acidosis and effects on the eyes and the central nervous system. 
 Repeated  or  prolonged  contact  may  cause  defatting  of  the  skin  resulting  in 
erythema, scaling, and exzematoid dermatitis. 

Eye Contact: 

Eye contact with methanol vapors may cause irritation.  Repeated or prolonged 
contact may cause conjunctivitis. 

Ingestion: 

Ingestion of methanol may cause mild and transient subsequent drowsiness and 
inebriation.  A symptomatic period may follow lasting 4 to 48 hours.  Symptoms 
included  headache,  vertigo  or  dizziness,  nausea,  vomiting,  and  violent  pain  in 
the  back,  abdomen,  and  extremities.    Effects  on  the  eyes  may  included  optic 
neuritis,  blurred  vision,  dilated,  unresponsive  pupils,  eye  pain,  and  change  in 
color perception.  Partial or permanent blindness my occur.  As little as 15 mL 
has  caused  blindness.    Repeated  ingestion  may  cause  systematic  effects 
described in acute ingestion along with blindness or visual impairment.

In the National Toxicology Program (NTP) Report on Carcinogens. 
In the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Monographs. 
By the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). 

Inhalation: 

If inhaled, move the victim to fresh air.  If breathing is difficult, give oxygen; if 
the  victim  is  not  breathing,  give  artificial  respiration  by  qualified  personnel.  
Obtain medical assistance if necessary. 

Skin Contact: 

Remove  contaminated  shoes  and  clothing.    Rinse  affected  area  with  large 
amounts  of  water  followed  by  washing  the  area  with  soap  and  water.    Obtain 
medical assistance if necessary. 

 

Eye Contact: 

Immediately  flush  eyes,  including  under  the  eyelids,  with  copious  amounts  of 
water for at least 15 minutes.  Obtain medical assistance. 

Ingestion: 

If ingested, wash out mouth with water.  Obtain medical assistance immediately. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire and Explosion Hazards: 

Methanol is a severe fire and explosion hazard when exposed to heat or flame.  
Vapors are heavier than air and may travel a considerable distance to a source of 
ignition and flash back.  Vapor and air mixtures are explosive. 

  Extinguishing Media:  Use alcohol-resistant foam, dry chemical, carbon dioxide, or water spray. 

Fire Fighting: 

Move container from fire area if it can be done without risk.  DO NOT use high-
pressure water streams which could scatter spilled material.  Use water spray to 
cool containers until well after the fire is out and to discharge vapors.  Wear full 
protective  clothing  and  NIOSH-approved  self-contained  breathing  apparatus 
(SCBA).

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Occupational Release: 

Avoid  heat,  flames,  sparks,  and  other  sources  of ignition.  Reduce vapors with 
water  spray.    Collect  small  spilled  material  after  absorbing  with  sand  or  other 
non-combustible  material  in  an  appropriate  container  for  disposal.    For  large 
spills,  stop  leak  if possible without personal risk.  Remove sources of ignition.  
Notify  Local  Emergency  Planning  Committee  and  State  Emergency  Response 
Commission for release greater than or equal to the Release Quantity (RQ). 

Methanol is subject to reportable quantities (RQ) under Title III of SARA, which 
is  greater  than  the  unit  quantity  provided  for  SRM  1587.    See  Section  15, 
“Regulatory Information”. 

Disposal: 

Refer to Section 13, “Disposal Considerations”.
