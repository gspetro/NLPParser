4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Description of First Aid Measures  

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to well-ventilated (uncontaminated) area.  If breathing is difficult, 
qualified  personnel  may  administer  oxygen.    If  not  breathing,  qualified  personnel  should  give  artificial 
respiration.  Seek immediate medical attention.  
Skin Contact:  Rinse affected skin with water for at least 15 minutes, then wash thoroughly with soap or mild 
detergent and water.  If skin irritation persists, seek medical aid and bring the container or label. 
Eye Contact:  Immediately flush eyes, including under the eyelids, with copious amounts of water for at least 
15 minutes.  Seek immediate medical attention. 
Ingestion:  If a large amount is swallowed, seek medical attention. 

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  Irritation and cancer (suspect) through inhalation. 
Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above 
symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Suitable:  Regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide, water, or regular foam. 
Unsuitable:  Avoid using straight water streams in order to avoid frothing. 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Moderate fire hazard.  Vapor/air mixtures are explosive above the flash point.  See 
Section 9, “Physical and Chemical Properties” for flammability properties. 
Extinguishing Media 
 
 
Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  Not applicable. 
Special  Protective  Equipment  and  Precautions  for  Fire-Fighters:    Move  container  from  fire  area  if  it  can  be 
done without personal risk.  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion by-products.  Wear full protective clothing 
and NIOSH-approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe) 
 

Reactivity = 0 

Health = 1 

Fire = 2 

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Use suitable protective equipment; 
see Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.  Keep out of waters supplies and sewers. 
Methods  and  Materials  for  Containment  and  Clean  up:    Avoid  heat,  flames,  sparks  and  other  sources  of 
ignition.   Stop  leak  if  possible  without personal  risk, with water  spray to  reduce vapors.  Absorb  spilled  material 
with sand or non-combustible material and collect in appropriate container for disposal.  

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Safe Handling Precautions:  Avoid heat, flames, sparks and other sources of ignition.  See Section 8, “Exposure 
Controls and Personal Protection”. 
Storage  and  Incompatible  Materials:    Store  in  a  well-ventilated  area.    Keep  separated  from  incompatible 
substances (oxidizing materials).

8.  EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

Exposure Limits:  No occupational exposure limits established. 
Engineering Controls:   Provide  local  exhaust  or  process  enclosure  ventilation  system.  Ensure  compliance  with 
applicable exposure limits. 
Personal Protection Measures:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal 
Protective Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material. 

Respiratory  Protection:    If workplace conditions warrant a  respirator, a  respiratory protection program that 
meets  OSHA 29CFR 1910.134  must  be  followed.    Refer  to  NIOSH  42 CFR 84  for  applicable  certified 
respirators. 
Eye Protection:  Splash resistant safety goggles and emergency eyewash are recommended. 
Skin and Body Protection:  Chemical resistant clothing and gloves are recommended.

Symptoms  Related  to  the  Physical,  Chemical  and  Toxicological  Characteristics:    Eye  or  skin  irritation  and 
possible skin disorders. 

Potential Health Effects (Acute, Chronic, and Delayed) 

Inhalation:  Irritation hazard is low unless heated or misted.  High concentrations of vapor or mist may cause 
irritation and possibly systems of central nervous system depression.  Prolonged contact may cause irritation.
