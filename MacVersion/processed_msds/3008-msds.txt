Description:    This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  a  gravimetrically  prepared  single-compound  solution 
(methylene chloride) in methanol intended primarily for the calibration of instrumentation and validation of methods 
for volatile organic compound (VOC) determinations.  Because of its miscibility with water, this SRM can also be 
used to fortify aqueous samples with known amounts of the VOC.  A unit of SRM 3008 consists of two 5 mL sealed 
borosilicate  glass  ampoules  of  a  gravimetrically  prepared  solution  of  methylene  chloride  in  methanol.  
Approximately 2.5 mL of this SRM mixture is supplied in each 5 mL glass ampoule.

2.  HAZARDS IDENTIFICATION 

NFPA Ratings (Scale 0–4):  Health = 2 

Fire = 3 

Reactivity = 0 

NOTE:    This  methylene  chloride  in  methanol  solution  has  not  been  tested  as  a  whole.    The  health  and  physical 
hazard information are for the individual components, methylene chloride and methanol.  The actual effects of the 
solution may differ from the individual components. 

Major  Health  Hazards:    Skin,  eye,  and/or  respiratory  tract  irritation,  central  nervous  system  depression,  blood 
disorders,  liver  damage,  aspiration  hazard,  and  nerve  damage.    Methylene  chloride  is  a  known  cancer  hazard  (in 
humans). 

Physical  Hazards:    Flammable  liquid  and  vapor.    Vapor  may  cause  flash  fire.    Electrostatic  charges  may  be 
generated by flow or agitation. 

Potential Health Effects (Acute and Chronic) 

Inhalation:    Methanol  may  cause  irritation,  cough,  ringing  in  the  ears,  constipation,  headache,  drowsiness, 
dizziness,  tingling  sensation,  pain  in  extremities,  tremors,  loss  of  coordination,  blood  disorders,  and  nerve 
damage.  Methylene chloride can cause irritation, vomiting, chest pain, irregular heartbeat, headache, drowsiness, 
dizziness, disorientation, tingling, numbness of the extremities, a sensation of heat, drunkenness, stupor, dullness 
and mental confusion.  Long term exposure of methylene chloride may result in cancer. 

Skin  Contact:    Methanol  can  cause  irritation,  absorption  may  occur,  headache,  drowsiness,  dizziness,  loss  of 
coordination,  and  blood  disorders.    Methylene  chloride  can  cause  irritation  to  the  skin  (possibly  severe);  skin 
absorption may occur causing effects detailed in inhalation.  Prolonged or repeated contact may cause dermatitis. 

Eye  Contact:    Methanol  and  methylene  chloride  vapors  may  cause  irritation  and  eye  damage.    Repeated  or 
prolonged contact may cause conjunctivitis. 

Ingestion:  Ingestion of methanol may result in mild and transient inebriation and subsequent drowsiness.  Liver, 
kidney,  heart,  stomach,  intestine  and  pancreatic  damage  may  also  occur.    Death  may  occur  due  to  respiratory 
failure.  As little as 15 mL has caused blindness; the usual fatal dose is 60 mL to 240 mL.  Methylene chloride 
can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, convulsions, unconsciousness, irregular respiration, central 
nervous system depression, and convulsions.

4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration or 
oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek medical attention if needed. 

Eye Contact:  Immediately flush eyes with copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes. 

Skin Contact:  Wash exposed skin with copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes.  Remove contaminated 
clothing and shoes.  Thoroughly clean and dry contaminated clothing and shoes before reuse. 

Ingestion:    Ingestion  of  this  material  is  not  likely  under  normal  conditions  of  use.    Potential  aspiration  hazard  if 
ingested.  If swallowed, seek medical attention. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Severe fire hazard.  Vapor/air mixtures are explosive.  The vapor is heavier than air.  
Vapors or gases may ignite at distant ignition sources and flash back.  Electrostatic discharges may be generated by 
flow or agitation resulting in ignition or explosion. 

Extinguishing Media:  Alcohol-resistant foam, carbon dioxide, regular dry chemical, water. 

Fire  Fighting:    Avoid  inhalation  of  material  or  combustion  by-products.    Wear  full  protective  clothing  and 
NIOSH-approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 

Note:  The data listed below is for methanol.
