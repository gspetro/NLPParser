Coplanar Waveguide Calibration Set 

Under the U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.1200, 
this  Reference  Material  (RM)  is  NOT  classified  as  a  physical  hazard  or  a  health  hazard,  a  simple  asphyxiant, 
combustible  dust,  pyrophoric  gas,  or  hazard  not  otherwise  classified.    There  are  no  hazard  pictograms,  hazard 
statements or signal word associated with it.  Safety Data Sheet information is not required.  This document may be 
used in conjunction with your hazard communication program. 
 
Exemption:    1910.1200  (c).    This  RM  is  an  Article,  as  the  word  is  defined  by  OSHA,  where  Article  means  a 
manufactured item other than a fluid or particle: (i) which is formed to a specific shape or design during manufacture; 
(ii) which has end use function(s) dependent in whole or in part upon its shape or design during end use; and (iii) 
which under normal conditions of use does not release more than very small quantities, e.g., minute or trace amounts 
of a hazardous chemical (as determined under paragraph (d) of 1910.1200), and does not pose a physical hazard or 
health risk to employees.  
 
Description:  This RM is intended for use in by industrial laboratories that wish to implement the procedure described 
in Part 1 of the NIST/Industrial MMIC Consortium’s “Proposed Procedures for Verifying Probe Station Integrity and 
On-wafer Measurement Accuracy” for the measurement of microwave probe station stability and for verifying the 
ability to repeat on-wafer microwave measurements performed at NIST.  A unit of RM 8130 consists of a coplanar 
waveguide (CPW) calibration set fabricated on a gallium arsenide wafer. 
 
Disposal:  RM 8130 should be disposed of in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations. 
 
Transport  Information:    This  material  is  not  regulated  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  Transportation  (DOT)  and/or
