2.  HAZARDS IDENTIFICATION 

NFPA Ratings (Scale 0–4): 

Health = 2 

Fire = 3 

Reactivity = 0 

Major Health Hazards:  Respiratory tract irritation; skin and eye irritation; aspiration hazard; and central nervous 
system depression.   

Physical Hazards:  Extremely flammable liquid and vapor.  Vapor may cause flash fire.  Electrostatic charges may 
be generated by flow, agitation, etc. 

Potential Health Effects 

Inhalation:    Excessive  inhalation  of  vapors  may  cause  irritation  of  the  nasal  and  respiratory  tract.    High 
concentrations may cause asphyxiation and unconsciousness.  Myocardial sensitization may occur.  

Skin  Contact:    Direct  contact  with  the  liquid  may  cause  irritation  with  redness,  pain,  burning  and  itching.  
Skin absorption may occur.  Repeated or prolonged contact with the liquid mat cause defatting of the skin with 
dermatitis.  

Eye Contact:  Liquid may cause irritation with redness, tearing and blurred vision. 

Ingestion:    Ingestion  may  cause  irritation to  the  gastrointestinal  tract,  abdominal  pain  and  swelling,  nausea, 
vomiting  and diarrhea.   If  sufficient  amounts  are  absorbed, headache  and  central nervous  system  depression 
may occur.

4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration or 
oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Skin Contact:  Rinse affected area with copious amounts of water followed by washing with soap and water for at 
least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing.  Seek medical attention. 

Eye  Contact:    Immediately  flush  eyes,  including  under  the  eyelids  with  copious  amounts  of  water  for  at  least 
15 minutes.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Ingestion:  Contact a poison control center immediately for instructions.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Severe fire hazard.  The vapor is heavier than air.  Vapors or gases may ignite at 
distant ignition sources and flash back.  Vapor/air mixtures are explosive above flash point. 

Extinguishing Media:  Regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide, water, regular foam. 

Fire Fighting:  Move container from fire area if it can be done without risk.  Cool containers with water spray until 
well after the fire is out.  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion by-products.  Wear full protective clothing and 
NIOSH-approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 

Flash Point:  –4 C 
Method Used:  Closed Cup 

Autoignition Temp.:  204 C 

Flammability Limits in Air 

Upper (Volume %):  6.7 % 
Lower (Volume %):  1.05 % 

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Occupational  Release:    Avoid  heat,  flames,  sparks  and  other  sources  of  ignition.    Stop  leak  if  possible  without 
personal  risk.    Reduce  vapors  with  water  spray.    Absorb  with  sand  or  other  non-combustible  material.    Collect 
spilled material in suitable container for proper disposal. 

Disposal:  Refer to Section 13, “Disposal Considerations”. 

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Storage:  Store and handle in accordance with all current regulations and standards.  Subject to storage regulations: 
U.S.  OSHA  29 CFR 1910.106.    Grounding  and  bonding  required.    Keep  separated  from  incompatible  substances.  
Store in a tightly closed container.  Store in a cool, dry place.  Store in a well-ventilated area. 

Safe Handling Precautions:  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.

440 ppm Ceiling (15 min); 1800 mg/m3 Ceiling (15min) 
500 ppm; 2000 mg/m3 

Ventilation:  Use local exhaust ventilation system.  Ensure compliance with applicable exposure limits.  Refer to 
the ACGIH document, Industrial Ventilation, a Manual of Recommended Practices. 

Respirator:    If  workplace  conditions  warrant  a  respirator,  a  respiratory  protection  program  that  meets 
OSHA 29 CFR 1910.134 must be followed.  Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators. 

Eye Protection:  Wear chemical safety goggles.  An eyewash station should be readily available near areas of use. 

Personal  Protection:    Wear  appropriate  protective  clothing  and  chemically  resistant  gloves  to  prevent  skin 
exposure.
