3.  HAZARDS IDENTIFICATION 

NFPA Ratings (Scale 0–4): 

Health = 2 

Fire = 2 

Reactivity = 0 

Major Health Hazards:  Eye, skin and respiratory irritation. 

Physical Hazards:  Flammable liquid and vapor.  This material is listed as an OSHA Class II material. 

Potential Health Effects 

Inhalation:    Short  term  (acute)  exposure  to  concentrations  at  or  below  100  mg/m3  have  little  or  no  effect.  
Higher concentrations may result in irritation.  Repeated or prolonged (chronic) inhalation of fumes or mist my 
result in irritation, tracheitis, bronchitis or pneumonitis.  

Skin  Contact:    Short  term  (acute)  skin  contact  may  result  in  dry  skin,  irritation,  dermatitis,  and  edema.  
Repeated or prolonged (chronic) exposure may result in defatting of the skin and dermatitis.  

Eye Contact:  Mild to moderate irritation may occur. 

Ingestion:  Ingestion of this material is unlikely under normal conditions of use.  Ingestion of small amounts of 
may result in gastrointestinal irritation. 

Listed as a Carcinogen/Potential Carcinogen:  

 
In the National Toxicology Program (NTP) Report on Carcinogens 
In the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Monographs 
By the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)

4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  Seek medical attention if needed. 

Skin  Contact:    Wash  exposed  skin  with  copious  amounts  of  water  for  at  least  15  minutes.    Remove  any 
contaminated clothing.  Seek medical attention if needed. 

Eye  Contact:    Immediately  flush  eyes  with  copious  amounts  of  water  for  at  least  15  minutes.    Seek  immediate 
medical attention. 

Ingestion:  If swallowed do not induce vomiting. Seek immediate medical attention. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Moderate fire hazard.  Vapor/air mixtures are explosive above flash point.  Vapors 
are heavier than air and may ignite at a distant ignition source and flash back. 

Extinguishing Media:  Regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide, water, or regular foam. 

Fire Fighting:  Wear full protective clothing and NIOSH-approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 

Flash Point (C):  55 (131 °F). 
Method Used:  Closed Cup. 

Autoignition Temp. (C):  210 (410 °F) 

Flammability Limits in Air 
 
 

Upper Explosive Limit (UEL):  5 % 
Lower Explosive Limit (LEL):  0.7 %. 

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Occupational Release:  Avoid heat, flames, sparks or any other source of ignition.   Absorb with sand or other non-
combustible material.  Collect spilled material and place in an appropriate container for disposal 

Disposal:  Refer to Section 13, “Disposal Considerations”. 

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Storage:    Store  and  handle  in  accordance  with  all  current  regulations  and  standards.    The  tightly  capped  bottle 
should be stored under normal laboratory conditions away from direct sunlight. 

Safe Handling Precautions:  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”. 

8.  EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

Exposure Limits: 

ACGIH (TWA):  200 mg/m3 (application restricted to conditions in which there are negligible aerosol 
exposures as total hydrocarbon vapor) 

NIOSH (TWA):  100 mg/m3 

Ventilation:  Use a local exhaust ventilation system. 

Respirator:  Respiratory protection that meets OSHA 29 CFR 1910.134 is required if workplace conditions warrant 
respiratory protection.  Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators. 

Eye Protection:   Wear splash resistant safety goggles.  An eye wash station should be readily available near areas 
of use. 

Personal  Protection:    Wear  appropriate  protective  clothing  and  chemically  resistant  gloves  to  prevent  skin 
exposure.
