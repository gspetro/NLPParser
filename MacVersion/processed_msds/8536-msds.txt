GISP Greenland Ice Sheet Precipitation (Hydrogen and Oxygen Isotopes in Water) 

Under the U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.1200, 
this  Reference  Material  (RM)  is  NOT  classified  as  a  physical  hazard  or  a  health  hazard,  a  simple  asphyxiant,

used in conjunction with your hazard communication program. 
 
 
Description:    This  Reference  Material (RM)  is  a  secondary  reference  material  with  known  isotope-number  ratios 
for  hydrogen (H)  and  oxygen (O)  that  are  intermediate  to  VSMOW2 (RM 8535a)  and  SLAP (RM 8537).    It  is 
intended to be a control for working standards that have been calibrated to the VSMOW-SLAP (Vienna Standard 
Mean  Ocean  Water-Standard  Light  Antarctic  Precipitation)  δ-scales  for  isotope-number  ratios  of  hydrogen  and 
oxygen.  A unit of RM 8536 consists of one ampoule containing approximately 20 mL of water 
 
 
Disposal:    RM 8536  and  its  derived  solutions  should  be  disposed  of  in  accordance  with  local,  state,  and  federal
