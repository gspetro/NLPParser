SAFETY DATA SHEET



1. Substance and Source Identification 

	Product Identifier

		SRM Number:	3067

		SRM Name:	Toxaphene in Methanol

	Other Means of Identification:  Not applicable.

	Recommended Use of This Material and Restrictions of Use

This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended primarily for calibrating chromatographic instrumentation used for the determination of technical toxaphene.  Because of its miscibility with water, SRM 3067 can also be used to fortify aqueous samples with known amounts of toxaphene.  A unit of SRM 3067 consists of five 2mililiter ampoules, each containing approximately 1.2 mL of technical toxaphene in methanol.

3. COMPOSITION AND INFORMATION ON HAZARDOUS INGREDIENTS

Substance:  Methanol

Other Designations:  Methyl alcohol; wood alcohol; methyl hydroxide; wood spirit; wood naphtha.

The health and safety information included in this SDS is for methanol, the main component.  This material, a mixture of methanol containing trace amounts of toxaphene (Chemical Abstracts Registry Number 8001-35-2) has not been tested as a whole.  The concentration of toxaphene is below the reportable limits for hazardous components (1 %) and/or carcinogens (0.1 %), as required by OSHA, 29 CFR 1910.1200, for SDS information.  For the actual values, see the Certificate of Analysis.

4. FIRST AID MEASURES

Description of First Aid Measures 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area. Give artificial respiration if not breathing.  Get immediate medical attention. 

Skin Contact:  Rinse affected skin with water for at least 15 minutes, then wash thoroughly with soap or mild detergent and water.  If skin irritation persists, seek medical aid and bring the container or label.

Eye Contact:  Flush eyes with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes. Then get immediate medical attention.

Ingestion:  If a large amount is swallowed, get medical attention.

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  Skin irritation, eye irritation, central nervous system depression, and nerve damage.  May cause blindness.

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention.

5. FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Severe fire hazard.  Vapor/air mixtures are explosive above the flash point.  Vapors or gases may ignite at distant ignition sources and flash back.  See Section 9, “Physical and Chemical Properties” for flammability properties.

Extinguishing Media

		Suitable:  Regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide, water, or alcoholresistant foam.

		Unsuitable:  None listed.

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  Not applicable.

Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Move container from fire area if it can be done without personal risk.  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion byproducts.  Wear full protective clothing and NIOSHapproved selfcontained breathing apparatus (SCBA).

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe)

				Health = 2	Fire = 3	Reactivity = 0

6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Use suitable protective equipment; see Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.  Keep out of waters supplies and sewers.

Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Avoid heat, flames, sparks and other sources of ignition.  Stop leak if possible without personal risk, with water spray to reduce vapors.  Absorb spilled material with sand or noncombustible material and collect in appropriate container for disposal. 

7. HANDLING AND STORAGE

Safe Handling Precautions:  Handle glass ampoules with care.  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.

	Storage and Incompatible Materials:  Store in a wellventilated area.  Keep separated from incompatible substances (See Section 10, “Stability and Reactivity”).

8. EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION
