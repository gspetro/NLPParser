4. First Aid Measures

Description of First Aid Measures: 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration or oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention.

Skin Contact:  Wash exposed skin with soap and water for at least 15 minutes.  Seek medical attention if needed.

Eye Contact:  Immediately flush eyes, including under the eyelids with copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes.  Seek immediate medical attention.

Ingestion:  Aspiration hazard.  Do not induce vomiting.  If vomiting occurs, keep head lower than hips to prevent aspiration.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention.

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  Irritation, dizziness, nausea, coughing, and aspiration.

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  Not applicable.

5. FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Slight fire hazard.  See Section 9, “Physical and Chemical Properties” for flammability properties.

Extinguishing Media:

		Suitable:  Regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide, regular foam.

		Unsuitable:  Straight streams of water.

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  None listed.

6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Use suitable protective equipment; see Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.

Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Absorb spilled material with sand or noncombustible material and collect in appropriate container for disposal.  Keep out of water supplies and sewers.

7. HANDLING AND STORAGE

Safe Handling Precautions:  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.

Storage:  Store and handle in accordance with all current regulations and standards.  The storage floor must be impermeable and form a collecting basin so that, in the event of an accident spillage, the liquid cannot spread beyond the storage area.

8. EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION

Personal Protection Measures:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material.

Respiratory Protection:  If workplace conditions warrant a respirator, a respiratory protection program that meets OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.  Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators.

Eye/Face Protection:  Wear splash resistant safety goggles with a face shield. An eye wash station should be readily available near areas of use.

Skin and Body Protection:  Personal protective equipment for the body should be selected based on the task being performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a specialist before handling this product. Chemical-resistant gloves should be worn at all times when handling chemicals.
