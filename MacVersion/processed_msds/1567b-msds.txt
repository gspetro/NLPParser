1.  SUBSTANCE AND SOURCE IDENTIFICATION  

Product Identifier 
1567b 
SRM Number: 
SRM Name: 
Wheat Flour 
Other Means of Identification:  Not applicable. 

Recommended Use of This Material and Restrictions of Use 

This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  validation  of  methods  for  determining 
elements in wheat flour and similar materials.  This SRM can also be used for quality assurance when assigning 
values  to  in-house  reference  materials.    A  unit  of  SRM 1567b  consists  of  a  single  bottle  containing 
approximately 50 g of material sealed inside an aluminized pouch.

2.  HAZARDS IDENTIFICATION 

Note:    This  processed  material  is  intended  for  laboratory  use  only;  not  for  human  consumption.    SRM 1567b  is 
supplied in a small quantity and under normal laboratory conditions it does not constitute a combustible dust hazard.  
The  physical  properties  of  this  material  indicate  that  accumulated  dust  on  surfaces  generated  where  operations 
produce fine particulates, may lead to combustible dust concentrations in air.

4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Description of First Aid Measures:  

Inhalation:    If  adverse  effects  occur,  remove  to  uncontaminated  area.    If  not  breathing,  give  artificial 
respiration or oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Skin Contact:  Wash skin with soap and water for at least 15 minutes.  Thoroughly clean and dry contaminated 
clothing before reuse. 

Eye Contact:  Flush eyes with water for at least 15 minutes.  If necessary, seek medical attention. 

Ingestion:  If adverse effects occur after ingestion, seek medical treatment. 

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  Skin or eye mechanical irritation.  

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above 
symptoms are present, seek medical attention if needed. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Avoid generating dust; sufficient concentrations of fine dust dispersed in air, and in 
the  presence  of  an  ignition  source  is  a  potential  hazard.    See  Section 9,  “Physical  and  Chemical  Properties”  for 
flammability properties. 

Extinguishing Media: 
 
 

Suitable:  Regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide, water, and regular foam. 
Unsuitable:  None listed. 

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  None listed. 

Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for  Fire-Fighters:  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion 
byproducts.  Wear full protective clothing and NIOSH approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe) 

 

Health = 0 

Fire = 0 

Reactivity = 0 

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Personal  Precautions,  Protective  Equipment  and  Emergency  Procedures:    Any  accumulated  material  on 
surfaces should be removed and properly disposed of.  Use suitable protective equipment; see Section 8, “Exposure 
Controls and Personal Protection”. 

Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Do not touch spilled material.  Notify safety personnel 
of spills.  Collect spilled material in appropriate container for disposal.  Isolate hazard area and deny entry. 

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Safe  Handling  Precautions:    Minimize  dust  generation  and  accumulation  on  surfaces.    See  Section 8,  “Exposure 
Controls and Personal Protection”. 

Storage:    Store  and  handling  in  accordance  with  all  current  regulations  and  standards.    Keep  separated  from 
incompatible substances; see Section 10, “Stability and Reactivity”. 

8.  EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

Exposure  Limits:    This  material  is  a  particulate  matter  and  adequate  inhalation/respiratory  protection  should  be 
used to minimize exposure.  No occupational exposure limits have been established for wheat flour.  The exposure 
limits for Particulates Not Otherwise Regulated are applicable. 
OSHA (PEL):  15 mg/m3 (TWA, total particulates) 
 

5 mg/m3 (TWA, respirable particulates) 

Engineering Controls:   Provide  local  exhaust  or  process  enclosure  ventilation  system.  Ensure  compliance  with 
applicable exposure limits. 

Personal Protection:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal Protective 
Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material.

Respiratory Protection:    If workplace conditions warrant a respirator, a respiratory protection program that meets 
OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.   Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators. 

Eye/Face  Protection:    Wear  splash  resistant  safety  goggles  with  a  face  shield.    An  eye  wash  station  should  be 
readily available near areas of use. 

Skin  and  Body  Protection:    Personal  protective  equipment  for  the  body  should  be  selected  based  on  the  task 
being  performed  and  the  risks  involved  and  should  be  approved  by  a  specialist  before  handling  this  product.  
Chemical-resistant gloves should be worn at all times when handling chemicals.
