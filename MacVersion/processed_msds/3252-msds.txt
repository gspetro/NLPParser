SRM Number:  3252 
SRM Name: 
Other Means of Identification:  Not applicable. 

Protein Drink Mix 

Recommended Use of This Material and Restrictions of Use 

This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  validation  of  methods  for  determining 
proximates,  fatty  acids,  cholesterol,  vitamins,  elements,  and  amino  acids  in  protein  drink  mixes  and  similar 
materials.  This SRM can also be used for quality assurance when assigning values to in-house reference materials.  
The  SRM  is  a  blend  of  commercial  protein  drink  mixes.    A  unit  of  SRM 3252  consists  of  five  heat-sealed 
aluminized pouches, each containing approximately 10 g of material.

4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Description of First Aid Measures:  

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration 
or oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Skin Contact:  Wash skin with soap and water for at least 15 minutes.  Thoroughly clean and dry contaminated 
clothing before reuse. 

Eye Contact:  Flush eyes with water for at least 15 minutes.  If necessary, seek medical attention. 

Ingestion:  If adverse effects occur after ingestion, seek medical treatment. 

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  Skin or eye mechanical irritation.  

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above 
symptoms are present, seek medical attention if needed. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire  and  Explosion  Hazards:    Avoid  generating  dust.    See  Section 9,  “Physical  and  Chemical  Properties”  for 
flammability properties. 

Extinguishing Media: 
 
 

Suitable:  Regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide, water, and regular foam. 
Unsuitable:  None listed. 

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  None listed. 

Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion 
byproducts.  Wear full protective clothing and NIOSH approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe)  

 

Health = 0 

Fire = 0 

Reactivity = 0 

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Personal  Precautions,  Protective  Equipment  and  Emergency  Procedures:    Any  accumulated  material  on 
surfaces should be removed and properly disposed of.  Use suitable protective equipment; see Section 8, “Exposure 
Controls and Personal Protection”. 

Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Do not touch spilled material.  Notify safety personnel 
of spills.  Collect spilled material in appropriate container for disposal.  Isolate hazard area and deny entry. 

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Safe Handling Precautions:  Minimize dust generation and accumulation on surfaces.  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls 
and Personal Protection”. 

Storage:  Store and handle in accordance with all current regulations and standards. 

8.  EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

Exposure Limits:  This material is a particulate matter and adequate inhalation/respiratory protection should be used 
to minimize exposure.  No occupational exposure limits have been established for Protein drink mix.  The exposure 
limits for Particulates Not Otherwise Regulated are applicable. 

OSHA (PEL):  15 mg/m3 (TWA, total particulates) 
 

5 mg/m3 (TWA, respirable particulates) 

Engineering Controls:   Provide  local  exhaust  or  process  enclosure  ventilation  system.  Ensure  compliance  with 
applicable exposure limits.

Personal Protection:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal Protective 
Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material. 

Respiratory  Protection:    If workplace conditions warrant a  respirator, a  respiratory protection program that 
meets OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.   Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators. 

Eye/Face Protection:  Wear splash resistant safety goggles with a face shield.  An eye wash station should be 
readily available near areas of use. 

Skin and Body Protection:  Personal protective equipment for the body should be selected based on the task 
being performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a specialist before handling this product.  
Chemical-resistant gloves should be worn at all times when handling chemicals.
