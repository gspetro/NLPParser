4.  First Aid Measures

Description of First Aid Measures 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to wellventilated (uncontaminated) area.  If breathing is difficult, qualified personnel may administer oxygen.  If not breathing, qualified personnel should give artificial respiration.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Skin Contact:  Rinse affected skin with water for at least 15 minutes, then wash thoroughly with soap or mild detergent and water.  If skin irritation persists, seek medical aid and bring the container or label.

Eye Contact:  Immediately flush eyes, including under the eyelids, with copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes.  Seek immediate medical attention.

Ingestion:  Aspiration hazard.  Do not induce vomiting.  Contact local poison control immediately; if vomiting occurs, keep head lower than hips to prevent aspiration.  If unconscious, turn head to side; get medical attention immediately.

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  Aspiration hazard, blood damage, liver damage, central nervous system depression, cancer hazard (in humans).

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention.

5.  Fire Fighting Measures

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Severe fire hazard.  Vapor/air mixtures are explosive above the flash point.  Vapors or gases may ignite at distant ignition sources and flash back.  See Section 9, “Physical and Chemical Properties” for flammability properties.

Extinguishing Media

	Suitable:  Regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide, water, or alcoholresistant foam.

	Unsuitable:  None listed.

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  Not applicable.

Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for FireFighters:  Move container from fire area if it can be done without personal risk.  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion byproducts.  Wear full protective clothing and NIOSHapproved selfcontained breathing apparatus (SCBA).

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe)

				Health = 3	Fire = 3	Reactivity = 0

6.  Accidental Release Measures

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Use suitable protective equipment; see Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.  Keep out of waters supplies and sewers.

Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Avoid heat, flames, sparks and other sources of ignition.  Stop leak if possible without personal risk, with water spray to reduce vapors.  Absorb spilled material with sand or noncombustible material and collect in appropriate container for disposal. 

7.  Handling and Storage

Safe Handling Precautions:  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.

Storage and Incompatible Materials:  Store in a wellventilated area.  Keep separated from incompatible substances (see Section 10, “Stability and Reactivity”).
