4.  First Aid Measures

Description of First Aid Measures 

Inhalation:  Remove victim to fresh air.  If not breathing, qualified personnel should give artificial respiration.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Skin Contact:  Rinse affected skin with water for at least 15 minutes, then wash thoroughly with soap or mild detergent and water.  If skin irritation or rash persists, seek medical aid and bring the container or label.

Eye Contact:  Immediately flush eyes, including under the eyelids, with copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes.  

Ingestion:  If swallowed, get medical attention if you feel unwell.

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  Kidney damage and cancer hazard (in humans).

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention.

5.  Fire Fighting Measures

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Slight fire hazard.  Dust/air mixtures may ignite or explode.  See Section 9, “Physical and Chemical Properties” for flammability properties.

	Unsuitable:  None listed.

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  Not applicable.

Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for FireFighters:  Move container from fire area if it can be done without personal risk.  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion byproducts.  Wear full protective clothing and NIOSHapproved selfcontained breathing apparatus (SCBA).

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe)

				Health = 2	Fire = 1	Reactivity = 0

6.  Accidental Release Measures

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Use suitable protective equipment; see Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.  Keep out of waters supplies and sewers.

Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Collect in appropriate container for disposal. 

7.  Handling and Storage

Safe Handling Precautions:  Avoid dust formation.  Avoid breathing vapors, mist or gas.  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.

Storage and Incompatible Materials:  Store in a wellventilated area.  Keep separated from incompatible substances (see Section 10, “Stability and Reactivity”).

8. Exposure Controls and Personal Protection

Exposure Limits

	OSHA (PEL):	No occupation exposure limits established.

			NIOSH (REL):	0.015 mg/m3 TWA – (Except nickel carbonyl) as Ni, related to nickel compounds

				10 mg/m3 IDLH – (Except nickel carbonyl) as Ni, related to nickel compounds

			ACGIH (TLV):	No occupation exposure limits established.

Engineering Controls:  Provide local exhaust or process enclosure ventilation system.  Ensure compliance with applicable exposure limits.

Personal Protection Measures:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material.

Respiratory Protection:  If workplace conditions warrant a respirator, a respiratory protection program that meets OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.  Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators.
