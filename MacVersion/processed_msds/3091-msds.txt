Description:  This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is a set of six different solutions of individual Aroclors in 
methanol.    These  solutions  are  99.9 %  Methanol.    A  unit  of  SRM 3091  consist  of  six  2-mL  ampoules,  each 
containing approximately 1.2 mL of each of the following SRM solutions:  SRM 3081 Aroclor 1016 in Methanol; 
SRM 3082 Aroclor 1232 in Methanol; SRM 3083 Aroclor 1242 in Methanol; SRM 3084 Aroclor 1248 in Methanol; 
SRM 3085 Aroclor 1254 in Methanol; and SRM 3086 Aroclor 1260 in Methanol.  This SRM is intended primarily 
for calibrating chromatographic instrumentation and methods of analysis used for the determination of Aroclors and 
polychlorinated byphenyls (PCBs) in water. 

Other Designations:  Wood alcohol; wood spirit; methyl hydroxide; methyl alcohol. 

Substance:  Methanol. 

2.  HAZARDS IDENTIFICATION  

NFPA Ratings (Scale 0-4):  Health = 2 

Fire = 3 

Reactivity = 0 

NOTE:    The  health  and  safety  information  included  in  this  MSDS  is  for  methanol,  the  main  component  of  this 
SRM.  The concentration of Aroclors in this NIST SRM is below the reportable limits for hazardous components 
(1 %) and/or carcinogens (0.1 %), as required by OSHA, 29 CFR 1910.1200 (g)(2)(i)(C)(1), for MSDS information. 

Major Health Hazards:  Skin and eye irritation, central nervous system depression, and nerve damage. 

Physical Hazards:  Flammable liquid and vapor.  Vapor may cause flash fire. 

Potential Health Effects 

Inhalation:    Exposure  may  cause  irritation  of  the  mucous  membranes,  coughing,  tracheitis,  bronchitis, 
tinnitus, unsteady gait, twitching, constipation, nystagmus, and blepharospams.  Repeated exposure may result 
in recurrent headaches, diminution of vision, enlargement of the liver, and allergic reactions. 

Skin Contact:  Exposure may cause irritation.  Skin absorption may occur and cause metabolic acidosis and 
effect on the eyes and central nervous system.  Repeated or long-term exposure may lead to defatting of the 
skin resulting in erythema, scaling, and eczematoid dermatitis. 

Eye  Contact:    Vapors  may  cause  irritation.    High  concentrations  have  been  reported  to  cause  violent 
inflammation  of  the  conjunctiva  and  epithelial  defects  on  the  cornea.    Repeated  or  prolonged  contact  may 
cause conjunctivitis. 

Ingestion:  Ingestion may result in mild and transient inebriation and subsequent drowsiness followed by an 
asymptomatic  period  lasting  8-48  hours.    Following  the  delay,  coughing,  dyspnea,  headache,  dullness, 
weakness, nausea, vomiting, violent pain in the back, abdomen, and extremities, apathy or delirium may occur.  
Rapid  shallow  respiration due  to  metabolic  acidosis, hypotension,  cyanosis,  convulsions,  cardiac depression, 
cerebral  and  pulmonary  edema,  unconsciousness,  and  coma  may  occur.    Liver,  kidney,  heart,  stomach, 
intestine  and  pancreatic  damage  may  also  occur.    Death  may  occur  due  to  respiratory  failure.    As  little  as 
15 mL has caused blindness; the usual fatal dose is 60–240 mL.

3.  COMPOSITION AND INFORMATION ON HAZARDOUS INGREDIENTS  
 
Component(a) 
Methanol 
(a) This  material  is  a  complex  mixture  that  has  not  been  tested  as  a  whole.    The  material  contains  organic  compounds  (see 
Certificate  of  Analysis),  which  have  been  reported  to  have  toxic,  mutagenic,  and/or  carcinogenic  properties,  and  should  be 
handled  with  care.    Components  are  listed  in  accordance  with  OSHA,  29 CFR 1910.1200 (g)(2)(i)(C)(1)  which  requires 
identification  of  hazardous  components  at  concentrations  greater  than  1 %  and  carcinogens  at  concentrations  greater  than 
0.1 %.

4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

EC Risk/Safety Phrases:  Refer to Section 15, “Regulatory Information”. 

Note:    EC  information  is  based on  the  concentration of methanol  in  solution.    The  listed  EC  information  is  for a 
methanol solution of 10 % or greater. 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration or 
oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Eye  Contact:    Immediately  flush  eyes,  including  under  the  eyelids  with  copious  amounts  of  water  for  at  least 
15 minutes.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Skin Contact:  Rinse affected area with copious amounts of water followed by washing with soap and water for at 
least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing.  Seek medical attention, if needed. 

Ingestion:  Contact a poison control center immediately for instructions.  Give water to rinse out mouth.  Never give 
liquids to a person with reduced awareness or becoming unconscious.  If vomiting occurs, keep head lower than hips 
to prevent aspiration.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical 
attention. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Severe fire hazard.  Vapor/air mixtures are explosive.  The vapor is heavier than air.  
Vapors or gases may ignite at distant ignition sources and flash back.  OSHA Class IB flammable liquid. 

Extinguishing Media:  Alcohol-resistant foam, carbon dioxide, regular dry chemical, water. 

Fire  Fighting:    Avoid  inhalation  of  material  or  combustion  byproducts.    Wear  full  protective  clothing  and 
NIOSH-approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA).

Occupational  Release:    Avoid  heat,  flames,  sparks  and  other  sources of  ignition.    Do not  touch  spilled  material. 
Stop leak if possible without personal risk.  Reduce vapors with water spray.  Absorb small spills with sand or other 
non-combustible  material.    Collect  spilled  material  in  appropriate  container  for  disposal.    Remove  sources  of 
ignition.  Keep unnecessary people away, isolate hazard area and deny entry. 

Disposal:  Refer to Section 13, “Disposal Considerations”.
