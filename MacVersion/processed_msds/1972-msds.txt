4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Description of First Aid Measures:  

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  Give artificial respiration if not breathing.  
Seek immediate medical attention. 

Skin Contact:  Wash skin with soap and water for at least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing and 
shoes.    Get  immediate  medical  attention,  if  needed.    Thoroughly  clean  and  dry  contaminated  clothing  before 
reuse. 

Eye Contact:  Flush eyes with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes.  Then get immediate medical attention. 

Ingestion:  Contact local poison control center or physician immediately.  Never make an unconscious person 
vomit or drink fluids. When vomiting occurs, keep head lower than hips to help prevent aspiration. If person is 
unconscious, turn head to side. Get medical attention immediately. 

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  Eye, skin, and respiratory tract irritation.  

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above 
symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Slight fire hazard.  See Section 9, “Physical and Chemical Properties” for flammability 
properties. 

Extinguishing Media: 
 
 

Suitable:  Alcohol-resistant foam, carbon dioxide, regular dry chemical, and water. 
Unsuitable:  None listed. 

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  Thermal decomposition will form oxides of carbon. 

Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion 
byproducts.  Wear full protective clothing and NIOSH approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe) 

 

Health = 2 

Fire = 1 

Reactivity = 0 

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Personal  Precautions,  Protective  Equipment  and  Emergency  Procedures:    Immediately  contact  emergency 
personnel.  Keep unnecessary personnel away.  Use suitable protective equipment; see Section 8, “Exposure Controls 
and Personal Protection”.  

Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Avoid heat, flames, sparks and other sources of ignition.  
Remove sources of ignition.  Reduce vapors with water spray.  Absorb with sand or other noncombustible material.  
Collect spilled material in appropriate container for disposal.  Keep unnecessary people away, isolate hazard area and 
deny entry.  Stay upwind and keep out of low areas. 

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Safe Handling Precautions:  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”. 

Storage:    Store  and  handle  in  accordance  with  all  current  regulations  and  standards.    Keep  separated  from 
incompatible substances (see Section 10, “Stability and Reactivity”).

8.  EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

Exposure Limits:  No occupational exposure limits available. 

Engineering Controls:   Provide  local  exhaust  or  process  enclosure  ventilation  system.  Ensure  compliance  with 
applicable exposure limits. 

Personal Protection:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal Protective 
Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material. 

Respiratory  Protection:    If workplace conditions warrant a  respirator, a  respiratory protection program that 
meets OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.   Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators. 

Eye/Face Protection:  Wear splash resistant safety goggles with a face shield.  An eyewash station should be 
readily available near areas of use. 

Skin and Body Protection:  Personal protective equipment for the body should be selected based on the task 
being performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a specialist before handling this product.  
Chemical-resistant gloves should be worn at all times when handling chemicals.
