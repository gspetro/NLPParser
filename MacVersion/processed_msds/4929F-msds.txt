Warning:    THIS  MATERIAL  SHOULD  ONLY  BE  USED  BY  PERSONS  QUALIFIED  TO  HANDLE 
RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL!   

This product contains licensed radioactive material and is therefore subject to the requirements of 10 CFR Part 20 
(e.g., public and occupational exposure limits, waste disposal).  At a minimum, the basic radiation safety principles 
of  time,  distance,  and  shielding,  and  appropriate  radiation  contamination  control  should  be  practiced  to 
avoid/minimize any external and/or internal exposure.  Consult with your Radiation Safety office for your facility’s 
radiation safety requirements/precautions specific to the radionuclide(s) (including its activity and chemical/physical 
form) in this Radioactive SRM. 

SRM  4929F  is  a  radioactive  material,  Iron-55,  with  a  massic  activity  of  approximately  58  kBq•g-1  in 
hydrochloric acid.  Iron-55 decays by electron capture.  During the decay process X-rays and gamma rays with 
energies from approximately 0.5 keV to 125 keV are emitted. 

Physical Hazard: There are no known physical hazards associated with this material.

Symptoms  Related  to  the  Physical,  Chemical  and  Toxicological  Characteristics:    Burning  pain  and  severe 
corrosive skin damage.  Permanent eye damage including blindness could result. 

Potential Health Effects (Acute, Chronic and Delayed): 

Inhalation:  Hydrochloric acid, if inhaled, can damage the mucous membranes and respiratory tract.  Short term 
exposure  may  cause  irritation  and  inflammation  of  the  upper  respiratory  tract,  coughing,  choking,  sore  throat, 
shortness of breath, headache, dizziness, and nausea.  Long term exposure to acid fumes may cause damage to 
teeth, bronchial irritation, chronic cough, bronchial pneumonia, and gastrointestinal disturbances.   

Skin  Contact:    Hydrochloric  acid  can  cause  severe  skin  burns.    Severity  of  the  damage  depends  on  the 
concentration and duration of exposure.  Effects of acid burns may be delayed. 

Eye  Contact:    Hydrochloric  acid  can  cause  severe  eye  irritation,  corneal  burns,  permanent  eye  damage,  or 
blindness.  Severity of the damage depends on the concentration and duration of exposure.
