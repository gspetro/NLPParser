4. FIRST AID MEASURES 

Description of First Aid Measures:  

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration 
or oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Skin Contact:  Wash exposed skin with soap and water for at least 15 minutes.  Seek medical attention if needed. 

Eye Contact:  Immediately flush eyes, including under the eyelids with copious amounts of water for at least 15 
minutes.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Ingestion:  Aspiration hazard.  Do not induce vomiting.  If vomiting occurs, keep head lower than hips to prevent 
aspiration.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  Irritation, dizziness, nausea, coughing, and aspiration. 

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  Not applicable. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Slight fire hazard.  See Section 9, “Physical and Chemical Properties” for flammability 
properties. 

Extinguishing Media: 
 
 

Suitable:  Regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide, regular foam. 
Unsuitable:  None listed. 

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  None listed. 

Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion 
byproducts.  Wear full protective clothing and NIOSH approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe) 

 

Health = 0 

Fire = 1 

Reactivity = 0 

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Use suitable protective equipment; 
see Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”. 

Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Absorb spilled material with sand or non-combustible 
material and collect in appropriate container for disposal. 

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Safe Handling Precautions:  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”. 

Storage:  Store and handling in accordance with all current regulations and standards.  The storage floor must be 
impermeable and form a collecting basin so that, in the event of an accident spillage, the liquid cannot spread beyond 
the storage area.

No exposure limits established. 

Engineering Controls:   Provide  local  exhaust  or  process  enclosure  ventilation  system.  Ensure  compliance  with 
applicable exposure limits. 

Personal Protection Measures:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal 
Protective Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material. 

Respiratory Protection:    If workplace conditions warrant a respirator, a respiratory protection program that meets 
OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.   Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators. 

Eye/Face Protection:  Wear splash resistant safety goggles with a face shield. An eye wash station should be readily 
available near areas of use. 

Skin and Body Protection:  Personal protective equipment for the body should be selected based on the task being 
performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a specialist before handling this product. Chemical-
resistant gloves should be worn at all times when handling chemicals.

Inhalation 

X 

Skin 

X 

Ingestion 

Symptoms Related to the Physical, Chemical and Toxicological Characteristics: Dizziness, nausea, coughing. 

Potential Health Effects (Acute, Chronic and Delayed): 

Inhalation:  Acute exposure to high levels of vapor may cause central nervous system depression, headache, 
dizziness, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, incoordination and unconsciousness.  Prolonged or repeated exposure may 
cause irritation. 

Skin Contact:  Acute exposure may cause redness.  Chronic skin exposure may cause defatting and drying of the 
skin resulting in irritation and dermatitis.
