4. FIRST AID MEASURES

Description of First Aid Measures: 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  Give artificial respiration if not breathing.  Seek immediate medical attention.

Skin Contact:  Wash skin with soap and water for at least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing and shoes.  Get immediate medical attention, if needed.  Thoroughly clean and dry contaminated clothing before reuse.

Eye Contact:  Flush eyes with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes.  Then get immediate medical attention.

Ingestion:  Contact local poison control center or physician immediately.  Never make an unconscious person vomit or drink fluids. When vomiting occurs, keep head lower than hips to help prevent aspiration.  If person is unconscious, turn head to side. Get medical attention immediately.

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  Respiratory tract irritation, eye irritation, and central nervous system depression. 

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention.

5. FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Severe fire hazard.  The vapor is heavier than air.  Vapors or gases may ignite at distant ignition sources and flash back.  Vapor/air mixtures are explosive above flash point.  See Section 9, “Physical and Chemical Properties” for flammability properties.

Extinguishing Media:

		Suitable:  Alcoholresistant foam, carbon dioxide, regular dry chemical, and water.

		Unsuitable:  None listed.

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  Thermal decomposition will form oxides of oxides of carbon.

Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion byproducts.  Wear full protective clothing and NIOSH approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA).

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe)	

				Health = 2	Fire = 3	Reactivity = 0

6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Immediately contact emergency personnel.  Keep unnecessary personnel away.  Use suitable protective equipment; see Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”. 

Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Avoid heat, flames, sparks and other sources of ignition.  Remove sources of ignition.  Reduce vapors with water spray.  Absorb with sand or other noncombustible material.  Collect spilled material in appropriate container for disposal.  Keep unnecessary people away, isolate hazard area and deny entry.  Stay upwind and keep out of low areas.

7. HANDLING AND STORAGE

Safe Handling Precautions:  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.  Handle glass ampoules with care.

Storage:  Store and handle in accordance with all current regulations and standards.  Keep separated from incompatible substances (see Section 10, “Stability and Reactivity”).

8. EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION

Exposure Limits:

		NIOSH (REL):  	400 ppm (1400 mg/m3) (TWA)

			2000 ppm (IDLH, 10 % LEL)

		ACGIH (TLV):	400 ppm (TWA)

		

		OSHA (PEL):  	400 ppm (1400 mg/m3) (TWA)

Engineering Controls:  Provide local exhaust or process enclosure ventilation system.  Ensure compliance with applicable exposure limits.

Personal Protection:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material.

Respiratory Protection:  If workplace conditions warrant a respirator, a respiratory protection program that meets OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.  Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators.

Eye/Face Protection:  Wear splash resistant safety goggles with a face shield.  An eyewash station should be readily available near areas of use.

Skin and Body Protection:  Personal protective equipment for the body should be selected based on the task being performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a specialist before handling this product.  Chemical-resistant gloves should be worn at all times when handling chemicals.
