1.  SUBSTANCE AND SOURCE IDENTIFICATION  

Product Identifier 

SRM Number:    4927g 
SRM Name:  Hydrogen-3 Radioactivity Standard 
Other Means of Identification: Not applicable.   

Recommended Use of This Material and Restrictions of Use 

This Standard Reference Material (SRM) consists of a solution of tritiated water (3H labeled oxidane) having a 
standardized and certified quantity of radioactive hydrogen-3 in a suitably stable and homogeneous matrix.  It is 
intended primarily for the calibration of instruments that are used to measure radioactivity and for the monitoring 
of  radiochemical  procedures.    A  unit  of  SRM  4927g  consists  of  approximately  5  mL  of  tritiated  water  in  a 
flame-sealed borosilicate-glass ampoule.

4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Description of First Aid Measures:  

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration 
or oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Skin Contact:  Rinse affected area with copious amounts of water followed by washing with soap and water for 
at least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing.  Seek medical attention, if needed. 

Eye Contact:  Immediately flush eyes, including under the eyelids with copious amounts of water for at least 
30 minutes.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Ingestion:  Contact a poison control center immediately for instructions.  Wash out mouth with water, but do not 
induce vomiting.  Seek medical aid at once, and bring the container or label. 

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  Not applicable. 

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above 
symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention.   

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

This material is radioactive.  DO NOT touch spilled material.  Immediately notify safety personnel of a spill. 

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment, Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up: 

Radiological Emergency Procedures: 
The following is a guide for first responders.  The following actions, including remediation, should be carried out by 
qualified individuals.  In cases where a life-threatening injury occurs concurrent with personal contamination, treat 
the injury first.   
Do not touch damaged packages or spilled material.  Handle as a radioactive material spill.  In addition to those actions 
described below, the guidelines in the Emergency Response Guidebook (ERG) provide more specific measures that 
should be followed. 

Spill and Leak Control: 

Alert and clear everyone from the area affected by the spill. 
Take actions to limit the spread of contamination.  
Summon aid. 

Damage to the Radioactive Source: 

Evacuate the immediate vicinity around the source. 
Place a barrier at a safe distance from the source. 
Identify area as a radiation hazard.
