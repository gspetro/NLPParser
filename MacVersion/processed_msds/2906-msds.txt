	Recommended Use of This Material and Restrictions of Use

This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended for use in calibrating and evaluating analytical equipment used for the detection of trace explosives, which may include those based on ion mobility spectrometry.  SRM 2906 consists of three dilute solutions of RDX, TNT, and PETN.  A unit of SRM 2906 consists of four glass ampoules of each of the three explosives containing approximately 1 mL of the solution and four vials of the 2propanol solvent used to prepare the solutions.  In addition, there are four labeled dropper bottles for temporary storage of the solutions once opened.

4. FIRST AID MEASURES

Description of First Aid Measures:

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration or oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention.

Skin Contact:  Rinse affected area with soap and water for at least 15 minutes.  Seek medical assistance if necessary.

Eye Contact:  Flush eyes with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes.  Then get immediate medical attention.

Ingestion:  If a large amount is swallowed, get medical attention.

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  Respiratory tract irritation, eye irritation, and central nervous system depression.

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention.  

5. FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Severe fire hazard.  Vapor is heavier than air.  Vapors or gases may ignite at distant ignition sources and flash back.  Vapor/air mixtures are explosive above flash point.  See Section 9, “Physical and Chemical Properties” for flammability properties.

Extinguishing Media:

		Suitable:  Regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide, water, and alcohol resistant foam.

		Unsuitable:  None listed.

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  Thermal decomposition will form oxides of carbon.

Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion byproducts.  Wear full protective clothing and NIOSH approved selfcontained breathing apparatus (SCBA).

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe)

				Health = 2	Fire = 3	Reactivity = 0

6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Immediately contact emergency personnel.  Keep unnecessary personnel away.  Avoid heat, flames, sparks and other sources of ignition.  Remove sources of ignition.  Stop leak if possible without personal risk.  Reduce vapors with water spray.  Use suitable protective equipment; see Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.

Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Absorb with sand or other noncombustible material.  Collect spilled material in appropriate container for disposal.  Keep unnecessary people away, isolate hazard area and deny entry.  Stay upwind and keep out of low areas.

7. HANDLING AND STORAGE

Safe Handling Precautions:  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.  Keep separated from incompatible substances.

Storage:  Store and handle in accordance with all current regulations and standards.  Keep separated from incompatible substances (see Section 10, “Stability and Reactivity”).

Respiratory Protection:  If workplace conditions warrant a respirator, a respiratory protection program that meets OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.  Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators.

Eye/Face Protection:  Wear splash resistant safety goggles with a face shield. An eye wash station should be readily available near areas of use.

Skin and Body Protection:  Personal protective equipment for the body should be selected based on the task being performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a specialist before handling this product.  Chemical-resistant gloves should be worn at all times when handling chemicals.
