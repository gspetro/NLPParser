Description:    This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  a  gravimetrically  prepared  single-compound  solution 
(m-xylene)  in  methanol  intended  primarily  for  the  calibration  of  instrumentation  and  validation  of  methods  for 
volatile  organic  compound (VOC)  determinations.    A  unit  of  SRM 3004  consists  of  two  5 mL  sealed  borosilicate 
glass  ampoules  of  a  gravimetrically  prepared  solution  of  m-xylene  in  methanol.    Approximately  2.5 mL  of  this 
mixture is supplied in each 5 mL glass ampoule. 

Substance:  m-Xylene in Methanol. 

Other Designations: 

2.  HAZARDS IDENTIFICATION 

Methanol (methyl alcohol; methyl hydroxide; wood alcohol; wood spirit). 
m-Xylene (1,3-Dimethylbenzene; m-dimethylbenzene; m-methyltoluene; 1,3-xylene). 

NFPA Ratings (Scale 0–4):  Health = 2 

Fire = 3 

Reactivity = 0 

NOTE:    This  m-xylene  in  methanol  solution  has  not  been  tested  as  a  whole.    The  health  and  physical  hazard 
information  are  for  m-xylene  and  methanol.    The  actual  effects  of  the  solution  may  differ  from  the  individual 
components. 

Major  Health  Hazards:    Skin,  eye,  and  respiratory  tract  irritation,  central  nervous  system  depression,  nerve 
damage, aspiration hazard. 

Physical  Hazards:    Flammable  liquid  and  vapor.    Vapor  may  cause  flash  fire.    Electrostatic  charges  may  be 
generated by flow or agitation. 

Potential Health Effects (Acute and Chronic): 

Inhalation:    Methanol  may  cause  irritation,  cough,  ringing  in  the  ears,  constipation,  headache,  drowsiness, 
dizziness,  tingling  sensation,  pain  in  extremities,  tremors,  loss  of  coordination,  blood  disorders,  and  nerve 
damage.  m-Xylene may cause respiratory tract irritation with difficulty breathing.  Other symptoms of exposure 
may include transient euphoria, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dizziness, ataxia, and staggering. 

Skin  Contact:    Methanol  can  cause  irritation,  absorption  may  occur,  headache,  drowsiness,  dizziness,  loss  of 
coordination, and blood disorders.  m-Xylene may cause irritation and defatting of the skin. 

Eye  Contact:    Vapors  may  cause  irritation  and  eye  damage.    Repeated  or  prolonged  contact  may  cause 
conjunctivitis.  m-Xylene may cause irritation, possibly severe. 

Ingestion:    Ingestion  of  methanol  may  result  in  mild  and  transient  inebriation,  and  subsequent  drowsiness.  
Liver,  kidney,  heart,  stomach,  intestine  and  pancreatic  damage  may  also  occur.    Death  may  occur  due  to 
respiratory  failure.    As  little  as  15 mL  has  caused  blindness;  the  usual  fatal  dose  is  60–240 mL.    Ingestion  of 
m-xylene may cause a burning sensation in the mouth and stomach, severe gastrointestinal distress, and central 
nervous system depression.  m-Xylene poses an aspiration hazard.

4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration or 
oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek medical attention if needed. 

Eye Contact:  Immediately flush eyes with copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes. 

Skin Contact:  Wash exposed skin with copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes.  Remove contaminated 
clothing and shoes.  Thoroughly clean and dry contaminated clothing and shoes before reuse. 

Ingestion:    Ingestion  of  this  material  is  not  likely  under  normal  conditions  of  use.    Potential  aspiration  hazard  if 
ingested.  If swallowed, seek medical attention. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Severe fire hazard.  Vapor/air mixtures are explosive.  The vapor is heavier than air.  
Vapors or gases may ignite at distant ignition sources and flash back.  Electrostatic discharges may be generated by 
flow or agitation resulting in ignition or explosion. 

Extinguishing Media:  Alcohol-resistant foam, carbon dioxide, regular dry chemical, water. 

Fire  Fighting:    Avoid  inhalation  of  material  or  combustion  by-products.    Wear  full  protective  clothing  and 
NIOSH-approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 

Note:  The data listed below is for methanol.
