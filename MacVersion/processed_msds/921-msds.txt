Description of First Aid Measures  

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area. Give artificial respiration if not breathing. 
Get immediate medical attention. 

Skin Contact:  Wash skin with soap and water for at least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing and 
shoes.  Get medical attention, if needed. Thoroughly clean and dry contaminated clothing and shoes before reuse. 

Eye Contact:  Flush eyes with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes. Then get immediate medical attention. 

Ingestion:  If a large amount is swallowed, get medical attention. 

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  Systemic poisoning and irritation. 

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above 
symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Slight fire hazard.  Dust/air mixtures may ignite or explode.  See Section 9, “Physical 
and Chemical Properties” for flammability properties. 

Extinguishing Media 
 
 

Suitable:  Regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide, water, or regular foam. 
Unsuitable:  None listed. 

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  Not applicable. 

Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Move container from fire area if it can be done 
without personal risk.  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion by-products.  Wear full protective clothing and 
NIOSH-approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA).

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Safe  Handling  Precautions:    Use  methods  to  minimize  dust.    See  Section 8,  “Exposure  Controls  and  Personal 
Protection”. 

Storage and Incompatible Materials:  Keep this SRM refrigerated (4 ºC) in a well-closed container away from direct 
sunlight.  Keep separated from incompatible substances (See Section 10, “Stability and Reactivity”). 

8.  EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

Exposure Limits:  This material is a particulate matter and adequate inhalation/respiratory protection should be used 
to minimize exposure.  No occupational exposure limits have been established for this material.  The exposure limits 
for Particulates Not Otherwise Regulated are applicable.  

OSHA (PEL): 
 

15 mg/m3 (TWA, total particulates) 
5 mg/m3 (TWA, respirable particulates) 

Engineering Controls:   Provide  local  exhaust  or  process  enclosure  ventilation  system.  Ensure  compliance  with 
applicable exposure limits. 

Personal Protection Measures:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal 
Protective Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material. 

Respiratory  Protection:    If workplace conditions warrant a  respirator, a  respiratory protection program that 
meets OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.   Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators. 

Eye Protection:  Splash resistant safety goggles and emergency eyewash are recommended. 

Skin and Body Protection:  Chemical resistant clothing and gloves are recommended.

Ingestion 

Symptoms  Related  to  the  Physical,  Chemical  and  Toxicological  Characteristics:  Systemic  poisoning  and 
irritation. 

Potential Health Effects (Acute, Chronic, and Delayed) 

Inhalation:  Prolonged exposure may cause irritation, hoarseness and increase susceptibility to fungal infections 
of the mouth and throat.  Systemic poisoning is possible at high dosage. 

Skin  Contact:    Prolonged  topical  application  may  cause  itching,  erythema,  dryness,  epidermal  and  dermal 
atrophy manifested by thinning of the skin, possible pustulation, perioral dermatitis, impede healing of ulcers, 
and local hypertrichosis.   

Eye  Contact:   Topical  application  may  cause reversible mydriasis.    Prolonged  topical application may  cause 
ptosis.    Systemic  poisoning  is  possible  resulting  in  ocular  effects  such  as  increased  susceptibility  to  fungal 
infections, corneal thinning, cataract formation, optic nerve damage, and blindness.  Other systemic effects may 
occur as described in chronic ingestion. 

Ingestion:  A large single dose of corticosteroids is reported to be virtually without harmful effects.  Systemic 
corticosteroid poisoning from chronic exposure may cause fluid retention, hypotension or shock-like reactions, 
muscle  weakness  and  fatigue,  osteoporosis,  cardiovascular  effects,  pituitary  and  adrenal  suppression, 
hyperglycemia, mental symptoms, acne, peptic ulcers, and increased susceptibility to infection.
