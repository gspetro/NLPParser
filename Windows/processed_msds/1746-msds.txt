SAFETY DATA SHEET 

1.  SUBSTANCE AND SOURCE IDENTIFICATION  

Product Identifier 

SRM Number:  1746 
SRM Name:  Silver Freezing-Point Standard 
Other Means of Identification:  Not applicable. 

Recommended Use of This Material and Restrictions of Use 

This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended for use as one of the defining fixed points of temperature.  
The temperature value of 961.780 C is assigned to the freezing point of pure silver.  The fixed point is realized 
as the plateau temperature (or liquidus point) of the freezing curve of slowly frozen high-purity silver.  The metal 
is in the form of millimeter-size "shot" and is provided in 300 g units in Mylar envelopes in an atmosphere of 
argon.

4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Description of First Aid Measures  

Inhalation:    If  adverse  effects  occur,  remove  to  well-ventilated  (uncontaminated)  area.    If  not  breathing, 
qualified personnel should give artificial respiration.  Seek immediate medical attention.  

Skin Contact:  Rinse affected skin with water for at least 15 minutes, then wash thoroughly with soap or mild 
detergent and water.  If skin irritation persists, seek medical aid and bring the container or label. 

Eye Contact:  Immediately flush eyes, including under the eyelids, with copious amounts of water for at least 
15 minutes.   

Ingestion:  If a large amount is swallowed, get medical attention. 

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  May cause mild or mechanical eye, skin, or respiratory 
tract irritation. 

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above 
symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire  and  Explosion  Hazards:    Neglible  fire  hazard  in  millimeter  shot  form.    Dust/air  mixtures  may  ignite  or 
explode.  See Section 9, “Physical and Chemical Properties” for flammability properties. 

Extinguishing Media 
 
 

Suitable:  Regular dry chemical, dolomite, carbon dioxide, or alcohol-resistant foam. 
Unsuitable:  Water. 

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  Not applicable. 

Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for  Fire-Fighters:  Move container from fire area if it can be 
done without personal risk.  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion by-products.  Wear full protective clothing 
and NIOSH-approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe) 
 

Reactivity = 0 

Health = 2 

Fire = 3 

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Use suitable protective equipment; 
see Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.  Keep out of waters supplies and sewers. 

Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Collect in appropriate container for disposal.  

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Safe Handling Precautions:  Avoid dust formation.  Avoid breathing vapors, mist or gas.  See Section 8, “Exposure 
Controls and Personal Protection”. 

Storage  and  Incompatible  Materials:    Store  in  a  well-ventilated  area.    Keep  separated  from  incompatible 
substances (see Section 10, “Stability and Reactivity”). 

8. EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

Exposure Limits 

 
 
 
 

0.01 mg/m3 TWA – dust 
OSHA (PEL): 
NIOSH (REL):  0.01 mg/m3 TWA – dust 
 
ACGIH (TLV):  0.1 mg/m3 TWA – dust and fume 

10 mg/m3 IDLH – dust 

Engineering Controls:  Provide local exhaust or process enclosure ventilation system.  Ensure compliance with 
applicable exposure limits. 

Personal Protection Measures:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal 
Protective Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material.

Respiratory Protection:  If workplace conditions warrant a respirator, a respiratory protection program that 
meets  OSHA  29CFR  1910.134  must  be  followed.    Refer  to  NIOSH  42  CFR  84  for  applicable  certified 
respirators. 

Eye Protection:  Splash resistant safety goggles and emergency eyewash are recommended. 

Skin and Body Protection:  Chemical resistant clothing and gloves are recommended.
