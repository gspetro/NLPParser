Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above 
symptoms are present, seek medical attention if needed. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Negligible fire hazard.  Avoid generating dust.  See Section 9, “Physical and Chemical

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Any accumulated material on surfaces 
should be removed and properly disposed of.  Use suitable protective equipment; see Section 8, “Exposure Controls 
and Personal Protection”. 
Methods  and  Materials  for  Containment  and  Clean  up:    Collect  spilled  material  in  appropriate  container  for 
disposal.  Avoid generating dust.  Clean up residue with a high-efficiency particulate filter vacuum. 

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Safe Handling Precautions:  Use suitable personal protection equipment (PPE).  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls 
and Personal Protection”. 
Storage and Incompatible Materials:  Store and handle in accordance with all current regulations and standards.  
Keep separated from incompatible substances (see Section 10, “Stability and Reactivity”).

8.  EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

 
Exposure Limits: This material is a particulate matter and adequate inhalation/respiratory protection should be used 
to minimize exposure.  No occupational exposure limits have been established for this material.  The exposure limits 
for Particulates Not Otherwise Regulated are applicable.  

OSHA (PEL): 

15 mg/m3 (TWA, total particulates)  
5 mg/m3 (TWA, respirable particulates) 

Engineering Controls:   Provide  local  exhaust  or  process  enclosure  ventilation  system.  Ensure  compliance 
with  applicable exposure limits. 

Personal Protection Measures:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate PPE 
to minimize exposure to this material. 

Respiratory  Protection:    If workplace conditions warrant a  respirator, a  respiratory protection program that 
meets OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.   Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators. 

Eye/Face Protection:  Eye and face protection is required when dust is generated.  Wear splash resistant safety 
goggles.  Provide an emergency eye wash fountain and quick drench shower in the immediate work area. 

Skin and Body Protection:  Standard PPE is recommended to avoid irritation.

Symptoms  Related  to  the  Physical,  Chemical  and  Toxicological  Characteristics:    Generated  dust  may  cause 
respiratory irritation. 

Potential Health Effects (Acute, Chronic, and Delayed) 

Inhalation:  Acute exposure to vanadium, or vanadium compounds has been shown to cause respiratory tract 
irritation.  Workers exposed to various concentrations of vanadium dust developed a persistent cough, wheezing, 
chest pain, and sore throat.  No alterations in lung function were observed, and all symptoms were reversible 
within days or weeks of exposure.  Chronic exposure to vanadium dust has resulted in pathological changes to 
the lungs including emphysema and pneumosclerosis.  Symptoms of chronic exposure may include coughing, 
conjunctivitis, nose and throat irritation, breathing difficulties, chronic bronchitis, headache, and rhinitis. 
Skin Contact:  Skin exposure may result in mechanical irritation. 
Eye Contact:  Direct contact may cause mechanical irritation. 
Ingestion: 
ingestion  of  bis(1-phenyl-1,3-
butanediono)oxovanadium(IV).  Ingestion of some vanadium compounds has resulted in gastrointestinal effects 
in some patients at therapeutic doses.
