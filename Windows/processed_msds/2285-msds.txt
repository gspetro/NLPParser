4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Description of First Aid Measures  

Inhalation:    If  adverse  effects  occur,  remove  to  well-ventilated  (uncontaminated)  area.    Give  artificial 
respiration if not breathing.  Get immediate medical attention. 

Skin Contact:  Wash skin with soap and water for at least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing 
and shoes.  Thoroughly clean and dry before reuse. Get medical attention, if needed. 

Eye Contact:  Flush eyes with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes.  Then get immediate medical attention. 

Ingestion:   If a large amount is swallowed, seek medical attention. 

Most  Important  Symptoms/Effects,  Acute  and  Delayed:  May  cause  eye  and  skin  irritation,  central  nervous 
system depression, cancer; releases CO during detoxification. 

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above 
symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire  and  Explosion  Hazards:    Slight  fire  hazard.    See  Section  9,  “Physical  and  Chemical  Properties”  for 
flammability properties.
