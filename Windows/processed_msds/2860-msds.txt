2860 
Phthalates in Polyvinyl Chloride 

 

This  Standard  Reference  Material  (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  use  in  validating  methods  for 
determining  six  phthalate  esters  in  polyvinyl  chloride  (PVC).    The  phthalates  esters  are  di-n-butyl 
phthalate, benzyl butyl phthalate, bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, di-n-octyl phthalate, diisononyl phthalate, 
and  diisodecyl  phthalate.    A  unit  of  SRM 2860  consists  of  shredded  material  as  follows,  of  one  jar 
containing approximately 2 g of BLANK (PVC) with no phthalates added; and two jars each containing 
approximately 2 g of Level I (Nominal Concentration 0.1 % Phthalates in PVC) and Level II (Nominal 
Concentration 2 % Phthalates in PVC) respectively, for a total of three jars.

4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Description of First Aid Measures:  

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration 
or oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Skin Contact:  Wash skin with soap and water for at least 15 minutes.  Thoroughly clean and dry contaminated 
clothing before reuse.

Respiratory Protection:    If workplace conditions warrant a respirator, a respiratory protection program that meets 
OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.   Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators. 

Eye/Face Protection:  Wear safety goggles.  An eye wash station should be readily available near areas of use. 

Skin and Body Protection:  Personal protective equipment for the body should be selected based on the task being 
performed  and  the  risks  involved  and  should  be  approved  by  a  specialist  before  handling  this  product.  
Chemical-resistant gloves should be worn at all times when handling chemicals (i.e. nitrile).

Recommended Use of This Material and Restrictions of Use 

This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended primarily for use in validating methods for determining six 
phthalate  esters  in  polyvinyl  chloride  (PVC).    The  phthalates  esters  are  di-n-butyl  phthalate,  benzyl  butyl 
phthalate, bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, di-n-octyl phthalate, diisononyl phthalate, and diisodecyl phthalate.   A 
unit of SRM 2860 consists of shredded material as follows, one jar containing approximately 2 g of BLANK 
(PVC)  with  no  phthalates  added;  and  two  jars  each  containing  approximately  2 g  of  Level I (Nominal 
Concentration  0.1 %  Phthalates  in  PVC)  and  Level II  (Nominal  Concentration  2 %  Phthalates  in  PVC) 
respectively, for a total of three jars.

4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Description of First Aid Measures:  

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration 
or oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Skin Contact:  Wash skin with soap and water for at least 15 minutes.  Thoroughly clean and dry contaminated 
clothing before reuse. 

Eye Contact:  Flush eyes with water for at least 15 minutes.  If necessary, seek medical attention. 

Ingestion:  If a large amount is swallowed, get medical attention. 

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  None reported.  

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above 
symptoms are present, seek medical attention if needed. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire  and  Explosion  Hazards:    Negligible  fire  hazard.    See  Section 9,  “Physical  and  Chemical  Properties”  for 
flammability properties. 

Extinguishing Media: 
 
 

Suitable:  Regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide, water, regular foam. 
Unsuitable:  None listed. 

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  None listed. 

Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion 
byproducts.  Wear full protective clothing and NIOSH approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA).
