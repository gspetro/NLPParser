6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Any accumulated material on surfaces 
should be removed and properly disposed of.  Keep unnecessary personnel away.  Use suitable protective equipment; 
see Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”. 

Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Notify safety personnel of spills.  Dry sweeping or air 
hoses should not be used to clean work areas.  Use of HEPA-filtered vacuum cleaners is recommended.  Collect 
spilled  material  in  appropriate  container  for  disposal.    Isolate  hazard  area  and  deny  entry.    Prevent  discharge  to 
natural waters, sewers and biological waste water treatment plants. 

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Safe Handling Precautions:  Minimize dust generation and accumulation on surfaces.  Routine housekeeping should 
be instituted to ensure that dusts do not accumulate on surfaces.  Avoid generating dust.  See Section 8, “Exposure 
Controls and Personal Protection”. 

Storage:  Store and handling in accordance with all current regulations and standards. 

8.  EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

Exposure Limits: 

NIOSH (TWA):  1 µg/m3 (respirable nanotubes-elemental carbon) 
OSHA (PEL):  No occupational limits established for carbon nanotubes. 

Engineering Controls:   Provide  local  exhaust  or  process  enclosure  ventilation  system.  Ensure  compliance  with 
applicable exposure limits. 

Personal Protection:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal Protective 
Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material. 

Respiratory Protection:    At a minimum wear a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health NIOSH 
certified air-purifying tight-fitting full-face respirator with N-100, P-100 or R-100 cartridge or equivalent in 
accordance with respiratory protection requirements specified in OSHA 29 CFR 1910.134 and NIOSH 42 CFR 
84 whenever exposure to the product by inhalation is possible. 

Eye/Face Protection:  Wear chemical goggles or safety glasses at all times unless the NIOSH fullface respirator 
discussed  immediately  above  is  being  worn.    The  respirator’s  mask  provides  appropriate  eye.    An  eyewash 
station should be readily available near areas of use. 

Skin and Body Protection:  Personal protective equipment for the body should be selected based on the task 
being performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a specialist before handling this product.   

Protecting gloves:  

Suitable materials for safety gloves/ EN 374-3: Nitrile rubber (NBR; > 0.35 mm).   

Unsuitable material: Do not wear neoprene gloves, as neoprene absorbs nanoparticles.  Each such 
item of personal protective equipment must be selected and used in accordance with OSHA dermal 
protection requirements at 29 CFR 1910.132, 1910.133 and 1910.138.

Symptoms Related to the Physical, Chemical and Toxicological Characteristics:  Coughing, respiratory effects 
(pulmonary inflammation). 

Potential Health Effects (Acute, Chronic and Delayed): 

Inhalation:    The  National  Institute  for  Occupational  Safety  and  Health (NIOSH)  systematically  reviewed  54 
laboratory animal studies, many of which indicated that carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and carbon nanofibers could 
cause adverse pulmonary effects including inflammation, granulomas, and pulmonary fibrosis.  There are well 
established correlations between results of animal studies and adverse effects in workers exposed to particulates 
and other air contaminants.  In addition, NIOSH considers these animal study findings to be relevant to human 
health risks because similar lung effects have been observed in workers exposed to respirable particulates of other 
materials in dusty jobs.  Moreover, in animal studies where CNTs were compared with other known fibrogenic 
materials  (e.g.,  silica,  asbestos,  ultrafine  carbon  black),  the  CNTs  were  of  similar  or  greater  potency,  and  the 
effects, including fibrosis, developed soon after exposure and persisted.  This SRM contains >0.1 % of a substance 
classified as Category 1 for respiratory sensitization. 

Skin Contact:  This SRM contains >0.1 % of a substance classified as Category 1 for skin sensitization.
