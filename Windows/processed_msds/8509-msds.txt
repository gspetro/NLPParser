4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Description of First Aid Measures  

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to well-ventilated (uncontaminated) area.  If breathing is difficult, 
qualified personnel may administer oxygen.  If not breathing, qualified personnel should give artificial respiration.  
Seek immediate medical attention.  

Skin Contact:  Rinse affected skin with water for at least 15 minutes, then wash thoroughly with soap or mild 
detergent and water.  If skin irritation persists, seek medical aid and bring the container or label. 

Eye Contact:  Immediately flush eyes, including under the eyelids, with copious amounts of water for at least 
15 minutes.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Ingestion:  If ingested, seek medical attention. 

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  Skin irritation, eye irritation, central nervous system 
depression, and nerve damage.  May cause blindness. 

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above 
symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Severe fire hazard.  Vapor/air mixtures are explosive above the flash point.  Vapors or 
gases may ignite at distant ignition sources and flash back.  See Section 9, “Physical and Chemical Properties” for 
flammability properties. 

Extinguishing Media 
 
 

Suitable:  Regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide, water, or alcohol-resistant foam. 
Unsuitable:  None listed. 

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  Not applicable. 

Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Move container from fire area if it can be done 
without personal risk.  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion by-products.  Wear full protective clothing and 
NIOSH-approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA).

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Use suitable protective equipment; 
see Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.  Keep out of waters supplies and sewers. 

Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Avoid heat, flames, sparks and other sources of ignition.  
Stop leak if possible without personal risk, with water spray to reduce vapors.  Absorb spilled material with sand or 
non-combustible material and collect in appropriate container for disposal.  

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Safe Handling Precautions:  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”. 

Storage and Incompatible Materials:  Store in a well-ventilated area.  Keep separated from incompatible substances 
(see Section 10, “Stability and Reactivity”).

applicable exposure limits. 

Personal Protection Measures:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal 
Protective Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material. 

Respiratory  Protection:    If workplace conditions warrant a  respirator, a  respiratory protection program that 
meets OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.   Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators.
