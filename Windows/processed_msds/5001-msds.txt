Exemption:    1910.1200  (c).    This  SRM  is  an  Article,  as  the  word  is  defined  by  OSHA,  where  Article  means  a 
manufactured item other than a fluid or particle: (i) which is formed to a specific shape or design during manufacture;

risk to employees.  
 
Description: 
  This  SRM  is  intended  primarily  for  calibrating  high  accuracy  two  dimensional  (X-Y) 
Photomask/Reticle registration metrology tools such as the IPRO, the IPRO II and the Leica 2020 as well as older 
tools such as the Nikon XY_5i.  A unit of SRM 5001 consists of a grid of 27 × 27 unit cells with a nominal 5 mm 
pitch between cells.  Each cell consists of a frame, a solid box, and a micro-array.  This grid pattern is printed on 
fused-quartz substrate with nominal dimensions of 15.2 cm × 15.2 cm × 0.64 cm or 6.0 in × 6.0 in × 0.25 in using 
Photomask production techniques as described in the certificate. 
 
Disposal:  SRM 5001 should be disposed of in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations. 
 
Transport  Information:    This  material  is  not  regulated  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  Transportation  (DOT)  and/or
