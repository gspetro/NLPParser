4. FIRST AID MEASURES

Description of First Aid Measures: 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  Give artificial respiration if not breathing, or oxygen by qualified personnel.  Get immediate medical attention.

Skin Contact:  Wash skin with soap and water for at least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing and shoes.  Get medical attention, if needed.  Thoroughly clean and dry contaminated clothing before reuse.

Eye Contact:  Flush eyes with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes. Then get immediate medical attention.

Ingestion:  If a large amount is swallowed, get medical attention.

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  Eye irritation and skin sensitization.

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention.

5. FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Severe fire and explosion hazard.  This material is considered a Class B explosive under OSHA 1910.109(a)(3)(ii) and 1.3C under US DOT 49 CFR 173.51.  Avoid sparks, flame, heat, friction or impact.  Dust/air mixtures may ignite or explode.  May explode if exposed to shock, friction or heating.  See Section 9, “Physical and Chemical Properties” for flammability properties.

Extinguishing Media:

		Suitable:  Flood with a large volume of water.

		Unsuitable:  Do not use water jet as an extinguisher, as this may spread fire.

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  Toxic vapors/gases may be formed during a fire and miscellaneous decomposition products.

Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion byproducts.  Wear full protective clothing and NIOSH approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA).

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe)	

				Health = 2	Fire = 4	Reactivity = 4


6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Immediately contact emergency personnel.  Keep unnecessary personnel away.  Eliminate all ignition sources.  Wear appropriate protective equipment and non-flammable or flame retardant clothing during clean-up.  Use suitable protective equipment; see Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”. 

Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Avoid generating dust.  Do not touch spilled material.  Notify safety personnel of spills.  Collect spilled material in appropriate container for disposal.  Isolate hazard area and deny entry.

7. HANDLING AND STORAGE

Safe Handling Precautions:  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”. 

Storage:  Store and handle in accordance with all current regulations and standards.  Keep separated from incompatible substances (see Section 10, “Stability and Reactivity”).
