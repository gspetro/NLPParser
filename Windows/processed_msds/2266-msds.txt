Note:  This material contains trace amounts of hopanes and steranes in 2,2,4-Trimethylpentane.  The concentrations 
are  below  the  reportable  limit  for  hazardous  components  (1  %  or  greater)  and  carcinogens  (0.1  %  or  greater), 
required by OSHA, 29 CFR 1910.1200 (g)(2)(i)(C)(1), for SDS information.  For actual concentrations, see the 
NIST Certificate of Analysis.

4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Description of First Aid Measures  

Inhalation:    If  adverse  effects  occur,  remove  to  well-ventilated  (uncontaminated)  area.    Give  artificial 
respiration if not breathing.  Get immediate medical attention. 

Skin Contact:  Wash skin with soap and water for at least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing 
and shoes.  Thoroughly clean and dry before reuse. Get medical attention, if needed. 

Eye Contact:  Flush eyes with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes.  Then get immediate medical attention. 

Ingestion:  Aspiration hazard.  Do not induce vomiting.  If vomiting occurs, keep head lower than hips to help 
prevent aspiration.  Get immediate medical attention.  Give artificial respiration if not breathing. 

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  Respiratory tract irritation, aspiration hazard, central 
nervous system depression. 

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above 
symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention. 

5.  Fire Fighting Measures 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Severe fire hazard.  The vapor is heavier than air.  Vapor/air mixtures are explosive 
above the flash point.  Vapors or gases may ignite at distant ignition sources and flash back.  See Section 9, “Physical 
and Chemical Properties” for flammability properties.

Suitable:  Regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide, water, or alcohol-resistant foam. 
Unsuitable:  None listed. 

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  Not applicable. 

Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Move container from fire area if it can be 
done without personal risk.  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion by-products.  Wear full protective clothing 
and NIOSH-approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe) 
 

Reactivity = 0 

Health = 2

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Use suitable protective equipment; 
see Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.  Keep out of waters supplies and sewers. 

Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Avoid heat, flames, sparks and other sources of ignition.  
Stop leak if possible without personal risk, with water spray to reduce vapors.  Absorb spilled material with sand or 
non-combustible material and collect in appropriate container for disposal.  

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Safe Handling Precautions:  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”. 

Storage  and  Incompatible  Materials:    Store  in  a  well-ventilated  area.    Keep  separated  from  incompatible 
substances (see Section 10, “Stability and Reactivity”). 

8. EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

Exposure Limits:  No occupational limits established. 

Engineering Controls:  Provide local exhaust or process enclosure ventilation system.  Ensure compliance with 
applicable exposure limits. 

Personal Protection Measures:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal 
Protective Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material. 

Respiratory Protection:  If workplace conditions warrant a respirator, a respiratory protection program 
that meets OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.  Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified 
respirators. 

Eye Protection:  Splash resistant safety goggles and emergency eyewash are recommended. 

Skin and Body Protection:  Chemical resistant clothing and gloves are recommended.

Ingestion 

Symptoms Related to the Physical, Chemical and Toxicological Characteristics:  Skin irritation, eye irritation, 
central nervous system depression, and nerve damage. 

Potential Health Effects (Acute, Chronic, and Delayed) 

Inhalation:  Acute exposure may cause irritation of the mucous membranes, rapid breathing, dizziness, fatigue, 
and headache.  Extreme exposure may cause unconsciousness and respiratory arrest.  Repeated and prolonged 
exposure may cause polyneuropathy. 

Skin Contact:  Short term exposure  may cause irritation with redness.  If sufficient amounts are absorbed, 
systemic toxicity may occur.  Long-term exposure may cause dermatitis due to defatting action. 

Eye Contact:  May cause irritation with redness. 

Ingestion:  Aspiration hazard.  Lung damage may occur if aspirated into the lungs and may be fatal.  Symptoms 
may include coughing, difficulty breathing, cyanosis and pulmonary edema.  May cause diarrhea, fatigue and 
slight central nervous system depression.
