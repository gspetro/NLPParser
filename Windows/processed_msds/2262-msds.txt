3.  COMPOSITION AND INFORMATION ON HAZARDOUS INGREDIENTS 

Substance:  2,2,4-Trimethylpentane 

Other Designations:  Isooctane; isobutyltrimethylmethane 

Note:  This material contains trace amounts of chlorinated biphenyl (CB) [also known as polychlorinated biphenyl 
(PCB)] congeners which have been reported to have toxic, mutagenic, and/or carcinogenic properties, and should 
be  handled  with  care.    The  concentrations  of  these  compounds  that  are  not  listed  in  this  section  are  below  the 
reportable limit for hazardous components (1 % or greater) and carcinogens (0.1 % or greater), required by OSHA, 
29 CFR 1910.1200 (g)(2)(i)(C)(1),  for  SDS  information.    For  actual  concentrations,  see  the  NIST  Certificate  of 
Analysis.

4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Description of First Aid Measures  

Inhalation:    If  adverse  effects  occur,  remove  to  well-ventilated  (uncontaminated)  area.    Give  artificial 
respiration if not breathing.  Get immediate medical attention. 

Skin Contact:  Wash skin with soap and water for at least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing 
and shoes.  Thoroughly clean and dry before reuse. Get medical attention, if needed. 

Eye Contact:  Flush eyes with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes.  Then get immediate medical attention. 

Ingestion:  Aspiration hazard.  Do not induce vomiting.  If vomiting occurs, keep head lower than hips to help 
prevent aspiration.  Get immediate medical attention.  Give artificial respiration if not breathing. 

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  Respiratory tract irritation, aspiration hazard, central 
nervous system depression. 

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above 
symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention.

5.  Fire Fighting Measures 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Severe fire hazard.  The vapor is heavier than air.  Vapor/air mixtures are explosive 
above the flash point.  Vapors or gases may ignite at distant ignition sources and flash back.  See Section 9, “Physical 
and Chemical Properties” for flammability properties. 

Extinguishing Media 
 
 

Suitable:  Regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide, water, or alcohol-resistant foam. 
Unsuitable:  None listed. 

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  Not applicable. 

Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Move container from fire area if it can be 
done without personal risk.  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion by-products.  Wear full protective clothing 
and NIOSH-approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe) 
 

Reactivity = 0 

Health = 2 

Fire = 3 

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Use suitable protective equipment; 
see Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.  Keep out of waters supplies and sewers. 

Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Avoid heat, flames, sparks and other sources of ignition.  
Stop leak if possible without personal risk, with water spray to reduce vapors.  Absorb spilled material with sand or 
non-combustible material and collect in appropriate container for disposal.  

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Safe Handling Precautions:  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”. 

Storage  and  Incompatible  Materials:    Store  in  a  well-ventilated  area.    Keep  separated  from  incompatible 
substances (see Section 10, “Stability and Reactivity”). 

8. EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

Exposure Limits:  No occupational limits established. 

Engineering Controls:  Provide local exhaust or process enclosure ventilation system.  Ensure compliance with 
applicable exposure limits. 

Personal Protection Measures:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal 
Protective Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material. 

Respiratory Protection:  If workplace conditions warrant a respirator, a respiratory protection program 
that meets OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.  Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified 
respirators. 

Eye Protection:  Splash resistant safety goggles and emergency eyewash are recommended. 

Skin and Body Protection:  Chemical resistant clothing and gloves are recommended.
