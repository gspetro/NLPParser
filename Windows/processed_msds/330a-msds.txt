Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration 
or oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Skin Contact:  Wash skin with soap and water. 

Eye Contact:  Flush eyes with water for at least 15 minutes.  If necessary, seek medical attention. 

Ingestion:  If adverse effects occur after ingestion, seek medical treatment. 

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  Prolonged exposure to respirable silica particles can cause 
lung damage (silicosis) and cancer. 

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above 
symptoms are present, seek medical attention if needed. 

5. FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Negligible fire hazard.  Avoid generating dust.  See Section 9, “Physical and Chemical 
Properties” for flammability properties. 

Extinguishing Media: 
 
 

Suitable:  Regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide, water, regular foam. 
Unsuitable:  None listed. 

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  None listed. 

Special  Protective  Equipment  and  Precautions  for  Fire-Fighters:    Avoid  inhalation  of  material  or  combustion 
byproducts.  Wear full protective clothing and NIOSH approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe) 

 

 

Health = 1 

Fire = 0 

Reactivity = 0 

6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Any accumulated material on surfaces 
should be removed and properly disposed of.  Use suitable protective equipment; see Section 8, “Exposure Controls 
and Personal Protection”. 

Methods  and  Materials  for  Containment  and  Clean  up:    Collect  spilled  material  in  appropriate  container  for 
disposal.  Keep out of water supplies and sewers.  Keep unnecessary people away, isolate hazard area and deny entry.

7. HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Safe Handling Precautions:  Minimize dust generation and accumulation on surfaces.  Routine housekeeping should 
be instituted to ensure that dusts do not accumulate on surfaces.   See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal 
Protection”.  Avoid contact with incompatible materials (see Section 10 “Stability and Reactivity”). 

Storage:  Store and handle in accordance with all current regulations and standards.
