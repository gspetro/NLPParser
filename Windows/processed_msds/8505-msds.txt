1.  SUBSTANCE AND SOURCE IDENTIFICATION  

Product Identifier 

RM Number:   8505 
RM Name:  Vanadium in Crude Oil 
Other Means of Identification:  Not applicable. 

Recommended Use of This Material and Restrictions of Use 

This Reference Material (RM) is intended for the use in the calibration of instruments and techniques used for the 
analysis of high vanadium crude oils.  A unit of RM 8505 consists of 250 ml of crude oil in a glass bottle.  This 
crude oil is unrefined and has physical properties similar to residual fuel oil No. 6, with a high flash point 70 °C 
(158 °F), high viscosity, and pour temperature of 12°C.  There is also a trace amount of water present which 
should be handled as described in the NIST Report of Investigation.

4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Description of First Aid Measures  

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  Give artificial respiration if not breathing.  
Get immediate medical attention.  
Skin Contact:  Wash skin with soap and water for at least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing and 
shoes.  Get medical attention, if needed.  Thoroughly clean and dry contaminated clothing and shoes before reuse. 
Eye Contact:  Flush eyes with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes.  Then get immediate medical attention. 
Ingestion:  DO NOT induce vomiting.  If vomiting occurs, keep head lower than hips to help prevent aspiration. 
Get medical attention. 

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed: Irritation, cough, difficulty breathing, dermatitis. 

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above 
symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Suitable:  Regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide, water, or regular foam. 
Unsuitable:  Avoid using straight water streams in order to prevent frothing. 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Moderate fire hazard.  Vapor/air mixtures are explosive above the flash point.  See 
Section 9, “Physical and Chemical Properties” for flammability properties. 
Extinguishing Media 
 
 
Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  Not applicable. 
Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Move container from fire area if it can be done 
without personal risk.  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion by-products.  Wear full protective clothing and 
NIOSH-approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe) 
 

Reactivity = 0 

Health = 1 

Fire = 2 

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Use suitable protective equipment; 
see Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.  Keep out of waters supplies and sewers. 

Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Avoid heat, flames, sparks and other sources of ignition.  
Stop leak if possible without personal risk, with water spray to reduce vapors.  Absorb spilled material with sand or 
non-combustible material and collect in appropriate container for disposal.  

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Safe Handling Precautions:  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”. 

Storage and Incompatible Materials:  Store in a well-ventilated area.  Keep separated from incompatible substances 
(oxidizing materials). 

8.  EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

Exposure Limits:   

NIOSH (REL):   350 mg/m3 (TWA) 
 
 

1800 mg/m3 (Ceiling 15 min) 
1100 ppm (IDLH, 10 % LEL) 

Engineering Controls:   Provide  local  exhaust  or  process  enclosure  ventilation  system.  Ensure  compliance  with 
applicable exposure limits.

Personal Protection Measures:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal 
Protective Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material. 

Respiratory  Protection:    If workplace conditions warrant a  respirator, a  respiratory protection program that 
meets OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.   Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators. 
Eye Protection:  Splash resistant safety goggles and emergency eyewash are recommended. 
Skin and Body Protection:  Chemical resistant clothing and gloves are recommended.
