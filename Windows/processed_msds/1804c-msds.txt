Description:    This  SRM  is  a  primary  gas  mixture  of  thirty  volatile  organic  compounds  in  nitrogen  provided  as  a 
compressed gas in a DOT 3AL specification aluminum (6061alloy) cylinder equipped with a CGA-350 brass valve 
with a nominal pressure exceeding 12.4 MPa (1800 psig).  The cylinder with a water volume of 6 L provides the user 
with 0.73 m3 of useable mixture.  NIST recommends that this cylinder NOT be used below 2.8 MPa (400 psig).

> 99.9 % (a) 

 
(a) Hazardous components 1 % or greater; carcinogens 0.1 % or greater are listed in compliance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.1200 

Note:  SRM 1804c contains trace amounts of 30 different volatile organic compounds (5.0 nmol/mol [ppb] of each), many of 
which have toxic, mutagenic and/or carcinogenic properties and should be handled with care.  None of the toxic volatile organic 
compounds in this mixture exceed OSHA minimum percentages for hazardous compounds or carcinogens and therefore do not 
require  MSDS  information  under  current  regulations.    See  the  Certificate  of  Analysis  for  the  complete  list  of  toxic  volatile 
organic compounds contained in this mixture.  

EC Classification:  Not available. 

EC Risk:  None listed.

Inhalation:    If  adverse  effects  occur,  remove  to  a  well  ventilated  area.    If  breathing  is  difficult,  have  qualified 
personnel give oxygen.  If not breathing, have qualified personnel give artificial respiration.  Get immediate medical 
attention.   

 
4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Skin Contact:  None. 

Eye Contact:  None. 

Ingestion:  Not applicable. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire  and  Explosion  Hazards:    Negligible  fire  hazard  applicable  to  the  identified  NIST  cylinder.    Cylinder  may 
rupture or explode if exposed to heat. 

Extinguishing Media:  Regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide. 

Fire Fighting:  Move cylinder from fire area if it can be done without risk.  Avoid inhalation of material.  Wear full 
protective clothing and NIOSH-approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 

Flash Point (°C):  Not applicable. 

Mehtod used:  Not applicable. 

Autoignition temperature (°C):  Not applicable. 

Flammability Limits in Air (Volume %):  Upper:  Not applicable. 

Lower:  Not applicable. 

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Occupational Release:  Stop leak if possible without personal risk.  Isolate hazard area and deny entry.  Refer to 
Section 13, “Disposal Considerations”. 

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 
Storage:    Store  and  handle  in  accordance  with  all  current  regulations  and  standards.    Secure  cylinder  to  prevent 
physical  damage.    Keep  valve  protective  cap  on  cylinder  when  not  in  use.    Keep  separated  from  incompatible 
substances. Store in a well ventilated area.  Subject to storage regulations:  U.S. OSHA 29 CFR 1910.101. This SRM 
should be stored under normal laboratory conditions within the temperature range of 15 °C and 30 °C. 

Safe Handling Precautions:  Wear safety goggles.  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”. 

8.  EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

Nitrogen Gas 

ACGIH (inhalation):  simple asphyxiant 

Ventilation:    Provide  local  exhaust  or  process  enclosure  ventilation  system.    Ensure  compliance  with  applicable 
exposure limits. 

Respirator:    A  respiratory  protection  program  that  meets  OSHA  29  CFR  and  ANSI  Z88.2  requirements  must  be 
followed  if  workplace  conditions  warrant  a  respirator.    Refer  to  the  “NIOSH  Guide  to  the  Selection  and  Use  of 
Particulate Respirators Certified under 42 CFR 84” for selection and use of respirators certified under NIOSH. 

Eye  Protection:    Wear  safety  goggles.    An  eye  wash  station  should  be  readily  available  near    handling  and  use 
areas. 

Personal Protection:  Wear protective clothing.  Wear safety shoes when moving cylinder(s).

Ingestion 

Health  Effects  (Acute  Exposure):    The  symptoms  of  asphyxia  depend  on  the  rapidity  with  which  the  oxygen 
deficiency develops and how long it continues.  In sudden acute asphyxia, unconsciousness may be immediate. With 
slow development, there may be rapid respiration and pulse, air hunger, dizziness, reduced awareness, tightness in 
the  head,  tingling  sensations,  incoordination,  faulty  judgment,  emotional  instability,  and  rapid  fatigue.    As  the 
asphyxia progresses, nausea, vomiting, collapse, unconsciousness, convulsions, deep coma and death are possible. 

Medical  Conditions  Generally  Aggravated  by  Exposure:    Blood  system  disorders,  heart  or  cardiovascular 
disorders, hormonal disorders, respiratory disorders. 

12.  ECOLOGICAL INFORMATION 

Environmental Summary:  No adverse ecological effects are expected. 

13.  DISPOSAL CONSIDERATIONS 

Waste Disposal:  The cylinder is the property of the purchaser.  Dispose in accordance with all applicable federal, 
state, and local regulations.
