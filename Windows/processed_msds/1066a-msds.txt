4. FIRST AID MEASURES

Description of First Aid Measures: 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  Give artificial respiration if not breathing.  Get immediate medical attention.

Skin Contact:  Wash skin with soap and water for at least 15 minutes.  If necessary, seek medical attention.

Eye Contact:  Flush eyes with water for at least 15 minutes.  If necessary, seek medical attention.

Ingestion:  If a large amount is swallowed, get medical attention.

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  Generated dust may cause mechanical irritation.

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above symptoms are present, seek medical attention if needed.

5. FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Slight fire hazard.  See Section 9, “Physical and Chemical Properties” for flammability properties.

Extinguishing Media

	Suitable:  Use extinguishing agents appropriate for surrounding fire.  

	Unsuitable:  None listed.

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  Not applicable.

Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Move container from fire area if it can be done without personal risk.  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion byproducts.  Wear full protective clothing and NIOSHapproved selfcontained breathing apparatus (SCBA).

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe)

				Health = 0	Fire = 1	Reactivity = 0

6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Any accumulated material on surfaces should be removed and properly disposed of.  Use suitable protective equipment; see Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.

Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Collect spilled material in appropriate container for disposal.  

7. HANDLING AND STORAGE

Safe Handling Precautions:  Use suitable personal protection equipment (PPE).  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.

	Storage and Incompatible Materials:  Store and handle in accordance with all current regulations and standards.  Keep separated from incompatible substances (see Section 10, “Stability and Reactivity”).

8. EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION



Exposure Limits: This material is a particulate matter and adequate inhalation/respiratory protection should be used to minimize exposure.  No occupational exposure limits have been established for fine particulate matter.  The exposure limits for Particulates Not Otherwise Regulated are applicable. 

	OSHA (PEL):	15 mg/m3 (TWA, total particulates) 

		5 mg/m3 (TWA, respirable particulates)

	Engineering Controls:  Provide local exhaust or process enclosure ventilation system.  Ensure compliance with applicable exposure limits.

	Personal Protection Measures:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate PPE to minimize exposure to this material.

	Respiratory Protection:  If workplace conditions warrant a respirator, a respiratory protection program that meets OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.  Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators.

Eye/Face Protection:  Eye and face protection is required when dust is generated.  Wear splash resistant safety goggles.  Provide an emergency eye wash fountain and quick drench shower in the immediate work area.

Skin and Body Protection:  Standard PPE is recommended to avoid irritation.
