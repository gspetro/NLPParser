Irritating to the respiratory tract, skin, eyes, and GI tract. 

Physical Hazards: 

 

 

  Dust-air mixtures may explode. 

Potential Health Effects 

Inhalation: 

The toxicity of this material has not been fully investigated, but lithium compounds 
as a group and cyclohexanebutyric acid are both respiratory irritants. 

Skin Contact: 

Contact with lithium compounds can cause irritation and burns.  
Cyclohexanebutyric acid also causes skin irritation.   

Eye Contact:  

  This material can cause burns and permanent damage to the eyes. 

Ingestion: 

This  material  can  irritate  the  GI  tract,  causing  abdominal  pain,  nausea,  vomiting, 
and diarrhea.  High-level or prolonged exposure to lithium compounds may damage 
the  kidneys,  central  nervous  system,  or  other  organs.    Cyclohexanebutyric  acid  is 
also an irritant.

4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

 
Inhalation:  Move the person to fresh air immediately.  If not breathing, qualified medical personnel may start CPR 
or give oxygen if necessary.  Get medical aid at once, and bring the container or label. 
 
Skin Contact:  Remove contaminated clothing and shoes.  Flush affected skin with water for at least 15 minutes, 
then  wash  thoroughly  with  soap  and  water.    If  skin  irritation  persists,  get  medical  aid  and  bring  the  container  or 
label.  Wash contaminated clothing before reusing. 
 
Eye Contact:  Remove contact lenses (if any).  Do not allow victim to rub eyes or keep eyes closed.  Flush eyes 
with  large  amounts  of  running  water  for  at  least  30  minutes,  keeping  eyelids  open  and  raising  lids  to  remove  all 
chemical.  Get medical aid at once, and bring the container or label.   
 
Ingestion:  Contact a poison control center immediately for instructions.  Wash out mouth with water, but do not 
induce vomiting.  Get medical aid at once, and bring the container or label. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

 
Fire and Explosion Hazards:  This material is not believed to be a significant fire hazard under normal conditions.  
Dust-air mixtures may explode if an ignition source is present.  Products of combustion may be toxic.   

Extinguishing  Media:    Use extinguishing  media  appropriate  to  the  surrounding  fire,  such  as  water  spray,  carbon 
dioxide, dry chemical, or foam.  Cool containers from maximum distance using water spray. 

Fire Fighting:  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion byproducts.  Wear full protective clothing and NIOSH-
approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 

Flash Point (°C):  N/A 

Autoignition (°C):  N/A 

Lower Explosive Limit (LEL):  N/A 

Upper Explosive Limit (UEL):  N/A 

Flammability Class (OSHA):  N/A 

Products of Combustion:  Thermal decomposition of this material can release carbon oxides and lithium oxide. 

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

 
Occupational  Release:    Isolate  the  spill  area  and  remove  any  sources  of  ignition.    Cleanup  personnel  must  wear 
personal  protective  equipment  (“Section  8”).    Sweep  up  material  and  place  in  a  suitable  container  for  proper 
disposal, using a method that does not generate dust.  Provide ventilation. 

Disposal:  Refer to “Section 13”, Disposal Considerations.

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

 
Storage:    Store  this  material  in  the  original  container  at  room  temperature.    Protect  from  moisture,  heat,  and 
physical damage, and isolate from incompatible materials.   
 
Safe Handling Precautions:  Wear a dust mask or respirator.  Avoid contact or wash after handling. 
 

8.  EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

Exposure Limits:  
 
  ACGIH TLV-TWA:  None established.  Total nuisance dust, 10 mg/m3; respirable dust, 3 mg/m3  
  OSHA TLV-TWA:  None established.  Total nuisance dust, 15 mg/m3; respirable dust, 5 mg/m3  
  UK WEL: None established. Total inhalable dust, 10 mg/m3; respirable dust, 4 mg/m3 
 
Ventilation:  Use local or general exhaust to keep employee exposures below limits.  Local exhaust ventilation is 
preferred  because  it  can  control  contaminant  emissions  at  the  source,  preventing  dispersion  into  the  general  work 
area.  Refer to the ACGIH document Industrial Ventilation, a Manual of Recommended Practices. 
 
Respirator:  If necessary, refer to the NIOSH document Guide to the Selection and Use of Particulate Respirators 
Certified under 42 CFR 84 for selection and use of respirators certified by NIOSH. 
 
Eye  Protection:    Use  chemical  safety  goggles  where  dusting  or  splashing  of  solutions  may  occur.    See  OSHA 
standard (29 CFR 1910.133) or European Standard EN166.  The employer should provide an emergency eye wash 
fountain and safety shower in the immediate work area. 
 
Personal Protection:  Wear appropriate gloves and protective clothing to prevent contact with skin.

    X    Skin 

    X    Ingestion 

     X    Inhalation  

Route of Entry:   
 
Toxicity Data (Lithium): 
 
  Rabbit, subcutaneous, LDLo:  4 g/kg 
  Mouse, intraperitoneal, LD50:  1 g/kg 
  Dog, intravenous, LDLo:  325 mg/kg 
 
Target Organ(s):  Respiratory tract, skin, eyes, GI tract, kidneys, central nervous system. 
 
Mutagen/Teratogen:    Lithium  can  induce  birth  defects  in  mice,  but  only  at  extremely  high  doses  that  humans 
would  not  normally  encounter.    Some  studies  suggest  that  lithium  is  associated  with  a  slight  risk  of  fetal  heart 
defects in humans.  Lithium may also reduce sperm motility in humans.   
 
Health Effects:  See “Section 3”. 

12.  ECOLOGICAL INFORMATION 

 
Environmental  Summary:    The  environmental  effects  of  lithium  and  its  compounds  have  not  been  fully 
investigated.  No relevant ecotoxicity data were found. 

13.  DISPOSAL CONSIDERATIONS 

 
Waste  Disposal:    Dispose  of  container  and  unused  contents  in  accordance  with  federal,  state,  and  local 
requirements,  which  vary  according  to  location.   Although  this  material  is  not  a  listed  RCRA  hazardous  waste,  it 
may  exhibit  one  or  more  characteristics  of  a  hazardous  waste  and  thus  requires  appropriate  analysis  to  determine 
specific  disposal  requirements.    Processing,  use,  or  contamination  of  this  product  may  change  the  waste 
management options.
