Warning:    THIS  MATERIAL  SHOULD  ONLY  BE  USED  BY  PERSONS  QUALIFIED  TO  HANDLE 
RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL!   

SRM  4361C  is  a  radioactive  material,  Hydrogen-3,  with  a  massic  activity  of  approximately  2  Bq•g-1.  
Hydrogen-3 decays by beta-particle emission.  During the decay process no photons are emitted. 

This product contains licensed radioactive material and is therefore subject to the requirements of 10 CFR Part 20 
(e.g., public and occupational exposure limits, waste disposal).  At a minimum, the basic radiation safety principles 
of  time,  distance,  and  shielding,  and  appropriate  radiation  contamination  control  should  be  practiced  to 
avoid/minimize any external and/or internal exposure.  Consult with your Radiation Safety office for your facility’s 
radiation safety requirements/precautions specific to the radionuclide(s) (including its activity and chemical/physical 
form) in this Radioactive SRM.

4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Description of First Aid Measures:  

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  Seek medical attention. 

Skin Contact:  Rinse affected area with copious amounts of water followed by washing with soap and water for 
at least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing.  Seek medical attention, if needed. 

Eye Contact:  Immediately flush eyes, including under the eyelids with  copious amounts of water for at least 
30 minutes.  Seek immediate medical attention.

The following is a guide for first responders.  The following actions, including remediation, should be carried out by 
qualified individuals.  In cases where a life-threatening injury occurs concurrent with personal contamination, treat 
the injury first.   
Do not touch damaged packages or spilled material.  Handle as a radioactive material spill.  In addition to those actions 
described below, the guidelines in the Emergency Response Guidebook (ERG) provide more specific measures that 
should be followed. 

Spill and Leak Control: 

Alert and clear everyone from the area affected by the spill. 
Take actions to limit the spread of contamination.  
Summon aid.
