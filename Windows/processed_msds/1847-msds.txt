Description:    This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  a  set  of  three  levels  of  ethanol  in  water  at  a  nominal 
concentrations  of  2 %,  6 %,  and  25 %  by  mass.    This  SRM  is  intended  primarily  for  use  in  the  calibration  of 
instruments  and  techniques  used  for  the  determination  of  ethanol  in  breath.    SRM 1847  consists  of  six  10 mL 
ampoules,  (two  ampoules  each  of  the  nominal  concentrations  of  2 %,  6 %,  and  25 %  by  mass)  each  ampoule 
contains approximately 10 mL of solution. 

Other Designations:  Ethyl alcohol; grain alcohol; ethyl hydroxide; ethyl hydrate; algrain; methyl carbinol; cologne 
spirits; fermentation alcohol; absolute alcohol; UN1170; C2H5OH. 

Substance:  Ethanol/Water Solutions 

2.  HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Note:  Each of these solutions is a mixture of ethanol and water.  This MSDS contains health and safety information 
for ethanol. 
Major  Health  Hazards:    Respiratory  tract  irritation,  skin  irritation,  eye  irritation,  liver  damage,  central  nervous 
system depression.

Reactivity = 0 

Fire = 3 

Potential Health Effects (Acute and Chronic) 

Inhalation:    Irritation  of  mucous  membranes,  headache,  drowsiness,  fatigue,  nervousness,  dullness,  narcosis, 
lack  of  concentration,  somnolence,  symptoms  of  drunkenness.    Reproductive  effects  have  been  reported  in 
animals.  

Skin  Contact:    Irritation,  mild  redness  and  burning,  sensitization,  allergic,  contact  dermatitis.    Chronic 
exposure may result in defatting of the skin.  

Eye Contact:  Irritation, conjunctivitis, corneal cloudiness. 

Ingestion:    Headache,  drowsiness,  emotional  lability,  decreased  inhibitions,  exhilaration,  boastfulness, 
talkativeness,  remorse,  belligerency,  gradual  visual  impairment,  muscular  incoordination,  slurring  of  speech, 
symptoms of drunkenness; long term may result in liver damage.  Reproductive effects have been reported in 
animals.

4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

EC Risk/Safety Phrases:  See Section 15, “Regulatory Information”. 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration by 
qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention. 
Skin  Contact:    Rinse  affected  area  with  soap  and  water  for  at  least  15 minutes.    Seek  medical  assistance  if 
necessary. 
Eye Contact:  Immediately flush eyes, including under the eyelids, with copious amounts of water for at least 15 
minutes.  Seek immediate medical attention. 
Ingestion:  Contact local poison control center or physician immediately.  Never make an unconscious person vomit 
or drink fluids.  If vomiting occurs, keep head lower than hips to prevent aspiration.  If person is unconscious, turn 
head to side.  Get medical attention immediately. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Severe fire hazard.  Vapor is heavier than air.  Vapors or gases may ignite at distant 
ignition sources and flash back.  Vapor/air mixtures are explosive above flash point. 
Extinguishing Media:  Regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide, fine water spray, and alcohol resistant foam. 
Fire Fighting:  Avoid inhalation of combustion by-products. 

Flash Point (C):  29 (84 F) for a 30 % ethanol/water solution. 
Method Used:  Closed cup. 

Autoignition Temperature (C):  363 (685.4 F) for ethanol.

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Occupational Release:  Absorb with sand or other non-combustible material and collect in appropriate container for 
proper disposal. 
Disposal:  Refer to Section 13, “Disposal Considerations”. 

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Storage:  Store and handling in accordance with all current regulations and standards. 
Safe Handling Precautions:  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.

Respirator:    If  workplace  conditions  warrant  a  respirator,  a  respiratory  protection  program  that  meets  OSHA 
29 CFR 1910.134 must be followed.  Refer to NIOSH 24 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators. 
Eye Protection:  Wear safety goggles.  An eyewash station and drench shower should be readily available near the 
handling and use areas. 

Personal Protection:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal Protective 
Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material.
