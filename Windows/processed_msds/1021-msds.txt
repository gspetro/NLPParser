1021 
Glass Beads - Particle Size Distribution 

Recommended Use of This Material and Restrictions of Use 

This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended for use in the evaluation and calibration of equipment used to 
measure  particle  size  distributions  (PSD)  in  the  2  µm  to  12  µm  diameter  range.    Typical  methods  for  PSD 
determination  would  be  laser  light  scattering  (LLS),  electrical  sensing  zone  (ESZ),  and  sedimentation.    A  unit  of 
SRM 1021 consists of a single bottle containing approximately 4 g of solid spherical soda-lime glass beads.

4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Description of First Aid Measures:  

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration 
or oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Skin Contact:  Wash skin with soap and water. 

Eye Contact:  Flush eyes with water for at least 15 minutes.  If necessary, seek medical attention. 

Ingestion:  If adverse effects occur after ingestion, seek medical treatment. 

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  May cause irritation.  

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above 
symptoms are present, seek medical attention if needed. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Negligible fire hazard.  Avoid generating dust.  See Section 9, “Physical and Chemical 
Properties” for flammability properties. 

Extinguishing Media: 
 
 

Suitable:  Use extinguishing media appropriate for surrounding fire. 
Unsuitable:  None listed. 

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  None listed. 

Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion 
byproducts.  Wear full protective clothing and NIOSH approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe)  

 

Health = 1 

Fire = 0 

Reactivity = 0 

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Personal  Precautions,  Protective  Equipment  and  Emergency  Procedures:    Any  accumulated  material  on 
surfaces should be removed and properly disposed of.  Use suitable protective equipment; see Section 8, “Exposure 
Controls and Personal Protection”. 

Methods  and  Materials  for  Containment  and  Clean  up:    Collect  spilled  material  in  appropriate  container  for 
disposal.  Keep out of water supplies and sewers.  Keep unnecessary people away, isolate hazard area and deny entry. 

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Safe Handling Precautions:  Minimize dust generation and accumulation on surfaces.  Routine housekeeping should 
be instituted to ensure that dusts do not accumulate on surfaces.  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal 
Protection”. 

Storage:  Store and handling in accordance with all current regulations and standards.   

8.  EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

Exposure  Limits:    No  occupational  exposure  limits  have  been  established  for  glass  beads.    This  material  is  a 
particulate matter and adequate inhalation/respiratory protection should be used to minimize exposure.  The exposure 
limits for Particulates Not Otherwise Regulated (PNOR) are applicable. 

OSHA (PEL):  15 mg/m3 (TWA, total particulates not otherwise regulated) 
OSHA (PEL) 

5 mg/m3 (TWA, respirable particulates not otherwise regulated) 

NIOSH (REL):  10 mg/m3 (TWA, total particulates not otherwise regulated, 8 h) 
NIOSH (REL):  5 mg/m3 (TWA, respirable particulates not otherwise regulated) 

Engineering Controls:   Provide  local  exhaust  or  process  enclosure  ventilation  system.  Ensure  compliance  with 
applicable exposure limits. 

Personal Protection:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal Protective 
Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material. 

Respiratory Protection:    If workplace conditions warrant a respirator, a respiratory protection program that meets 

SRM 1021 

 

Page 2 of 5 

OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.   Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators. 

Eye/Face Protection:  Wear splash resistant safety goggles with a face shield.  An eye wash station should be readily 
available near areas of use. 

Skin and Body Protection:  Personal protective equipment for the body should be selected based on the task being 
performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a specialist before handling this product.  Chemical-
resistant gloves should be worn at all times when handling chemicals.
