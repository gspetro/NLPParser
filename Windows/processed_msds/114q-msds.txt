Ingestion 

Symptoms Related to the Physical, Chemical and Toxicological Characteristics:  Eye damage, skin irritation, and 
skin sensitization.  May damage mucous membranes.  May aggravate respiratory disorders.   

Potential Health Effects (Acute, Chronic, and Delayed) 

Inhalation:  Irritation, cough, and phlegm.  Prolonged or repeated exposure to mixed cement dusts may cause 
cough, expectoration, dyspnea, wheezing, pharyngitis, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, cement pneumoconiosis, 
and silicosis. 
Skin  Contact:    Irritation  (possibly  severe)  and  dermatitis.    Direct  content  with  wet  cement,  combined  with 
prolonged  contact  time  and  pressure  may  cause ulcerations  and  possibly  burns.   Sensitivity  to  constituents  of 
cement may induce allergic skin reactions (chromium compounds). 
Eye Contact:  Irritation, visual disturbances, eye damage.  In addition, wet cement may cause a burning sensation, 
corneal edema indicated by seeing halos around lights, and injury to the conjunctiva. 
Ingestion:  Irritation (long-term) and possible gastroduodenal ulcers. 

Numerical Measures of Toxicity 

Acute toxicity:  Not classified. 

Portland cement:  No data available. 
Quartz:  Rat, Oral LD50: 500 mg/kg 

Skin corrosion/irritation:  Category 2, Irritation.

of moisture. 

Serious eye damage/eye irritation:  Category 1, Serious eye damage. 

Exposure to portland cement dust may cause severe eye damage and burns in the presence of moisture. 

Respiratory sensitization:  Classification not possible; no data available. 
 

Portland  cement  may  contain  trace  amounts  of  hexavalent  chromium  compounds  which  may  cause 
respiratory effects. 

Skin Sensitization:  Classification not possible; no data available. 
 

Portland cement may contain trace amounts of hexavalent chromium compounds which may cause allergic 
skin reactions. 

Germ Cell Mutagenicity:  No data available.
