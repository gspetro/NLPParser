1641e 
Mercury in Water 

Recommended Use of This Material and Restrictions of Use 

This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended for the calibration of instruments and techniques used for 
the determination of mercury in natural waters.  It is designed for the preparation of calibration solutions and for 
use  as  a  “spike”  sample  in  a  “method-of-additions”  analytical  procedure.    A  unit  of  SRM 1641e  consists  of 
10 ampoules, each ampoule containing approximately 10 mL of solution comprised of a trace amount of mercury 
in  approximately  3 %  mass  fraction  nitric  acid  and  2 %  mass  fraction  hydrochloric  acid,  equivalent  to 
amount-of-substance  concentration  (molarity)  values  of  approximately  0.5 mol/L  nitric  acid  and  0.5 mol/L 
hydrochloric acid.

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration 
or oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Skin Contact:  Wash skin with soap and water for at least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing and 
shoes.  Get immediate medical attention.  Thoroughly clean and dry contaminated clothing before reuse. 

Eye Contact:  Immediately flush eyes, including under the eyelids with copious amounts of water for at least 
15 minutes.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Ingestion:  Contact a poison control center immediately for instructions.  Give water to rinse out mouth.  Never 
give liquids to a person with reduced awareness or becoming unconscious.  If vomiting occurs, keep head lower 
than hips to prevent aspiration.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate 
medical attention. 

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  Acid burns to skin, eyes, and lungs. 

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above 
symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention. 

5. FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES

Ingestion 

Symptoms Related to the Physical, Chemical and Toxicological Characteristics:  Burning pain and severe skin 
corrosion, and eye damage. 

Inhalation:  Hydrochloric acid and nitric acid can damage the mucous membranes and upper respiratory tract.  
Short term exposure may cause irritation and inflammation of the upper respiratory tract, coughing, choking, sore 
throat, shortness of breath, headache, dizziness, and nausea.  Long term exposure to acid fumes may cause damage 
to teeth, bronchial irritation, chronic cough, bronchial pneumonia, and gastrointestinal disturbances.   
Skin Contact:  Hydrochloric acid and nitric acid can cause severe skin burns.  Severity of the damage depends 
on the concentration and duration of exposure.  Effects of acid burns may be delayed.   
Eye Contact:  Hydrochloric acid and nitric acid can cause severe eye irritation, corneal burns, permanent eye 
damage, or blindness.  Severity of the damage depends on the concentration and duration of exposure.   
Ingestion:  If ingested, concentrated hydrochloric acid and nitric acid can cause burns to the gastrointestinal tract.
