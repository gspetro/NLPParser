NFPA Ratings (Scale 0–4):  Health = 2 

Fire = 4 

Reactivity = 0 

Major  Health  Hazards:    Natural  gas  is  a  simple  asphyxiant.    Inhallation  of  the  gas  may  result  in  difficulty 
breathing, dizziness, tingling sensations or nausea and vomiting.    

Physical  Hazards:    Natural  gas  is  extremely  flammable.    Cylinder  may  rupture  or  explode  if  exposed  to  heat  or 
flame. 

Potential Health Effects (Short Term Exposure) 

Inhalation:  May result in difficulty breathing, dizziness, tingling sensations, nausea and vomiting. 

Skin Contact:  Sudden release may result in frostbite. 

Eye Contact:  No information on significant adverse effects. 

Ingestion:  Ingestion of a gas is unlikely. 

Listed as a Carcinogen/Potential Carcinogen  

 
In the National Toxicology Program (NTP) Report on Carcinogens 
In the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Monographs 
By the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)

4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Eye Contact:  Not applicable. 

Ingestion:  Not applicable. 
 
5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

 

 

Inhalation:  If breathing is difficult, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, have qualified personnel give 
artificial respiration and seek immediate medical attention. 

Skin Contact:  In case of frostbite, immediately flush with plenty of luke warm water.  Seek medical attention. 

Fire  and  Explosion  Hazards:    Severe  fire  hazard.    Vapor/air  mixtures  are  explosive.    Cylinder  may  rupture  or 
explode if exposed to heat or flame. 

Extinguishing Media:  Regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide. 

Fire Fighting:  Move cylinder from fire area if it can be done without personal risk.  Avoid inhalation of material.  
Wear full protective clothing and NIOSH-approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 

Flash Point (°C):  −180 

Method Used:  Not listed 

Autoignition Temp (°C):  482 – 670  

Flammabillity Limits in Air (Volume %): 

Upper:  3.8 – 6.5 % 

Lower:  13 – 17 % 

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Occupational Release:  Stop leak if possible without personal risk.  Isolate hazard area and deny entry.  Refer to 
Section 13, “Disposal Considerations”. 

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Storage:  Store and handle in accordance with all current regulations and standards.  RM 8560 should be stored in 
accordance with the Storage and Handling instructions in the NIST Report of Investigation.  Store away from sparks, 
heat  or  other  sources  of  ignition.    Keep  separated  from  incompatible  substances.  Store  in  a  well  ventilated  area.  
Subject to storage regulations:  U.S. OSHA 29 CFR 1910.101. 

Safe Handling Precautions:   See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”. 

8.  EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

Natural gas  

OSHA TWA (inhalation):  1800 mg/m3 (1000 ppm) 
NIOSH TWA (10 hours):  1800 mg/m3 (1000 ppm) 
UK WEL TWA (inhalation):  1750 mg/m3 (1000 ppm) 

Ventilation:    Provide  local  exhaust  or  process  enclosure  ventilation  system.    Ensure  compliance  with  applicable 
exposure limits. 

Respirator:    A  respiratory  protection  program  that  meets  OSHA  29  CFR  and  ANSI  Z88.2  requirements  must  be 
followed  if  workplace  conditions  warrant  a  respirator.    Refer  to  the  “NIOSH  Guide  to  the  Selection  and  Use  of 
Particulate Respirators Certified under 42 CFR 84” for selection and use of respirators certified under NIOSH. 

Eye  Protection:    Not  required,  but  recommended.    An  eye  wash  station  should  always  be  available  and  easily 
accessable. 

Personal Protection:  Protective clothing is not required.

Health Effects: 

Acute Exposure:  The amount of natural gas supplied by RM 8560 (2 g) is unlikely to result in acute asphyxia.  The 
following symptoms are provided as general information. 

Simple Asphyxiants:  The symptoms of asphyxia depend on the rapidity with which the oxygen deficiency develops 
and how long it continues.  In sudden acute asphyxia, unconsciousness may be immediate. With slow development, 
there  may  be  rapid  respiration  and  pulse,  air  hunger,  dizziness,  reduced  awareness,  tightness  in  the  head,  tingling 
sensations,  incoordination,  faulty  judgment,  emotional  instability,  and  rapid  fatigue.    As  the  asphyxia  progresses, 
nausea, vomiting, collapse, unconsciousness, convulsions, deep coma and death are possible. 

Chronic Exposure:  No data listed. 

Medical Conditions Generally Aggravated by Exposure:  None listed. 
 
12.  ECOLOGICAL INFORMATION 

Environmental Summary:  No data listed. 

13.  DISPOSAL CONSIDERATIONS 

Waste Disposal:  The cylinder is the property of the purchaser.  Dispose in accordance with all applicable federal, 
state, and local regulations.  Natural gas is subject to disposal regulations:  U.S. EPA 40 CFR 262, Hazardous Waste 
Number(s):  D00l.
