SAFETY DATA SHEET



1. Substance and Source Identification 

	Product Identifier

	SRM Number:  3002

	SRM Name:  Ethylbenzene in Methanol

	Other Means of Identification:  Not applicable.

	Recommended Use of This Material and Restrictions of Use

This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is a gravimetrically prepared singlecompound solution (ethylbenzene) in methanol intended primarily for the calibration of instrumentation and validation of methods for volatile organic compound (VOC) determinations.  Because of its miscibility with water, this SRM can also be used to fortify samples with known amounts of the VOC.  A unit of SRM 3002 consists of two 5 mL sealed borosilicate glass ampoules of a gravimetrically prepared solution of ethylbenzene in methanol.  Approximately 2.5 mL of this SRM mixture is supplied in each 5 mL glass ampoule.

4. FIRST AID MEASURES

Description of First Aid Measures 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to wellventilated (uncontaminated) area.  If breathing is difficult, qualified personnel may administer oxygen.  If not breathing, qualified personnel should give artificial respiration.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Skin Contact:  Rinse affected skin with water for at least 15 minutes, then wash thoroughly with soap or mild detergent and water.  If skin irritation persists, seek medical aid and bring the container or label.

Eye Contact:  Immediately flush eyes, including under the eyelids, with copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes.  Seek immediate medical attention.

Ingestion:  If ingested, seek medical attention.

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed

	Inhalation:  Irritation, dizziness, tingling sensation, pain in extremities, tremors, loss of coordination, difficulty breathing, irregular heartbeat, visual disturbances, blindness, bluish skin color, convulsions, unconsciousness, and coma.

	Skin Contact:  Irritation.

	Eye Contact:  Irritation.
