2627a 
Nitric Oxide in Nitrogen (Nominal Amount-of-Substance Fraction 5 µmol/mol) 

Recommended Use of This Material and Restrictions of Use 

This  Standard  Reference  Material  (SRM)  is  a  primary  gas  mixture  of  nitric  oxide  in  nitrogen  supplied  in  a 
DOT 3AL-specification aluminum (6061 alloy) cylinder with a water volume of 6 L.  Mixtures are shipped with 
a nominal pressure exceeding 11.0 MPa (1600 psig), which provides the user with 0.73 m3 (25.8 ft3) of useable 
mixture.  The cylinder is the property of the purchaser and is equipped with a CGA-660 stainless steel valve, 
which is the recommended outlet for this nitric oxide mixture.

personnel.    Keep  unnecessary  personnel  away.    Use  suitable  protective  equipment;  see  Section 8,  “Exposure 
Controls  and  Personal  Protection”.    Shut  off  gas  supply  if  this  can  be  done  safely.    Isolate  area  until  gas  has 
dispersed.  

Methods  and  Materials  for  Containment  and  Clean  up:    Stop  leak  if  possible  without  personal  risk.    Isolate 
hazard area and deny entry.  Ventilate closed spaces before entering. 

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Safe Handling Precautions:  Secure  cylinder  to  prevent  physical  damage.    Close  valve  after  each  use  and  when 
empty.  Keep valve protection cap on cylinder when not in use.   

Storage:    Store  and  handling  in  accordance  with  all  current  regulations  and  standards.    Keep  separated  from 
incompatible substances.  Store in well-ventilated area.  Subject to storage regulations, OSHA 29 CFR 1910.101.

Personal Protection Measures:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal 
Protective Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material. 

Respiratory Protection:    If workplace conditions warrant a respirator, a respiratory protection program that meets 
OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.   Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators. 

Eye/Face  Protection:    Wear  splash  resistant  safety  goggles  with  a  face  shield.  An  eye  wash  station  should  be 
readily available near areas of use. 

Skin  and  Body  Protection:    Personal  protective  equipment  for  the  body  should  be  selected  based  on  the  task 
being  performed  and  the  risks  involved  and  should  be  approved  by  a  specialist  before  handling  this  product. 
Chemical-resistant gloves should be worn at all times when handling chemicals.

Ingestion 

Symptoms Related to the Physical, Chemical and Toxicological Characteristics:  Nausea, headache, weakness, 
drowsiness. 

Potential Health Effects (Acute, Chronic and Delayed): 

Inhalation:   
Nitric  oxide:    Acute  exposure  to  nitric  oxide  at  low  concentrations  in  a  one-time  exposure  may  cause  mild 
coughing,  respiratory  tract  irritation,  fatigue,  headache,  nausea  and  vomiting  choking  abdominal  pain,  and 
dyspnea.  Exposure to 25 ppm for 60 minutes may cause irritation and minor chest pain; 50 ppm may lead to 
pulmonary edema with possible recovery; 100 ppm may cause pulmonary edema and death. 

Nitrogen:    Nitrogen  compressed  gas  is  a  simple  asphyxiant.    Release  in  an  enclosed  space  may  result  in 
asphyxiation.  The symptoms of asphyxia depend on the rapidity  with  which the oxygen deficiency develops 
and  how  long  it  continues.    In  sudden  acute  asphyxia,  unconsciousness  may  be  immediate.    With  slow 
development, there  may be rapid respiration and pulse, air  hunger, dizziness, reduced awareness, tightness in 
the head, tingling sensations, incoordination, faulty judgment, emotional instability, and rapid fatigue.  As the 
asphyxia  progresses,  nausea,  vomiting,  collapse,  unconsciousness,  convulsions,  deep  coma,  and  death  are 
possible.  

Skin Contact:  Nitric oxide at low concentrations may cause skin irritation. 

Eye  Contact:    Nitric  oxide  at  low  concentrations  in  air  may  cause  a  stinging  sensation  of  the  eyes.    Not 
applicable for exposure to nitrogen. 

Ingestion:  Ingestion of a gas is unlikely under normal conditions of use.
