SRM 1635 consists of 75 g of finely powdered coal ground to pass a 230 μm sieve and homogenized. 
 
Substance:  Coal Powder 

Other Designations:  Subbituminous coal; ground subbituminous coal, coal dust.

NOTE:    The  material’s  average  particle  size,  as  manufactured,  is  above  the  inhalation  or  respirable  size  limits 
(100 µm or 100 microns, inhalation; 10 µm or 10 microns, respirable) established by the ACGIH, Appendix D.  This 
material  contains  various  other  elements  (see  Certificate  of  Analysis),  which  have  been  reported  to  have  toxic, 
mutagenic,  and/or  carcinogenic  properties,  and  should  be  handled  with  care.    The  concentrations  of  the  ones  not 
listed above are below the reportable limit:  hazardous components (1 %); carcinogens (0.1 %), required by OSHA, 
29 CFR 1910.1200 (g)(2)(i)(C)(1), for MSDS information.

EC Safety (S No.):  Not assigned. 

4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

EC Risk/Safety Phrases:  See Section 15, “Regulatory Information”. 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area. If not breathing, give artificial respiration by 
qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Skin  Contact:    Rinse  affected  area  with  soap  and  water  for  at  least  15 minutes.    Seek  medical  assistance  if 
necessary. 

Eye  Contact:    Immediately  flush  eyes,  including  under  the  eyelids,  with  copious  amounts  of  water  for  at  least 
15 minutes.  Seek immediate medical attention.  

Ingestion:  If a large amount is swallowed, seek medical attention. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Slight fire hazard.  Dust/air mixtures may ignite or explode.

8.  EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

Exposure Limits: 

Coal Dust: 

OSHA PEL (TWA):  2.4 mg/m3 (respirable, SiO2, dust fraction <5 % total dust) 
OSHA PEL (TWA):  10 mg/m3/(%SiO2 + 2) (respirable, SiO2, dust fraction >5 % total dust) 
NIOSH REL (TWA):  1 mg/m3 [measured according to MSHA method (CPSU)] 
NIOSH REL (TWA):  0.9 mg/m3 (measured according to ISO/CEN/ACGIH criteria) 
ACGIH (TWA):  0.9 mg/m3 (respirable, SiO2, dust fraction <5 % total dust) 

Ventilation:  Local exhaust ventilation system. 

Respirator:    If  workplace  conditions  warrant  a  respirator,  a  respiratory  protection  program  that  meets 
OSHA 29 CFR 1910.134 must be followed.  Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators. 

Eye Protection:  Wear safety goggles.  An eye wash station and drench shower should be readily available near the 
handling and use areas. 

Personal Protection:  Chemically resistant gloves and clothing are recommended.
