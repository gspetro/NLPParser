4. FIRST AID MEASURES

Description of First Aid Measures: 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration or oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention.

Skin Contact:  Wash skin with soap and water for at least 15 minutes.  If necessary, seek medical attention.

Eye Contact:  Flush eyes with water for at least 15 minutes.  If necessary, seek medical attention.

Ingestion:  If a large amount is swallowed, seek medical attention.

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  Respiratory tract irritation, skin irritation, allergic reactions, suspect cancer hazard (in animals).

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above symptoms are present, seek medical attention if needed.

5. FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Negligible fire hazard.  Dust/air mixtures may ignite or explode.  See Section 9, “Physical and Chemical Properties” for flammability properties.

Extinguishing Media:

		Suitable:  Use extinguishing agents appropriate for surrounding fire.

		Unsuitable:  None listed.

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  Gives off irritating or toxic fumes (or gases) in a fire.

Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion byproducts.  Wear full protective clothing and NIOSH approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA).

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe)	

				Health = 2	Fire = 0	Reactivity = 0

6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Avoid generating dust.    Keep out of water supplies and sewers.  Keep unnecessary personnel away.  Use suitable protective equipment; see Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.

Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Notify safety personnel of spills.  Collect spilled material in appropriate container for disposal.  Isolate hazard area and deny entry.  Subject to California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (Proposition 65).


7. HANDLING AND STORAGE

Safe Handling Precautions: See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.

Storage:  Store and handle in accordance with all current regulations and standards.  Keep separated from incompatible substances (See Section 10, “Stability and Reactivity”).

8. EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION

Exposure Limits:

	NIOSH (REL):	0.2 mg/m3 (TWA) as Ni inhalable fraction (related to Nickel, inorganic compounds, insoluble)

		ACGIH (TLV):	0.2 mg/m3 (TWA)

		OSHA (PEL):	15 mg/m3 (TWA, total particulates not otherwise regulated)

			5 mg/m3 (TWA, total particulates not otherwise regulated)

Engineering Controls:  Provide local exhaust or process enclosure ventilation system.  Ensure compliance with applicable exposure limits.

Personal Protection:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material.

Respiratory Protection:  If workplace conditions warrant a respirator, a respiratory protection program that meets OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.  Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators.

Eye/Face Protection:  Wear chemical resistant safety goggles.  An eyewash station should be readily available near areas of use.

Skin and Body Protection:  Personal protective equipment for the body should be selected based on the task being performed.  Chemical-resistant clothing and gloves should be worn at all times when handling chemicals.
