4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

 

Inhalation: 

If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area. Give artificial respiration, 
if not breathing, by qualified personnel.  Get immediate medical attention. 

Skin Contact: 

Rinse  affected  area  with  copious  amounts  of  water  for  at  least  15  minutes  while 
removing contaminated clothing.  Get medical attention, if needed. 

Eye Contact: 

Flush eyes, including under the eyelids, with copious amounts of water for at least 
15 minutes.  Get immediate medical attention. 

Ingestion: 

Get immediate medical attention.  If vomiting occurs, keep head lower than hips to 
prevent  aspiration.    Give  artificial  respiration,  if  not  breathing,  by  qualified 
personnel. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

 Fire and Explosion Hazards: 

Ephedrine is a moderate fire hazard. 

Extinguishing Media: 

Regular dry chemical.  Carbon dioxide.  Water.  Regular foam. 

Fire Fighting: 

Move  container  from  fire  area  if  it  can  be  done  without  risk.    Use  extinguishing 
media  appropriate  for  the  surrounding  fire.    Wear  full  protective  clothing  and 
NIOSH-approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA).

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Occupational Release: 

Collect small spilled material in an appropriate container for disposal.  Keep out of 
water supplies and sewers. 

Disposal: 

Refer to Section 13, “Disposal Considerations”. 

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Storage: 

Store and handle in accordance with all current regulations and standards.  Store in 
a cool, dry place. 

  Safe Handling Precautions: 

See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”. 

8.  EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

Exposure Limits: 

Ephedrine:  No occupational exposure limits established. 

Ventilation: 

Provide  local exhaust ventilation system. 

Respirator: 

If  necessary,  refer  to  the  “NIOSH  Guide  to  the  Selection  and  Use  of  Particulate 
Respirators  Certified  under  42  CFR  84”  for  selection  and  use  of  respirators  with 
organic vapor cartridges certified by NIOSH. 

Eye Protection: 

Wear safety goggles.  An eye wash station should be readily available near areas 
of use. 

Personal Protection: 

Wear  appropriate  protective  clothing  and  chemically  resistant  gloves  to  prevent 
skin exposure.
