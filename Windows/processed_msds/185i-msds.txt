SRM Name: 

185i 
Potassium Hydrogen Phthalate 
pH Standard 

Other Means of Identification:  Not applicable. 

Recommended Use of This Material and Restrictions of Use 

This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended for use in preparing solutions for calibrating electrodes for 
pH  measuring  systems.    SRM 185i  Potassium  Hydrogen  Phthalate (KHC8H4O4)  was  prepared  to  ensure  high 
purity and uniformity.  However, this SRM is certified ONLY as a pH standard [pH(S)] not as a pure substance.  
A unit of SRM 185i consists of 60 g of potassium hydrogen phthalate.

4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Description of First Aid Measures:  

Inhalation:    If  adverse  effects  occur,  remove  to  uncontaminated  area.    If  not  breathing,  give  artificial 
respiration or oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Skin Contact:  Wash skin with soap and water for at least 15 minutes.  If necessary, seek medical attention. 

Eye Contact:  Flush eyes with water for at least 15 minutes.  If necessary, seek medical attention. 

Ingestion:  Contact local poison control center or physician immediately.  Never make an unconscious person 
vomit or drink fluids.  When vomiting occurs, keep head lower than hips to help prevent aspiration.  If person is 
unconscious, turn head to side. Get medical attention. 

Most  Important  Symptoms/Effects,  Acute  and  Delayed:    No  data  available;  generated  dust  may  result  in 
irritation. 

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above 
symptoms are present, seek medical attention if needed. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Avoid generating dust; sufficient concentrations of fine dust dispersed in air, and in 
the  presence  of  an  ignition  source  is  a  potential  hazard.    See  Section 9,  “Physical  and  Chemical  Properties”  for 
flammability properties. 

Extinguishing Media: 
 
 

Suitable:  Regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide, water, regular foam. 
Unsuitable:  None listed. 

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  None listed. 

Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion 
byproducts.  Wear full protective clothing and NIOSH approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA).  Move 
container from fire area if it can be done without risk.  Stay upwind and keep out of low areas. 

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe) 

 

Health = 2 

Fire = 1 

Reactivity = 0 

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Keep unnecessary personnel away.  
Use suitable protective equipment; see Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”. 

Methods  and  Materials  for  Containment  and  Clean  up:    Notify  safety  personnel  of  spills.    Collect  spilled 
material in appropriate container for disposal.  Isolate hazard area and deny entry. 

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Safe Handling Precautions:  Avoid generating dust.  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”. 

Storage:    Store  and  handling  in  accordance  with  all  current  regulations  and  standards.    Keep  separated  from 
incompatible substances. 

8.  EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

Exposure Limits:  No occupational exposure limits have been established for this material.  The exposure limits for 
Particulates Not Otherwise Regulated are applicable. 

OSHA (PEL):  15 mg/m3 (TWA, total particulates) 
 

5 mg/m3 (TWA, respirable particulates) 

Engineering Controls:   Provide  local  exhaust  or  process  enclosure  ventilation  system.  Ensure  compliance  with 
applicable exposure limits. 

Personal Protection:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal Protective 
Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material.

Respiratory Protection:    If workplace conditions warrant a respirator, a respiratory protection program that meets 
OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.   Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators. 

Eye/Face  Protection:    Wear  splash  resistant  safety  goggles  with  a  face  shield.    An  eyewash  station  should  be 
readily available near areas of use. 

Skin  and  Body  Protection:    Personal  protective  equipment  for  the  body  should  be  selected  based  on  the  task 
being  performed  and  the  risks  involved  and  should  be  approved  by  a  specialist  before  handling  this  product.  
Chemical-resistant gloves should be worn at all times when handling chemicals.
