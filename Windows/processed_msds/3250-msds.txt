SRM Name:   
Other Means of Identification:  Not applicable. 

3250 
Saw Palmetto (Serenoa repens) Fruit 

Recommended Use of This Material and Restrictions of Use 

This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended primarily for use in validating analytical methods for the 
determination of phytosterols and fatty acids in the fruit of saw palmetto (Serenoa repens) and similar matrices.  
This SRM can also be used for quality assurance when assigning values to in-house control materials.  A unit of 
SRM 3250 consists of five packets, each containing approximately 6 g of ground saw palmetto fruit.

4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Description of First Aid Measures  

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to well-ventilated (uncontaminated) area.  If breathing is difficult, 
qualified personnel may administer oxygen.  If not breathing, qualified personnel should give artificial respiration.  
Seek immediate medical attention.  
Skin Contact:  Rinse affected skin thoroughly with soap or mild detergent and water for at least 15 minutes.   If 
skin irritation persists, seek medical aid and bring the container or label. 
Eye Contact:  Immediately flush eyes, including under the eyelids, with copious amounts of water for at least 
15 minutes.  Seek immediate medical attention. 
Ingestion:  If a large amount is swallowed, seek medical attention. 

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  No information available. 

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above 
symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Suitable:  Regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide, water, or regular foam. 
Unsuitable:  None listed. 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Slight fire hazard; sufficient concentrations of dust/air mixtures might ignite or explode 
if in the presence of an ignition source. 
Extinguishing Media 
 
 
Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  Not applicable. 
Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Move container from fire area if it can be done 
without personal risk.  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion by-products.  Wear full protective clothing and 
NIOSH-approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe) 
 

Reactivity = 0 

Health = 0 

Fire = 0 

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Use suitable protective equipment; 
see Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”. 
Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Avoid generating and accumulating dust.  Collect in 
appropriate container for disposal.  

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Safe Handling Precautions:  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”. 
Storage and Incompatible Materials:  Keep separated from incompatible substances and ignition sources. 

8.  EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

Exposure Limits:  No occupational exposure limits established for this material.  OSHA lists the following exposure 
limits for Particulates Not Otherwise Regulated. 

OSHA (PEL):  15 mg/m3 TWA (total particulates) 
 

5 mg/m3 TWA (respirable particulates) 

Engineering Controls:   Provide  local  exhaust  or  process  enclosure  ventilation  system.  Ensure  compliance  with 
applicable exposure limits. 
Personal Protection Measures:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal 
Protective Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material. 

Respiratory  Protection:    If workplace conditions warrant a  respirator, a  respiratory protection program that 
meets OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.   Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators. 

Eye Protection:  Splash resistant safety goggles and emergency eyewash are recommended. 

Skin and Body Protection:  Chemical resistant clothing and gloves are recommended.
