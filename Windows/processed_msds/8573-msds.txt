4. FIRST AID MEASURES

Description of First Aid Measures: 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration or oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention.

Skin Contact:  Wash skin with soap and water for at least 15 minutes.  Thoroughly clean and dry contaminated clothing before reuse.

Eye Contact:  Flush eyes with water for at least 15 minutes.  If necessary, seek medical attention.

Ingestion:  If a large amount is swallowed, get medical attention.

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  May irritate the eyes and skin.

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above symptoms are present, seek medical attention if needed.

5. FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Slight fire hazard.  Sufficient concentrations of dust/air mixtures may ignite or explode.  See Section 9, “Physical and Chemical Properties” for flammability properties.

Extinguishing Media:

		Suitable:  Regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide, water, regular foam.

		Unsuitable:  None listed.

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  None listed.

Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion byproducts.  Wear full protective clothing and NIOSH approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA).

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe)	

				Health = 0	Fire = 0	Reactivity = 0

6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Use suitable protective equipment; see Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.

Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Avoid generating and accumulating dust.  Collect spilled material in appropriate container for disposal.

7. HANDLING AND STORAGE

Safe Handling Precautions:  Minimize dust generation.  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.

Storage:  Store and handling in accordance with all current regulations and standards.  Keep separated from incompatible substances (See Section 10, “Stability and Reactivity”).

8. EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION

Exposure Limits:  No occupational exposure limits established for glutamic acid.  OSHA lists the following exposure limits for Particles Not Otherwise Regulated.   

		OSHA (PEL):	15 mg/m3 TWA (total particulates)

			5 mg/m3 TWA (respirable particulates)

Engineering Controls:  Provide local exhaust or process enclosure ventilation system.  Ensure compliance with applicable exposure limits.

Personal Protection:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material.

Respiratory Protection:  If workplace conditions warrant a respirator, a respiratory protection program that meets OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.  Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators.

Eye/Face Protection:  Wear splash resistant safety goggles with a face shield.  An eye wash station should be readily available near areas of use.

Skin and Body Protection:  Personal protective equipment for the body should be selected based on the task being performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a specialist before handling this product.  Chemical-resistant gloves should be worn at all times when handling chemicals.
