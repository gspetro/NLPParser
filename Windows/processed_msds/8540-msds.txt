Under the U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.1200, 
this Standard Reference Material (SRM) is NOT classified as a physical hazard or a health hazard, a simple asphyxiant,

health risk to employees.  
 
Description:  This RM is intended for use in developing and validating methods for measuring relative differences in 
carbon (C) isotope-number ratios R(13C/12C), and hydrogen (H) isotope-number ratios, R(2H/1H).  A unit of RM 8540 
consists of a 3.5 g, 5 cm × 5 cm sheet of polyethylene foil.
