Warning:    THIS  MATERIAL  SHOULD  ONLY  BE  USED  BY  PERSONS  QUALIFIED  TO  HANDLE 
RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL!   

This product contains licensed radioactive material and is therefore subject to the requirements of 10 CFR Part 20 
(e.g., public and occupational exposure limits, waste disposal).  At a minimum, the basic radiation safety principles 
of  time,  distance,  and  shielding,  and  appropriate  radiation  contamination  control  should  be  practiced  to 
avoid/minimize any external and/or internal exposure.  Consult with your Radiation Safety office for your facility’s 
radiation safety requirements/precautions specific to the radionuclide(s) (including its activity and chemical/physical 
form) in this Radioactive SRM. 

SRM 4404L is a radioactive material, Thallium-201, with a total activity of approximately 50 MBq in a nitric 
acid solution. Thallium-201 decays by electron capture.  During the decay process, X-rays and gamma rays 
with  energies  from  2 keV  to  167 keV  are  emitted.    THIS  SRM  SHOULD  ONLY  BE  USED  BY  PERSONS 
QUALIFIED TO HANDLE RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL! 

Physical Hazard: There are no known physical hazards associated with this material.
