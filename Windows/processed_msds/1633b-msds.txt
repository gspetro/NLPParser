Description:  This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended for use in the evaluation of analytical methods 
for  the  determination  of  constituent  elements  in  coal  fly  ash  or  materials  with  a  similar  matrix.    SRM 1633b  is  a 
bituminous coal fly ash that was sieved through a nominal sieve opening of 90 µm (170 mesh) and then blended to 
assure homogeneity.  A unit of SRM 1633b consists of 75 g of powdered material. 

Other Designations:  Coal Powder (bituminous coal; ground bituminous coal). 

Substance:  Coal Powder

NOTE:    The  material’s  maximum  particle  size  is  below  the  inhalation  size  limits  (100 µm  or  100 microns, 
inhalation)  established  by  the  ACGIH,  Appendix D.    The  concentrations  listed  above  apply  to  this  SRM.    This 
material  contains  various  other  elements  (see  Certificate  of  Analysis),  which  have  been  reported  to  have  toxic, 
mutagenic,  and/or  carcinogenic  properties,  and  should  be  handled  with  care.    The  concentration  of  the  ones  not 
listed above are below the reportable limit:  hazardous components (1 %); carcinogens (0.1 %), required by OSHA, 
29 CFR 1910.1200 (g)(2)(i)(C)(1), for MSDS information. 

EC Classification:  Quartz is not classified; Coal fly ash is not classified.

4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

EC Risk/Safety Phrases:  See Section 15, “Regulatory Information”. 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area. If not breathing, give artificial respiration by 
qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Skin  Contact:    Rinse  affected  area  with  soap  and  water  for  at  least  15 minutes.    Seek  medical  assistance  if 
necessary. 

Eye  Contact:    Immediately  flush  eyes,  including  under  the  eyelids,  with  copious  amounts  of  water  for  at  least 
15 minutes.  Seek immediate medical attention.  

Ingestion:  If a large amount is swallowed, seek medical attention. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Slight fire hazard.  Dust/air mixtures may ignite or explode. 

Extinguishing Media:  Regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide, water, regular foam.
