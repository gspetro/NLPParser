4.  First Aid Measures

Description of First Aid Measures 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to wellventilated (uncontaminated) area.  If not breathing, qualified personnel should give artificial respiration.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Skin Contact:  Rinse affected skin with water for at least 15 minutes, then wash thoroughly with soap or mild detergent and water.  If skin irritation persists, seek medical aid and bring the container or label.

Eye Contact:  Immediately flush eyes, including under the eyelids, with copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes.  

Ingestion:  If a large amount is swallowed, get medical attention.

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  Gastroenteritis, muscle twitching, numbness and tingling around the mouth and neck, hemoglobin in the urine, cardiac arrest.

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention.

5.  Fire Fighting Measures

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Slight fire hazard.  Dust/air mixtures may ignite or explode.  See Section 9, “Physical and Chemical Properties” for flammability properties.

Extinguishing Media

	Suitable:  Regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide, water.

	Unsuitable:  None listed.

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  Not applicable.

Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for FireFighters:  Move container from fire area if it can be done without personal risk.  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion byproducts.  Wear full protective clothing and NIOSHapproved selfcontained breathing apparatus (SCBA).

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe)

				Health = 2	Fire = 1	Reactivity = 0

6.  Accidental Release Measures

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Use suitable protective equipment; see Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.  Keep out of waters supplies and sewers.

Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Collect in appropriate container for disposal. 

7.  Handling and Storage

Safe Handling Precautions:  Avoid dust formation.  Avoid breathing dust.  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.

Storage and Incompatible Materials:  Store in a wellventilated area.  Keep separated from incompatible substances (see Section 10, “Stability and Reactivity”).



8. Exposure Controls and Personal Protection

Exposure Limits

			OSHA (PEL):	0.5 mg/m3 TWA – as Barium, soluble compounds (as Br)

			NIOSH (REL):	0.5 mg/m3 TWA – as Barium, soluble compounds (as Br)

Engineering Controls:  Provide local exhaust or process enclosure ventilation system.  Ensure compliance with applicable exposure limits.

Personal Protection Measures:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material.

Respiratory Protection:  If workplace conditions warrant a respirator, a respiratory protection program that meets OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.  Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators.

Eye Protection:  Splash resistant safety goggles and emergency eyewash are recommended.

Skin and Body Protection:  Chemical resistant clothing and gloves are recommended.

Ingestion

Symptoms Related to the Physical, Chemical and Toxicological Characteristics:  Gastroenteritis, muscle twitching, numbness and tingling around the mouth and neck, hemoglobin in the urine, cardiac arrest. 

Potential Health Effects (Acute, Chronic, and Delayed)

	Inhalation:  There is no data listed for acute exposure.  Long term (chronic) or repeated exposure to insoluble barium compounds has resulted in baritosis, a benign form of pneumoconiosis.

Skin Contact:  Contact with powder may cause mechanical irritation.

Eye Contact:  Contact with powder may cause mechanical irritation.

Ingestion:  Ingestion of this material is unlikely under normal conditions of use.  The toxicity of barium compounds is dependent on their solubility.  Insoluble barium compounds are generally nontoxic.  Ingestion of soluble barium compounds may result in acute gastroenteritis, disturbances in cardiac action, muscle twitching, central nervous system stimulation and depression, kidney damage, and death.  Ingestion of 1 g of barium ion (Ba+2) from soluble barium compounds may be fatal.  No data is listed for chronic exposure.
