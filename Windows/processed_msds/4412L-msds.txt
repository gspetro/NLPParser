Warning:    THIS  MATERIAL  SHOULD  ONLY  BE  USED  BY  PERSONS  QUALIFIED  TO  HANDLE 
RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL!   

This product contains licensed radioactive material and is therefore subject to the requirements of 10 CFR Part 20 
(e.g., public and occupational exposure limits, waste disposal).  At a minimum, the basic radiation safety principles 
of  time,  distance,  and  shielding,  and  appropriate  radiation  contamination  control  should  be  practiced  to 
avoid/minimize any external and/or internal exposure.  Consult with your Radiation Safety office for your facility’s 
radiation safety requirements/precautions specific to the radionuclide(s) (including its activity and chemical/physical 
form) in this Radioactive SRM. 

SRM 4412L is a radioactive material, Molybdenum-99, with a massic activity of approximately 28 MBq•g ‐1 in 
nitric acid solution.  Molybdenum-99 decays by beta-particle emission to excited levels of Tc-99. During the 
decay process, X-rays and gamma rays with energies from 2 keV to 762 keV are also emitted. 

Physical Hazard: There are no known physical hazards associated with this material.

Symptoms  Related  to  the  Physical,  Chemical  and  Toxicological  Characteristics:    Burning  pain  and  severe 
corrosive skin damage.  Permanent eye damage including blindness could result. 

Potential Health Effects (Acute, Chronic and Delayed): 

Inhalation:  Nitric acid, if inhaled, can damage the mucous membranes and respiratory tract.  Short term exposure 
may cause irritation and inflammation of the upper respiratory tract, coughing, choking, sore throat, shortness of 
breath, headache, dizziness, and nausea.  Long term exposure to acid fumes may cause damage to teeth, bronchial 
irritation, chronic cough, bronchial pneumonia, and gastrointestinal disturbances.   

Skin Contact:  Nitric acid can cause severe skin burns.  Severity of the damage depends on the concentration and 
duration of exposure.  Effects of acid burns may be delayed. 

Eye Contact:  Nitric acid can cause severe eye irritation, corneal burns, permanent eye damage, or blindness.  
Severity of the damage depends on the concentration and duration of exposure. 

Ingestion:  Ingestion of this material is unlikely under normal conditions of use.  If ingested, nitric acid can cause 
severe burns and damage to the gastrointestinal tract. 

Skin Corrosion/Irritation:  This SRM contains 18 % nitric acid and it is classified as Category 1B.
