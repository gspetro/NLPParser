2269 
Perdeuterated PAH-I Solution in Hexane/Toluene 

Recommended Use of This Material and Restrictions of Use 

This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  use  as  an  internal  standard,  or  surrogate 
internal standard, solution that is used to spike both the unknown sample and the calibration or external standard 
solution  of  non-labeled  PAHs.    A  unit  of  SRM 2269  consists  of  five  2 mL  ampoules,  each  containing 
approximately  1.2 mL  of  a  solution  of  five  perdeuterated  polycyclic  aromatic  hydrocarbons (PAHs)  in

4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Description of First Aid Measures: 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration 
or oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Skin Contact:  Wash skin with soap and water for at least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing and 
shoes.  Get immediate medical attention.  Thoroughly clean and dry contaminated clothing before reuse. Destroy 
contaminated shoes. 

Eye Contact:  Immediately flush eyes, including under the eyelids with copious amounts of water for at least 
15 minutes.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Ingestion:  Aspiration hazard!  Do not induce vomiting.  If vomiting occurs, keep head lower than hips to help 
prevent aspiration.  Get immediate medical attention.  Give artificial respiration if not breathing. 

SRM 2269 

 

Page 2 of 7 

Most  Important  Symptoms/Effects,  Acute  and  Delayed:    Respiratory  tract,  skin,  and  eye  irritation;  aspiration 
hazard, nervous system depression, and nerve damage. 

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above 
symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Severe fire hazard.  The vapor is heavier than air.  Vapors or gases may ignite at distant 
ignition sources and flash back.  Vapor/air mixtures are explosive.  Electrostatic discharges may be generated by flow 
or agitation resulting in ignition or explosion.  See Section 9, “Physical and Chemical Properties” for flammability 
properties. 

Extinguishing Media: 
 
 

Suitable:  Regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide, water, regular foam. 
Unsuitable:  None listed. 

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  Thermal decomposition products: oxides of carbon, hydrocarbons. 

Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion 
byproducts.  Wear full protective clothing and NIOSH approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe)  
 

Reactivity = 0 

Health = 2 

Fire = 3 

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Avoid heat, flames, sparks and other 
sources of ignition.  Stop leak if possible without personal risk.  Immediately contact emergency personnel, Isolate 
hazard area, and deny entry.  Reduce vapors with water spray.  Use suitable protective equipment; see Section 8, 
“Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”. 

Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Do not touch spilled material.  Notify safety personnel 
of spills.  Absorb with sand or other non-combustible material.  Collect spilled material in appropriate container for 
disposal.  Avoid and remove sources of ignition.  Keep out of water supplies and sewers. 

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Safe  Handling  Precautions:    Open  glass  ampoules  carefully  to  prevent  contamination  and  injury.    See  Section 8, 
“Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”. 

Storage:  Sealed ampoules, as received, should be stored in the dark at temperatures lower than 30 °C.  Store and 
handle in accordance with all current regulations and standards.  Keep separated from incompatible substances (See 
Section 10, “Stability and Reactivity”).

Respiratory  Protection:    If workplace conditions warrant a  respirator, a  respiratory protection program that 
meets OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.   Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators. 

Eye/Face Protection:  Wear splash resistant safety goggles with a face shield.  An eyewash station should be 
readily available near areas of use. 

Skin and Body Protection:  Personal protective equipment for the body should be selected based on the task 
being performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a specialist before handling this product.
