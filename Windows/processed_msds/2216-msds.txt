Miniaturized Low-Energy Charpy V-Notch KLST Impact Specimens (Self-Verification) 

Under the U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.1200, 
this Standard Reference Material (SRM) is NOT classified as a physical hazard or a health hazard, a simple asphyxiant, 
combustible  dust,  pyrophoric  gas,  or  hazard  not  otherwise  classified.    There  are  no  hazard  pictograms,  hazard 
statements or signal word associated with it.  Safety Data Sheet information is not required.  This document may be 
used in conjunction with your hazard communication program. 
 
Exemption:    1910.1200 (c).    This  SRM  is  an  Article,  as  the  word  is  defined  by  OSHA,  where  Article  means  a 
manufactured item other than a fluid or particle: (i) which is formed to a specific shape or design during manufacture; 
(ii) which has end use function(s) dependent in whole or in part upon its shape or design during end use; and (iii) which 
under normal conditions of use does not release more than very small quantities, e.g., minute or trace amounts of a 
hazardous chemical (as determined under paragraph (d) of 1910.1200), and does not pose a physical hazard or health 
risk to employees. 
 
Description:    This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  intended  for  the  verification  of  maximum  force  and 
absorbed energy values measured at room temperature using a small-scale Charpy machine in accordance with the 
current ASTM Standard E2248 or the current ISO Standard 14556.  A unit of SRM 2216 consists of a set of three 
KLST-type miniaturized Charpy specimens needed to perform a single verification.  SRM 2216 can be used to verify 
the absorbed energy scale of a small-scale impact machine at the low-energy level (approximately 1.6 J). 
 
Disposal:  SRM 2216 should be disposed of in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations. 
 
Transport  Information:    This  material  is  not  regulated  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  Transportation (DOT)  and/or 
International Air Transport Association (IATA).
