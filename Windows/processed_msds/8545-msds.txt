disposal. 

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Safe Handling Precautions:  Minimize dust generation.  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”. 

Storage:    Store  and  handle  in  accordance  with  all  current  regulations  and  standards.    Keep  separated  from 
incompatible substances (see Section 10 “Stability and Reactivity”). 

8.  EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

Exposure Limits:  No occupational exposure limits have been established.  The exposure limits for Particulates Not 
Otherwise Regulated are applicable. 

OSHA (PEL):  15 mg/m3 (TWA, total particulates) 

  5 mg/m3 (TWA, respirable particulates)

Engineering Controls:   Provide  local  exhaust  or  process  enclosure  ventilation  system.  Ensure  compliance  with 
applicable exposure limits. 

Personal Protection:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal Protective 
Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material. 

Respiratory Protection:    If workplace conditions warrant a respirator, a respiratory protection program that 
meets  OSHA  29CFR  1910.134  must  be  followed.    Refer  to  NIOSH  42  CFR  84  for  applicable  certified 
respirators. 

Eye/Face Protection:  Wear splash resistant safety goggles with a face shield.  An eye wash station should be 
readily available near areas of use. 

Skin and Body Protection:  Personal protective equipment for the body should be selected based on the task 
being performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a specialist before handling this product.  
Chemical-resistant gloves should be worn at all times when handling chemicals.

Skin 

X 

Ingestion 

Symptoms Related to the Physical, Chemical and Toxicological Characteristics:  Gastrointestinal upset, irregular 
or slow heartbeat, neurological affects, eye irritation. 

Potential Health Effects (Acute, Chronic and Delayed): 

Inhalation:    Acute  exposure  to  dusts  may  cause  coughing,  sore  throat  and  irritation.    No  data  available  for 
chronic inhalation. 

Skin  Contact:    Acute  exposure  of  to  the  skin  may  cause  mild  irritation  and  redness.    No  data  available  for 
chronic exposure. 

Eye Contact:  Acute exposure may cause irritation, with redness and pain.  Repeated and prolonged exposure 
to irritants in general may cause conjunctivitis. 

Ingestion: 
Acute exposure: Ingestion of large amounts may cause severe gastroenteritis, affect the central nervous system, 
renal function and  fluid  electrolyte  balance,  and  cardiac  function.   Major  symptoms,  some  of which may  be 
delayed, include: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, blurred vision, drowsiness, tremor, bradycardia (slow heartbeat), 
renal failure and coma.  Overdose survivors have suffered permanent neurological effects such as Parkinsonism. 

Chronic  exposure:  Repeated  ingestion  of  large  doses  may  result  in  symptoms  similar  to  those  listed  under 
“acute  exposure”,  as  well  as  changes  in  vision  (including  blindness),  cardiac  arrhythmias,  leukocytosis, 
hyperthyroidism, transitory nephrotic syndrome, and osteoporosis.  Studies of women who have been treated 
medically with lithium carbonate have shown that lithium readily crosses the placental barrier during pregnancy, 
and is excreted in breast milk.
