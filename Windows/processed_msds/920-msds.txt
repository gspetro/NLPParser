4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Description of First Aid Measures  

Inhalation:    If  adverse  effects  occur,  remove  to  uncontaminated  area.    Give  artificial  respiration  if  not 
breathing.  Get immediate medical attention. 

Skin Contact:  Wash skin with soap and water for at least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing 
and shoes.  Get medical attention, if needed.  Thoroughly clean and dry contaminated clothing and shoes before 
reuse. 

Eye Contact:  Flush eyes with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes. Then get immediate medical attention. 

Ingestion:  If a large amount is swallowed, get medical attention. 

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  May cause mild or mechanical eye, skin, or respiratory 
tract irritation. 

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above 
symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention. 

5.  Fire Fighting Measures 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Slight fire hazard.  Avoid generating dust; sufficient concentrations of  fine dust 
dispersed  in  air,  and  in  the  presence  of  an  ignition  source  is  a  potential  hazard.    See  Section  9,  “Physical  and 
Chemical Properties” for flammability properties. 

Extinguishing Media 
 
 

Suitable:  Regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide, water, or alcohol-resistant foam. 
Unsuitable:  None listed. 

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  Not applicable. 

Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for  Fire-Fighters:  Move container from fire area if it can be 
done without personal risk.  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion by-products.  Wear full protective clothing 
and NIOSH-approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe) 
 

Reactivity = 0 

Health = 1 

Fire = 1 

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Personal  Precautions,  Protective  Equipment  and  Emergency  Procedures:    Any  accumulated  material  on 
surfaces should be removed and properly disposed of.  Use suitable protective equipment; see Section 8, “Exposure 
Controls and Personal Protection”.  Keep out of waters supplies and sewers. 

Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Collect in appropriate container for disposal.  

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Safe Handling Precautions:  Minimize dust generation and accumulation on surfaces.  See Section 8, “Exposure 
Controls and Personal Protection”. 

Storage and Incompatible Materials:  Store and handling in accordance with all current regulations and standards.  
Keep separated from incompatible substances (see Section 10, “Stability and Reactivity”). 

8. EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

Exposure Limits:  This material is a particulate matter and adequate inhalation/respiratory protection should be 
used to minimize exposure.  No occupational exposure limits have been established for D-Mannitol.  The exposure 
limits for Particulates Not Otherwise Regulated are applicable. 

Particulates Not Otherwise Regulated (PNOR) 

OSHA (PEL):  15 mg/m3 (TWA, total dust) 
 

5 mg/m3 (TWA, respirable fraction) 

NIOSH (REL):  15 mg/m3 (TWA, total dust) 
 

5 mg/m3 (TWA, respirable fraction)

Engineering Controls:  Provide local exhaust or process enclosure ventilation system.  Ensure compliance with 
applicable exposure limits. 

Personal Protection Measures:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal 
Protective Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material. 

Respiratory Protection:  If workplace conditions warrant a respirator, a respiratory protection program that 
meets  OSHA 29CFR 1910.134  must  be  followed.    Refer  to  NIOSH  42 CFR 84  for  applicable  certified 
respirators. 

Eye Protection:  Splash resistant safety goggles and emergency eyewash are recommended. 

Skin and Body Protection:  Chemical resistant clothing and gloves are recommended.
