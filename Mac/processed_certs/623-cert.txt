These  Standard  Reference  Materials  are  certified  and  designed  to  check  test  methods  and  to  cali- 
brate  equipment  for  the  determination  of  the  Resistance  of  Glass  Containers  to  Chemical  Attack.

These  values  represent  the  volume  of  fiftieth-normal  sulfuric  acid  used  to  titrate  to  the  methyl-red 
end  point  the  alkaline  extract  from  a  crushed  sample  of  glass  after  exposure  to  high-purity  water 
[1]  at  121°C  (ASTM  C225-73,  Method  P-W,with  MortarCrushing  option  [2]).  This  method  of  test  is 
also  speciiied in  the  U.S.  Pharmacopeia  [3]  and in  the  National  Formulary  [  4]. 

The  indicated  uncertainties  are  the  95  percent  tolerance  limits  for  coverage  of  95  percent  of 
measured  values  of  these  lots  of  glass  samples.  An  example  of  the  use  of  the  statistical  tolerance 
limit  is  given  in  NBS  Monograph  148  (pp.  13-14).  In  brief,  if  all  the  samples  were  measured,  95 
percent  of  the  measured  values  would  fall  within  the  indicated  tolerance  limits  95%  of  the  time. 

The  technical  and  support  aspects  involved  in  the  preparation,  certification,  and  issuance  of  these 
Standard  Reference  Materials  were  coordinated  through  the  Office  of  Standard  Reference  Materials 
by  R.  E.  Michaelis  and  C.  L.  Stanley.

Materials  are 

issued  as  cullet  weighing  about  2.2  kg  each.  The  materials 
These 
were  prepared  and  furnished  to  NBS  by  Corning  Glass  Works,  Corning,  New  York,  and  Owens- 
Illinois,  Inc.,  Toledo,  Ohio.  Direction  and  coordination  of  the  ASTM  interlab  comparison  was  given 
by  Frank  Bacon,  Chairman,  ASTM  Subcommittee  C-14.03  on  Chemical  Properties  of  Glass.  The 
laboratories  that  cooperated  in  these  measurements  are: 

Brockway  Glass  Co.,  Brockway,  Pennsylvania 
Corning  Glass  Works,  Corning,  New  York 
Eli  Lilly  Co.,  Indianapolis,  Indiana 
Emhart  Corp.,  Hartford,  Connecticut 
Johns-Manville,  Toledo,  Ohio 

‘National  Bureau  of  Standards,  Washington,  D.C. 
Owens-Illinois,  Inc.,  Kimble  Division,  Vineland,  New  Jersey

Statistical  analysis  of  the  data  leading  to  certification  was  performed  by  H.  H.  Ku,  National  Bureau 
of  Standards.
