neat 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is certified as a neat chemical material of known purity.  It is intended to be 
Oo 
used as a primary measurement standard  for calibration of clinical measurement laboratory  procedures to determine 
quantities of creatinine.  A unit of SRM 914b consists of 10 g of high-purity crystalline creatinine.

A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its a
suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account
creatinine (expressed as per cent) [2] and t he uncertainty is expressed as the 95  % confidence interval ( U95%) [3,4].  
Metrological traceability of the certified value is to the SI throug
specific amount of substance (mol/g) and mass fraction (%).  The certified value was determined using a quantitative 
1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-qNMR) primary ratio measurement procedure [5,6].

Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 914b is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until 31 May 2028, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given in this certificate 
(see “Instructions for Storage and Use”)
.  The certification is nullified if the SRM is da maged, contaminated, or 
otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical changes occur that affect the certification, NIST will notify the purch aser.  Registration (see attached sheet 
or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Overall direction and coordination of the technical activities were under the chairmanship of M.A. Nelson of the NIST 
Chemical Sciences Division. 
 
Analytical measurements at NIST were performed by M.A.

Statistical analysis was provided by B. Toman of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division.  
 
Support aspects involved in the issuance of this SRM were coordinated through the N

INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE AND USE 
 
Storage:  The SRM should be stored in its original container, tightly closed and pr otected from moisture, heat, 
and direct light.     Refrigeration is recommended (4  °C) for long term storage, though the material should be 
brought to room temperature (between 20  °C and  30 °C) before opening the container for each use.   It should 
not be exposed to temperatures greater than 30 °C. 
 
Use:  SRM 914b stored as described above, should be used without preliminary drying.  The minimum sample size is 
5 mg. 
 
SOURCE AND ANALYSIS 
 
a  commercial  supplier 
Source of Material:  The SRM source material was obtained from a commercial supplier. 
 
Analytical Approach and  Heterogeneity assessment :   Analyses for chemical   identity,  purity,  and  heterogeneity 
were performed by NIST using  twenty-two units, selected  at regular intervals across the entire production lot
.  A 
1H-qNMR  primary ratio measurement   procedure  using an internal standard approach was implemented for the 
determination of creatinine mass fraction with metrological traceability to SI units.  Calculation of the 95 % coverage 
1H-qNMR 
interval was performed under the Bayesian paradigm using a hierar
procedure [7,8].  No trend in mass fraction  of creatinine  was observed with respect to filling order and there is no 
significant heterogeneity at the 95 % confidence level.   Methanol impurity content was approximated via 1H-qNMR 
as 0.004 %.  Supporting and confirmatory measurements for assessment of impurity components were made via liquid 
ultraviolet d etection (LC-UV)  and liquid chromatography with 
chromatography with 
detection (LC-MS).  While no significant amount of  structurally-related organic chemical impurity was  determined 
with respect to the 95 % confidence interval, an insignificant relative amount of creatine was identified as an impurity 
via LC-MS.
