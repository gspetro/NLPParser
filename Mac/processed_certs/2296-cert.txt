Certificate of Analysis 
Standard Reference Material 2296 

 

 
Reformulated Gasoline (13 % ETBE) 

 
This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  use  in  the  calibration  of  instruments  and  the 
evaluation of methods used for the determination of total sulfur, benzene, toluene, and ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE) 
in  reformulated  gasoline  or  similar  matrices.    A  unit  of  SRM 2296  consists  of  a  set  of  two  20 mL  ampoules 
containing a synthetic gasoline blend of 25 organic compounds. 
 
Certified  Mass  Fraction  Values:    Certified  mass  fraction  values  and  associated  95 %  confidence  intervals  are 
given in Table 1.  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that 
all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [1]. 
 
Reference  Mass  Fraction  Values:    Reference  mass  fraction  values  and  associated  95 %  confidence  intervals  are 
given in Table 2.  A NIST reference value is a noncertified value that is an estimate of the true value.  However, the 
value does not meet the NIST criteria for certification and is provided with an associated uncertainty that may reflect 
only measurement precision, may not include all sources of uncertainty, or may reflect a lack of sufficient statistical 
agreement among multiple analytical methods [1]. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 2296 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until 31 December 2022, provided that the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given in 
this  certificate.  (See  “Instructions  for  Storage  and  Use.”)    However,  the  certification  is  nullified  if  the  SRM  is 
damaged, contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance  of  SRM  Certification:    NIST  will  monitor  this  SRM  over  the  period  of  its  certification.    If 
substantive  technical  changes  occur  that affect  the  certification before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST will 
notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification.  
 
The  overall  direction  and  coordination  of  technical  measurements  leading  to  certification  were  performed  by 
G.W. Kramer and F.R. Guenther of the NIST Analytical Chemistry Division. 
 
Analytical  measurements 
this  SRM  were  performed  by  S.N. Chesler, 
S.J. Choquette, F.R. Guenther, T.L. Green, W.R. Kelly, J.L. Mann, S.A. Margolis, L.C. Sander, and R.D. Vocke, Jr. 
of the NIST Analytical Chemistry Division.  Data analysis was performed by D.L. Duewer of the NIST Analytical 
Chemistry Division.  
 
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Measurement  Services 
Division.

NOTICE AND WARNING TO USERS 
 
Consult the Material Safety Data Sheet for details on safe handling before use.  Ensure local exhaust or adequate 
ventilation in storage and laboratory facilities meet published gasoline exposure limits.  Prevent contact with heat, 
sparks, or open flame.  Those handling gasoline should wear appropriate clothing and gloves to prevent skin contact 
with this material and appropriate safety goggles to prevent eye contact. 
 
Protect ampoules from physical damage.  The unscored, thick-walled ampoules of this SRM must be opened with 
care and attention.  Score the ampoule completely around the neck with a sharp triangular file or other scoring tool.  
Wrap the body of the ampoule in a thick cotton towel or use leather gloves while snapping the neck from the body 
of the ampoule. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE AND USE 
 
Storage:  Sealed ampoules, as received, should be stored in the dark at temperatures between 10 °C to 30 °C away 
from incompatible materials (see “Notice and Warning to Users”).  Ampoules should be opened as described above. 
 
Use:    Aliquots  for  analysis  (minimum  sample  size  of  1 g)  should  be  withdrawn  at  20 °C  to  25 °C  and  used 
immediately  after  opening  the  ampoules.   Samples  must  be  processed without delay  for  the  certified  values  to  be 
valid within the stated confidence intervals. 
 
SOURCE AND PREPARATION 
 
This  SRM  was  prepared  by  Spectrum  Quality  Standards,  Inc.  at  their  facilities  in  Houston,  TX(1).    All  chemicals 
used in the preparation of this material were obtained from commercial sources.  The synthetic gasoline base was 
prepared from twenty-one reagent-grade saturate, olefinic, and aromatic stock materials.  A typical gas chromatogram 
of the reformulated gasoline base is shown in Figure 1.  Three reagent-grade thionate stock materials were mixed with 
HPLC-grade ETBE.  Known masses of synthetic gasoline base, thionate/ETBE mixture, and ETBE were combined, 
mixed, and chilled in a pressurized vessel.  The solution was dispensed into 20 mL glass ampoules; the ampoules 
were cooled to –30 °C and flame sealed. 
 
Homogeneity Assessment:  The homogeneity of SRM 2296 was assessed at NIST at a 1 g sample size. 
 
Value Assignment:  The mass fraction (mass constituent/total mass) of sulfur is based on isotope-dilution thermal 
ionization  mass  spectrometry [2].    The  mass  fraction  of  benzene  and  the  mass  fraction  of  ETBE  are  based  upon 
split-injection,  flame-ionization  detection  gas  chromatographic  (GC-FID)  analysis  coupled  with  gravimetry.    The 
mass fraction of toluene is based upon reverse-phase liquid chromatography, GC-FID analysis, and gravimetry.  The 
reference value of water is based on coulometric Karl Fischer titration.  The major aromatic and olefinic constituents of the 
synthetic base gasoline were determined using GC-FID after a rigorous evaluation of the purity of the constituent stock 
materials by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS).  The reference values of the organic components of this 
SRM have been deduced from the GC-FID measurements of the base gasoline composition combined with the known 
mass of the various components of the mixture.  The aromatic, olefinic, and saturate composite reference values are the 
sum of all constituents identified as belonging to each of these groupings.  The reference value of the total organic oxygen 
composite is the sum of the oxygen mass fraction of all identified organic oxygenates. 
 
The  95 %  confidence  interval  for  each  certified  and  reference  value  has  been  assigned  on  the  basis  of  analytical 
judgment [3,4].    It  incorporates  estimates  of  analytical  precision,  known  biases  among  methods  of  differing 
analytical reliability, reliability estimates for the mass-spectrometric identification of impurities, and allowance for 
apparent  heterogeneity  among  the  ampoules.    The  certified  mass  fraction  of  each  component  is  expected  to  lie 
within the specified interval with a 95 % level of confidence.  The reference values do not meet NIST criteria for 
certification and the uncertainty associated with each reference value may not include all sources of uncertainty. 
 

                                                           

(1) Certain commercial equipment, instrumentation, or materials are identified in this certificate to adequately specify the 
experimental procedure.  Such identification does not imply recommendation or endorsement by NIST, nor does it imply that the 
materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the purpose.
