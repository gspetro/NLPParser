Certificate of Analysis 
Standard Reference Material® 612 

 

 
Trace Elements in Glass 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended to facilitate development of chemical methods of analysis for 
trace  elements  in glass.   The  nominal  mass  fractions  of 61 elements  added  to the  glass  matrix  are  in the  range of 
10 mg/kg  to  80 mg/kg.    A unit  of  SRM 612  consists  of  four wafers,  sliced  to  3 mm  thickness  from  a  hand-pulled 
rod.  The wafers are of oval to circular cross-section with nominal diameter of 12 mm to 14 mm. 
 
Certified  Mass  Fraction  Values:    Certified  values  for  15 elements  of  SRM 612  are  reported  in  Table 1  as  mass 
fractions [1].  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that all 
known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [2]. 
 
Reference  Values:    Reference  values  for  four  elements  are  reported  in  Table 2  as  mass  fractions [1].    The 
normalized isotope atom ratio for strontium is also included.  Reference values are non-certified values that are the 
best  estimates  of  the  true  values  based  on  available  data;  however,  the  values  do  not  meet  the  NIST  criteria  for 
certification [2]  and  are  provided  with  associated  uncertainties  that  may  reflect  only  measurement  reproducibility, 
may not include all sources of uncertainty, or may reflect a lack of sufficient statistical agreement among multiple 
analytical methods. 
 
Information Values:  Information values for 13 elements are reported in Table 3 as mass fractions.  Also reported 
is the isotope atom fraction of uranium-235.  An information value is considered a value that will be of interest to 
the SRM user, but insufficient information is available to assess the uncertainty associated with the value [2]. 
 
Expiration  of  Certification:    The  certification  of  SRM 612  is  valid  indefinitely,  within  the  measurement 
uncertainties  specified,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  given  in  this 
certificate (see “Instructions for Handling, Storage, and Use”).  Accordingly, periodic recalibration or recertification 
of  this  SRM  is  not  required.    The  certification  is  nullified  if  the  SRM  is  damaged,  contaminated,  or  otherwise 
modified. 
 
Maintenance  of  SRM  Certification:    NIST  will  monitor  this  material  over  the  period  of  its  certification.    If 
substantive  technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification,  NIST  will  notify  the  purchaser.  Registration  (see 
attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
Coordination  of  technical  measurements  for  certification  of  SRM 612  was  performed  by  W.R. Shields  of  what  is 
now the NIST Analytical Chemistry Division.  Coordination of technical measurements for updates of values was 
performed by W.C. Davis and J.R. Sieber of the NIST Analytical Chemistry Division.   
 
Analyses for the original characterization were performed by R.W. Burke, T.E. Gills, E.J. Maienthal, L.W. Masters, 
T.C. Rains, and B.A. Thompson of what is now the NIST Analytical Chemistry Division.  Analyses for the initial 
update  of  values  were  performed  by  E.L. Garner,  J.W. Gramlich,  L.A. Machlan,  J.R. Moody,  L.J. Moore, 
T.J. Murphy, P.J. Paulsen, and K.M. Sappenfield of what is now the NIST Analytical Chemistry Division.  Analyses 
for the current update of values were performed by W.C. Davis and J.R. Sieber of the NIST Analytical Chemistry 
Division.

Analyses for the original characterization were performed by the following collaborating laboratories and analysts:  
United  States  Geological  Survey,  Denver, CO,  C. Hedge  and  M. Tatsumoto;  Australian  National  University, 
Canberra, ACT, Australia, W. Compston; and University of Ghent, Ghent, Belgium, F. Bellemans. 
 
Statistical  consultation  for  this  SRM  was  provided  by  S.D. Leigh,  A.L. Pintar,  and  A.M. Possolo  of  the  NIST 
Statistical Engineering Division. 
 
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Measurement  Services 
Division. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
To relate analytical determinations to certified values, a minimum sample quantity of 250 mg is recommended (see 
“Preparation  and  Analysis”).    Each  wafer  surface  should be  cleaned before use.    To prepare  a wafer  for  analysis, 
wipe it clean with ethanol, then give it a mild surface cleaning (not etch) in dilute (1:10) HNO3.  The acid wash is 
recommended to remove potential copper contamination from cutting with a copper-bonded diamond wheel.  The 
material should be stored in its original container in a cool, dry location.  
 
Preparation and Analysis:  Sixty-one trace elements were added to the glass support matrix, which has a nominal 
composition of 72 % SiO2, 14 % Na2O, 12 % CaO, and 2 % Al2O3 (mass fractions).  A list of 29 elements that were 
added but for which no values have been assigned is provided in Table 4.  The material was prepared in rod form 
and  then  sliced  into  wafers.    Considerable  effort  was  invested  in  the  manufacturing  of  the  material  to  ensure 
sufficient homogeneity to yield a ≤2 % relative repeatability of measurement when an entire wafer is used.  Spatial 
heterogeneity  exists  within  each  wafer,  which  may  adversely  affect  repeatability  of  microanalysis  techniques.  
Values were assigned using the analytical methods listed in Table 5. 
 
Certified Value Assignment:  For antimony, arsenic, barium, cadmium, chromium, manganese, and selenium, the 
certified value and uncertainty were determined during recertification.  Their certified values are weighted means of 
the  mass  fractions  determined  using  the  methods  listed  in  Table 5.    The  form  of  the  weights  was  introduced  in 
reference 3  and  described  further  in  reference 4.    Their  expanded  uncertainties  are  the  half  widths  of  symmetric 
95 % parametric bootstrap confidence intervals [5] with expansion factor k = 1.96, and are consistent with the ISO 
Guide [6]. 
 
The certified values for iron, lead, nickel, rubidium, silver, strontium, thorium, and uranium are as assigned in the 
original  certificate  of  this  material.    These  values  have  not  been  updated,  and  are  qualified  with  the  original 
statement of measurement uncertainty, which is equal to the entire range of values measured for individual samples 
or  to  the 95 %  confidence  interval,  whichever  is  greater.  The  user  can treat  such uncertainty  assessments  as  half 
widths  of  95 %  confidence  intervals  based  on  Gaussian,  Type A  evaluations  using  no  more  than  five  measured 
values each.

Reference Value Assignment:  Each reference value is the equally weighted mean of the results from the methods 
listed  in  Table 5.    The  reference  values  for  cobalt,  copper,  thallium,  titanium,  and  strontium  isotope  ratio  are  as 
assigned in the original certificate of this material.  These values have not been updated, and are qualified with the 
original statement of measurement uncertainty, which is equal to the entire range of values measured for individual 
samples or to the 95 % confidence interval, whichever is greater.  The user can treat such uncertainty assessments as 
half widths of 95 % confidence intervals based on Gaussian, Type A evaluations using no more than five measured 
values each.
