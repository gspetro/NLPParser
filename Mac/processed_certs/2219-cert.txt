Standard Reference Material® 2219 
 

Miniaturized Super-High-Energy Charpy V-Notch KLST Specimens 
 

(Self-Verification) 
 
Lot No.  SH-36 
 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended for the verification of maximum force and absorbed energy values 
measured  at  room  temperature  using  a  small-scale  Charpy  impact  machine  in  accordance  with  the  current  ASTM 
Standard E2248 [1] or the current ISO Standard 14556 [2]. A unit of SRM 2219 consists of a set of three KLST-type 
miniaturized Charpy specimens needed to perform a single verification. SRM 2219 can be used to verify the absorbed 
energy scale of a small-scale impact machine at the super-high-energy level (approximately 10 J). 
 
Material Description:  SRM 2219 is made from T200 maraging steel.  Each specimen has a code identifying the energy 
level (SH) and an identification number (up to three digits). 
 
SRM Certification Procedure:  Specimens taken from SRM 2219 were certified for both maximum force (Fm) and 
absorbed energy (KV) by means of an international interlaboratory comparison (round-robin) coordinated by the NIST 
Applied Chemicals and Materials Division [3].  The round-robin results were statistically evaluated in collaboration with 
the NIST Statistical Engineering Division to assure consistency among laboratories and establish certified values.  A 
NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy, in that all known or suspected 
sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [4].  The measurands are absorbed energy as measured by 
the  NIST  Charpy  reference  machines,  and  maximum  force  as  established  from  the  interlaboratory  comparison.  
Traceability is to the SI units joule (absorbed energy) and kilonewton (force).  The certified values for the SRM 2219 
specimens are given in Table 1.

(a) The uncertainties in the certified values are expressed as expanded uncertainties, U = kuc, where uc is the standard uncertainty.  The 
coverage factor, k = 2.306, is determined from Student's t-distribution corresponding to 8 degrees of freedom and a 95 % confidence 
level [4,5]. 

 
Expiration of Certification:  The certified values and uncertainties furnished in this certificate are valid indefinitely.  
The indirect verification result for the absorbed energy scale is valid for one year from the date on which the SRM was 
tested.  If a user’s machine is moved or undergoes any major repairs or adjustments, the current verification will be 
invalidated,  and  the  machine  must  be  retested  and  verified  (see  “Instructions  for  Handling,  Storage,  and  Use”).  
Currently, there are no requirements for the indirect verification of the  force scale.  However, it is recommended to 
verify the calibration of the instrumented striker of the small-scale Charpy machine every time the striker undergoes 
repairs or adjustment, or damage is suspected, and every time the impact machine is indirectly verified for absorbed 
energy.

Maintenance of SRM Certified Values:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Overall direction and coordination of the technical measurements leading to verification of test specimens and machines 
are under the direction of the NIST Applied Chemicals and Materials Division, Boulder, CO. 
 
Support aspects involved in the issuance of this SRM were coordinated through the NIST Office of Reference Materials. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
to  testing. 
Handling:  The protective oil coating should be wiped from each specimen with a lint-free cloth just prior to testing. 
 
Storage:  The SRM is anticipated to have an indefinite shelf life under normal storage conditions (20 °C ± 20 °C, ≤ 50 % 
relative humidity). 
 
Use:  Prior to verifying a small-scale Charpy V-Notch machine, the machine should be checked to assure compliance 
with the appropriate sections of the applicable ASTM or ISO standard.  SRM 2219 is tested at 21 °C ± 1 °C 
 
When using SRM 2219, the user performs a self-service verification of the test machine. The data and specimens are 
are 
not returned to NIST following the test. NIST provides no letter or certification sticker for the machine tested. 
 
The  energy  level  of  the  SRM  appropriate  for  verifying  the  performance  of  a  particular  small-scale  Charpy  impact 
machine can be determined by considering the energy  for the SRM, the  maximum capacity of the  machine, and the 
requirements of the applicable test method (ASTM or ISO).
