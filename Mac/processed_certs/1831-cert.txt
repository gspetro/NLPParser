This  Standard  Reference  Material  (SRM)  is  intended  for  use  in  checking  chemical  methods  of  analysis  and  in 
calibrating  instrumental  methods  of  analysis.    A  unit  of  SRM  1831  consist  of  three  platelets  37  mm  square.    The 
certified values are listed in Table 1 and represent the present best estimate of the “true value” based on the results of 
the cooperative program for certification.  All values are reported as mass fractions [1]. 
 
The  uncertainties  listed  are  expressed  as  “combined  uncertainties”  calculated  according  to  the  JCGM  and  NIST 
Guides [2].  Each uncertainty is based on the 95 % confidence limit of the “true value,” and is intended to represent 
the combined effect of uncertainty components associated with various analytical factors such as method imprecision, 
possible systematic errors among methods, and material variability.  The measurand is the total mass fraction of each 
constituent listed in Table 1, and the certified value is metrologically traceable to the SI-derived unit for mass fraction, 
expressed as percent.

‘referee  analysis
Methods Used:  The primary procedures used in the analysis of this SRM are those recommended for referee analysis 
in ASTM C 169, Standard Methods for Chemical Analysis of Soda-Lime and Borosilicate Glass.  All methods used 
in the certification of SRM 1831 are cited in Table 1.

(b)Combustion 
(c)Flame Emission 
(d)Spectrophotometry 
(e)Butyl Alcohol, HClO4 

(f)Magnesium Uranyl Acetate 
(g)KMnO4 Titration 
(h)X-ray Fluorescence 
(i)Gravimetric (8-Hydroxyquinoline) 
(j)Gravimetric (Single-Precipitation)

Expiration of Certification: The certification of SRM 1831 is valid indefinitely, within the measurement uncertainty 
specified, provided the SRM is handled in accordance with instructions given in this certificate (see “Instructions for 
Use”).  Accordingly, periodic recertification of this SRM is not required.  However, the certification is nullified if the 
SRM is damaged, contaminated, or otherwise modified.

Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate this notification. 
 
Technical  and  support  aspects  involved  in  the  original  preparation,  certification,  and  issuance  of  this  SRM  were 
coordinated through the Standard Reference Materials Program by W.P. Reed and R.K. Kirby. 
 
Office  of  Reference 
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Office  of  Reference 
Materials.  
 
CAUTION:  Before using the SRM in checking chemical analysis, it must be ground in agate to -200 mesh.   
 
Homogeneity(1):  This material was tested for homogeneity at NIST by P.A. Pella and R.L. Myklebust of the NIST 
Analytical Chemistry Division using X-ray fluorescence spectrometry.  Three to five replicate measurements were 
made on at least 10 elements in each of 15 samples chosen at random from the lot of material.  The results did not 
indicate any significant difference between the samples; the relative standard deviation for each element was less than 
1 %. 
 
The  material  for  this  SRM  was  prepared  and  furnished  to  NIST  by  The  Pittsburgh  Plate  Glass  Industries,  Inc., 
Pittsburgh, PA. 
 
Development of this SRM is part of the program of ASTM Subcommittee C14.91 on Standard Reference Materials, 
H.E.  Hagy,  Chairman.    The  overall  direction  and  coordination  of  the  cooperative  analyses  leading  to  certification 
originally and in revision to include iron oxide were performed by G.D. Bowling, Chairman of ASTM Subcommittee 
C14.02 on Chemical Properties and Analysis of Glass and Glass Products. 
 
Cooperative analyses for certification were performed in the following laboratories: 
 
Anchor Hocking Corp., Lancaster, OH 
Broadway Glass Co., Inc., Brockway, PA 
Corning Glass Works, Corning, NY 
Emhart Industries, Inc., Windsor, CT 
Ford Motor Co., Lincoln Park, MI 
Libbey-Owens-Ford Co., Toledo, OH  

Monarch Analytical Laboratories, Inc.,Toledo, OH 
Owens-Corning Fiberglass Corp., Granville, OH 
Owens-Illinois, Inc., Toledo, OH and Vineland, NJ 
Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 
Schott Glass Technologies, Inc., Duryea, PA 
Sharp-Schurtz Co., Lancaster, PA 
Thatcher Glass Co., Elmira, NY
