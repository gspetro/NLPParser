Certificate of Analysis 
 
Standard Reference Material 2392 
 
Mitochondrial DNA Sequencing (Human) 
 
This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  intended  to  provide  quality  control  when  performing  the  polymerase 
chain  reaction (PCR)  and  sequencing  of  human  mitochondrial  DNA (mtDNA)  for  forensic identifications, medical 
diagnosis, or mutation detection.  This SRM can also be used for quality assurance when assigning values to in-house 
control materials. 
 
This SRM is composed of well-characterized extracted human deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from cell culture lines 
known  as  CHR  and  GM09947A  as  well  as  cloned  DNA  from  the  HV1  region  of  CHR.    A  unit  of  SRM 2392  is 
composed of three frozen components packaged in one box.  See the section in this certificate entitled Description of 
Components for a complete listing. 
 
Certified Values:  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in 
that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or accounted for by NIST.  This SRM is certified 
for  the  sequences  of  the  entire  human  mtDNA (16 569  base  pairs)  from  two  lymphoblastoid  cell  culture  lines 
(CHR and  GM09947A)  plus  the  cloned  HV1  region  of  CHR  containing  a  C-stretch.    Table 1  contains  sequence 
differences from the Revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS) for the CHR component [1].  Table 2 contains 
the sequence differences from the rCRS for component GM09947A.  Table 3 contains the sequence differences from 
the rCRS for the cloned HV1 region of component CHR. 
 
Note:    Information  in  the  updated  certificate  has  been  tabulated  as  differences  from  the  Revised  Cambridge 
Reference  Sequence [1].    The  original  SRM 2392  certificate  listed  differences  from  the  original  Cambridge 
Reference Sequence [2].  Nomenclature is in agreement with current forensic guidelines [3,4]. 
 
Expiration  of  Certification:    The  certification  of  SRM 2392  is  valid,  within  the  measurement  uncertainties 
specified, until 31 July 2023, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given in 
The  certification  is  nullified  if  the  SRM  is 
this  certificate  (see  “Instructions  for  Storage,  Handling,  and  Use”).    The  certification  is  nullified  if  the  SRM  is 
damaged, contaminated or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance  of  SRM  Certification:    NIST  will  monitor  this  SRM  over  the  period  of  its  certification.    If 
substantive  technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will 
notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Overall  direction  and  coordination  of  the  technical  activities  leading  to  the  recertification  were  under  the 
chairmanship of P.M. Vallone of the NIST Biomolecular Measurement Division. 
 
Overall direction and coordination of the technical measurements leading to the original certification were performed 
by B.C. Levin and D.J. Reeder, formerly of NIST.  The analytical determination and technical measurements for the 
certification  of  this  SRM  were  performed  by  B.C. Levin,  H. Cheng,  L.A. Tully,  M.P. Jones  and  D.J. Reeder, 
formerly of the NIST DNA Technologies Group, Biotechnology Division.  Additional sequencing experiments for 
the  recertification  of  this  SRM  were  performed  by  P.M. Vallone,  S. Maragh  and  M.C. Kline  of  the  NIST 
Biomolecular  Measurement  Division  along  with  assistance  from  the  Armed  Forces  DNA  Identification 
Laboratory (Rockville, MD).

USE 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE, HANDLING, AND USE 

OT 

Storage:  Store frozen at a temperature of –20 ºC.  DO NOT use a self-defrosting freezer because periodic cycling 
of temperatures may cause shortened shelf life of this SRM. 
 
Warning:    SRM 2392  IS  A  HUMAN  SOURCE  MATERIAL.    SINCE  THERE  IS  NO  CONSENSUS  ON  THE 
INFECTIOUS  STATUS  OF  EXTRACTED  DNA,  HANDLE  THE  SRM 2392  COMPONENTS  AS  BIOSAFETY 
LEVEL 1  MATERIAL  CAPABLE  OF  TRANSMITTING  INFECTIOUS  DISEASE [5].    SRM 2392  components 
and derived solutions should be disposed of in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations. 
 
Instructions  for  Use:    It  is  recommended  that  once thawed, each SRM component should be used in its entirety.  
Repeated  freezing  and  thawing  is  NOT  recommended  as  this  might  shorten  the  shelf  life  of  the  SRM.    If  it  is 
necessary to perform repeated analyses, thaw the SRM and divide the tube contents into aliquots that will be kept 
frozen  until  use.    Thawing  can  be  conducted  at  refrigerator  temperatures,  room  temperature,  or  at  37 °C.    Once 
thawed, the sample should be processed without delay. 

 
SOURCE AND ANALYSIS(1) 

Source  of  Material:    CHR DNA,  both  extracted  and  cloned,  was  prepared  in the NIST Applied Genetics Group, 
Biomolecular  Measurement  Division. 
  DNA  for  GM09947A  was  prepared  by  Life  Technologies,  Inc., 
Gaithersburg, MD. 
 
NIST  Analysis:    Components  were  sequenced  using  a  modified  strategy  based  on  the  work  of  Levin  et  al. [6].  
Fluorescently-labeled  sequencing  fragments  were  separated  on  an  Applied  Biosystems 3130  Genetic  Analyzer 
capillary electrophoresis platform. 
 
Description  of  Components:    Three  components  are  included  in  each  unit;  all  components  must  be  stored  at 
−20 °C.
