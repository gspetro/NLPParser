Certified Concentration of Toxaphene:  

 
Toxaphene in Methanol 
 
This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  a  solution  of  technical  toxaphene  (Chemical  Abstracts  Registry 
Number 8001-35-2) in methanol.  This SRM is intended primarily for calibrating chromatographic instrumentation 
used  for  the  determination  of  technical  toxaphene.    Because  of  its  miscibility  with  water,  SRM 3067  can  also  be 
used  to  fortify  aqueous  samples  with  known  amounts  of  toxaphene.    A  unit  of  SRM 3067  consists  of 
five 2-mL ampoules, each containing approximately 1.2 mL of solution. 
 
Certified Concentration of Toxaphene:  The certified concentration [1] given below is based on the gravimetric 
preparation of this solution and from analytical results determined by using gas chromatography.  A NIST certified 
value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of 
bias have been investigated or taken into account [2].   
 
 
 
The results are expressed as the certified value  the expanded uncertainty.  The certified value is the unweighted 
average  of  the  concentrations  determined  by  gravimetry  and  gas  chromatographic  measurements.    The  expanded 
uncertainty, at the 95 % level of confidence, is calculated as U = kuc, where uc is a combined standard uncertainty 
calculated according to the ISO Guide [3] and k = 2 is the coverage factor.  The value of uc includes an allowance 
for differences between the concentration determined by gas chromatographic measurements for various sources of 
toxaphene  and  gravimetric  preparation.    The  concentration,  expressed  as  a  mass  concentration  (in  mg/L),  was 
obtained  by  multiplying  the  certified  value,  expressed  as  a  mass  fraction,  by  the  measured  density  of  the  SRM 
solution  at  22 °C,  0.800 g/mL  with  a  standard  deviation  (1s)  of  0.016 g/mL,  which  is  incorporated  in  the  volume 
fraction uncertainty. 
 
Reference  Mass  Fraction  Values:    Reference  mass  fraction  values  are  provided  in  Table 1  for  22 toxaphene 
congeners.  Reference values are noncertified values that are estimates of the true value; however, the values do not 
meet  the  NIST  criteria  for  certification  and  are  provided  with  associated  uncertainties  that  may  reflect  only 
measurement  precision,  may  not  include  all  sources  of  uncertainty,  or  may  reflect  a  lack  of  sufficient  statistical 
agreement among multiple analytical methods [2]. 
 
Expiration  of  Certification:    The  certification  of  SRM 3067  is  valid,  within  the  measurement  uncertainties 
specified, until 31 July 2016, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given in 
this  certificate  (see  “Instructions  for  Handling,  Storage,  and  Use”).    The  certification  is  nullified  if  the  SRM  is 
damaged, contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance  of  SRM  Certification:    NIST  will  monitor  this  SRM  over  the  period  of  its  certification.    If 
substantive technical changes occur that affect the certification before the expiration of this certificate, NIST will 
notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
The  overall  direction  and  coordination  of  the  technical  measurements  leading  to  the  certification  was  under  the 
direction of M.M. Schantz and S.A. Wise of the NIST Analytical Chemistry Division.

Consultation  on  the  statistical  design  of  the  experimental  work  and  evaluation  of  the  data  were  provided  by 
S.D. Leigh of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division. 
 
Preparation  of  the  SRM  was  performed  by  M.P. Cronise  of  the  NIST  Measurement  Services  Division  and 
M.M. Schantz of the NIST Analytical Chemistry Division. 
 
Analytical  measurements  of  the  SRM  were  performed  by S.J. Broadwater, M.M. Schantz, and S.S. Vander Pol of 
the NIST Analytical Chemistry Division. 
 
Partial support for the preparation and certification of this SRM was provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA)  Office  of  Water,  Office  of  Enforcement  and  Compliance  Assurance,  and  Office  of  Research  and 
Development. 
 
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the NIST Measurement Services 
Division. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
Handling:  This material contains toxaphene and should be handled with care.  Use proper disposal methods. 
 
Storage:  Sealed ampoules, as received, should be stored in the dark at room temperatures lower than 30 °C. 
 
Use:  Sample aliquots for analysis should be withdrawn at 20 °C to 25 °C immediately after opening the ampoules 
and  should  be  processed  without  delay  for  the  certified  and  reference  values  to  be  valid  within  the  stated 
uncertainty.    Because  of  the  volatility  of  methanol,  certified  and  reference  values  are  not  applicable  to  material 
stored in ampoules that have been opened for more than 5 minutes, even if they are resealed. 
 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS1 
 
The toxaphene used in the preparation of this SRM was obtained from the former U.S. EPA Repository, Research 
Triangle Park, NC.  The solution was prepared at NIST by weighing and mixing the toxaphene into methanol.  The 
weighed toxaphene was added to the methanol and mixed until completely dissolved and homogenized.  The total 
mass  of  this  solution  was  measured,  and  1.2 mL  aliquots  were  dispensed  into  2-mL,  argon-flushed,  amber  glass 
ampoules, which were then flame sealed. 
 
For the analysis of total toxaphene, aliquots from two sets of nine ampoules, selected randomly, were analyzed in 
duplicate  using  capillary  gas  chromatography  with  electron  capture  detection  and  an  immobilized  non-polar 
stationary phase column.  An internal standard solution containing hexachlorobenzene and PCB 209 was added to 
each sample for quantification purposes.  Calibration solutions consisting of weighed amounts of toxaphene (from 
the same source as used to prepare SRM 3067 for the first set of nine ampoules and from four different sources for 
the second set of nine ampoules) and internal standard compounds in methanol were chromatographically analyzed 
to  determine  response  factors  for  dominant  toxaphene  peaks  relative  to  the  internal  standards.    This  approach  is 
similar to EPA Method 505 (Analysis of Organohalide Pesticides and Commercial Polychlorinated Biphenyl [PCB] 
Products in Water by Microextraction and Gas Chromatography, revision 2.0). 
 
For  the  analysis  of  the  toxaphene  congeners  (Table 1),  individual  toxaphene  congeners  were  purchased  from 
commercial  sources.    Two  aliquots  from  three  ampoules  of  SRM 3067  were  gravimetrically  diluted  with  toluene 
followed  by  the gravimetric addition of  13C-labeled trans-chlordane for use as an internal standard.  The samples 
were analyzed by using gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection operated in the negative chemical 
ionization  mode (GC/NCI-MS).    The  samples  were  analyzed  on  two  columns:    a  0.25 mm i.d. × 60 m  fused  silica 
capillary column with a 5 % (mole fraction) phenyl methylpolysiloxane phase (0.25 μm film thickness; DB-5MS, Agilent 
Technologies,  Wilmington, DE)  and  a  0.25 mm i.d. × 60 m  fused  silica  capillary  column  with  a  proprietary  phase 
(0.25 μm film thickness; DB-XLB, Agilent Technologies) [4].  An example chromatogram from the DB-XLB analysis is 
shown in Figure 1. 

                                                           

1Certain commercial equipment, instrumentation, or materials are identified in this certificate to specify adequately the 
experimental procedure.  Such identification does not imply recommendation or endorsement by the NIST, nor does it imply that 
the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the purpose.
