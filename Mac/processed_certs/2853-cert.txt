Standard Reference Material® 2853 
 
Magnetic Moment Standard - Yttrium Iron Garnet Sphere 
 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended for us e in the calibration of magnetometers (such as vibrating 
sample magnetometers) used in the measurement of the ma gnetic properties of materials.  SRM 2853 consists of a 
yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere with a nominal diameter of 1 mm and a nominal mass 2.8 mg .  The SRM 2853 lot 
was produced by grinding pure (99.5 %), single-crystal YIG into spheres.  
 
Certified Values and Uncertainty:   The certified value for the specific magnetization,  σ, at 298 K in an applied 
magnetic field of 398 kA/m (5000 Oe) is: 
 
 
 
The uncertainty in the certified value is calculated as  U = kuc, where k = 2 is the coverage factor for a 95 % level of 
confidence, and  uc is the combined standard uncertainty calculated  and expressed in accordance with References 1, 
2, and 3. 
 
Corrections for temperature can be made using the equation: 
 
 
 
where  σ is the specific magnetization in Am 2/kg and T is the temperature in kelvins.  Using this correction, the 
stated uncertainty remains unchanged over the temperature range from 293 K to 303 K, providing the temp erature is 
measured to an accuracy of ± 0.5 K.   For temperatures between 250 K and 293 K, and between 303 K and 310 K, 
the uncertainties are approximately doubled.  No correctio
n for the applied field is n ecessary for fields between 
100 kA/m (1250 Oe) and 800 kA/m (10 kOe).  To determine the magnetic moment,  m, in Am2, multiply the specific 
magnetization in Am2/kg determined from Equation 2 by the SRM mass in kg.  The mass value of each SRM, at the 
time of its packaging, is provided with the unit (see note below).  
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of this SRM within th e measurement uncertainties specified is valid 
indefinitely, provided the SRM is used in accordance with
discoloration of the SRM is visible, discard the SRM.

Technical advice and assistance were 
F. Biancaniello, R.L. Park, J.G. Hodos, and R.V. Drew  of the NIST Metallurgy Division, and H.E. Metger of the 
NIST Fabrication Technology Division. 
 
The YIG spheres were prepared from pure, single-crystal YIG by Deltronic Crystal Industries, Inc., Dover, NJ. 
 
Measurement Technique:   The magnetic moment was determined by a sampling technique using an absolute 
magnetometer that was developed at NIST and is based  on the Faraday method.  The magnetometer was calibrated 
using three different methods to determine the value of the field gradient.  
 
Storage and Handling:  When not in use, store SRM 2853 in the packaging provided, or in a manner that prov ides 
equivalent or better protection against loss or damage.  The sphere should be carefully handled to avoid scratching,
 
chipping, or the attachment of magnetic dust or particles from the environment.  The use of plastic or other 
nonmagnetic tweezers with smooth surfaces an
corrosive chemicals or temperatures above 373 K (100 °C).  
 
NOTE ON MASS VALUES:  NIST DOES NOT certify the mass of ferromagnetic materials.  Mass values for this 
series of SRMs were determined in a magnetically shie lded electrobalance calibrated  using standards traceable to 
NIST.  Because the YIG sphere is ferromagnetic, the pres ence of small magnetic fields can influence the measured 
mass value.  The value given has an expanded uncertainty of ± 3 μg (with a coverage factor of 2).  
 
NOTE ON UNITS:  One oersted (Oe) corresponds to 1000/4π A/m.  For additional discussion on units of measure, 
refer to References 4 and 5. 
 

d a gentle grip is satisfactory.
