This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended for use in the calibration of all hardness and microhardness testing 
machines whereby a Vickers indentation is made and then measured with a microscope.  The SRM has five NIST-made 
indents in the middle of a polished face (Figure 1) certifie d for the individual diagonal  lengths, the average diagonal 
length, and the average hardness value for indentations made  at a load of 9.8 N (1 kgf).  A unit of SRM 2831 consists 
of a 25 mm D  × 9.5 mm disk that has a nominal hardness of approximately 15.0 GPa (1530 kgf/mm 2) packaged in a 
wooden box.  Each unit is individually certified and bears a  serial number (the letter W followed by a hyphen and the 
disk number) scribed on the opposite (bottom) face of the disk.   
 
Vickers hardness is calculated as HV =  α P/d2, where P is the indentation load, d is the average diagonal size [(d 1 + d 2  
)/2], and α is the indenter constant, which, for an ideal Vickers indenter is 1.8544.  If P is in units of Newton, and d is in 
units of meters, then HV will be in units of N/m 2 or Pa.  A conversion factor of 1  × 10-9 may be used to convert HV to 
units of GPa.  In this certificate, older traditional units of hardness expressed as kgf/mm
parenthesis for the convenience of users. 
  
Certified Values:   The certified values for Individual Diagonal 
Vickers Hardness for the NIST i ndentations for each disk are  provided in Table 1.  Special  notes regarding particular 
disks are also included in Table 1.  The uncertainty for each certified value is given below. 
 
Individual Diagonal Lengths :  The certified individual diagonal lengths in units of micrometers for the 5 NIST 
indentations for this particular disk are shown in Table 1.   The NIST indentations are identified as V1 to V5 (Figure 1). 
The average diagonal size d = (d 1 + d 2)/2 for each indentation  is listed in Tabl e 1.  The uncertainty for an individual 
NIST indentation size is  ± 0.32 µm (± 0.9 %) at a 95 % confidence level.  The number in parenthesis is two times the 
coefficient of variation expressed as a percentage.  The uncertainty for a single future (new) indentation is a little 
greater and is ± 0.35 µm (± 1.0 %) also at a 95 % confidence level. 
 
Average Diagonal Length :  The certified average diagonal length for the five NIST indentations is also listed in 
Table 1.  The uncertainty for the averag e for the five NIST indentations is  ± 0.14 µm (± 0.4 %) at a 95 % confidence 
level.  The uncertainty for the average diagonal size of five future new indentations is  ± 0.20  µm (± 0.6 %), also at a 
95 % confidence level. 
 
Average Vickers Hardness :  The certified average Vickers hardness, HV 5 for the disk is also listed in Table 1.  The 
uncertainty for the average of the five NIST indentions is ± 0.29 GPa (28 kgf/mm2).  The uncertainty for the average of 
five future (new) indentations is ± 0.41 GPa (40 kgf/mm2).  The uncertainties are at the 95 % confidence level. 
 
Expiration of Certification:   The certification of this SRM is valid indefinitely, within the measurement uncertainties 
specified, provided the SRM is handled in accordance with the  instructions given in this certificate (see  Instruction for 
Use).  However, repolishing the surface, severe corrosion damage to the surface, 
or other mechanical damage to the 
surface will invalidate the certification. 
 
This SRM was prepared and certified by G.D. Quinn and R.J. Gettings of the NIST Ceramics Division. 
 
The technical and support aspects involved in the issuance of this SRM were coordinated through the NIST 
Standard Reference Materials Program by B.S. MacDonald of the NIST Measurement Services Division.

Statistical Analysis of the data was performed by N.F. Zhang of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division. 
 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS 
 
Disk Properties:  The SRM is a hot-isostatically pressed tungs ten carbide containing nominally 12 % cobalt binder 
phase, fabricated in the form of disks that have been
surface. The average grain size (mean  linear intercept) of the carbide  grains is approximately 0.5  µm.  The disks 
have a nominal diameter of 25 mm and a thickness between 9.4 mm and 9.6 mm.  The hardness is uniform across 
the polished surface.   
 
Certification Procedures:   Five NIST Vickers indentations are located in the disk  center on the polished surface and 
are arranged in a pattern as shown in Figure 1.  A single  Knoop indentation serves as a pointer-marker.  Some disks 
have both the top and bottom surfaces polis hed.  Do not use the surface with th e scribed number.   The indentations 
were made in accordance with ASTM E 384-99 [1], ASTM  C 1327-96a [2], CEN prEN 843-4 (2001) [3], and ISO 
14705-2000 [4]. The five NIST indentations were made by  a dedicated Wilson Tukon 300 table model hardness testing 
machine.  The hardness machine applied load through a fixed ma ss (“dead weight”) attached to a lever beam.  The load 
on the indenter was nominally 9.801 N (1.000 kgf).  Load was repeatedly verified with a load cell and was within 0.1 % 
2.  The 
of the specified value.  The gravitational constant at 
Vickers diamond had average face angles of
µm.  The indenter constant was 
therefore 1.8541 and was thus within 0.02 % of the ideal 1.8544 value.    
 
The indentations were examined and digitally photographed  with a high resolution Diagnostic Instruments Spot Insight 
digital camera (3 color CCD, 11.8 mm  × 8.9 mm chip, 1600  × 1200 pixels) on a Leica DMRM laboratory research 
microscope using a 40X objective lens with a numerical apertu re of 0.6.  Bright field illumination with a green filter 
was used with properly adjusted aperture and field diaphragms.  A 1.6X slider and a 3.2X camera magnifier magnified 
the image further.  The image was projected onto a Hitachi CM 771 high-resolution (1600 
× 1280 pixel) SVGA flat 
monitor with 0.22 mm pitch.  The indentations appeared 68 mm large ( ≈ 2000 magnification) on the monitor, but were 
digitally enlarged to 200 mm (≈ 5 700 magnification) for close inspection of the diagonals and the tips.  
 
The horizontal (d 1) and vertical (d 2) diagonal lengths were measured on the computer digital image to a resolution of 
0.1 µm.  The average diagonal size was computed as d = (d
1 + d 2)/2.  The indentations were symmetric and the two 
diagonal lengths usually  concurred to 0.0  µm to 0.3  µm.  Some were different by 0.4  µm or 0.5  µm.  Only in a few 
instances were the diagonals different by 0.6 µm – 0.8 µm.  The repeatability uncertainty for making the average optical 
microscope diagonal length d reading for a single indentation was 0.13  µm at the 95 % confidence level (2 σ).  This 
uncertainty estimate was from five repeat optical microsc
measurements were done on fifty different indentations (ten indentations in five different disks). 
 
An optical stage micrometer (WILD model 31045) was used to calibrate and frequently recheck the length calibration 
measurements.  The stage micrometer was calibrated by the  NIST calibration services to  an accuracy uncertainty of 
better than 0.01 % for a length of 140 µm, which covered the entire camera field of view with the 40X objective. 
 
The polished surface was also inspected by  an optical microscope at magnifica tions of 50X to 400X for the general 
condition and evidence of any polishing or material defects.   
 
Diagonal lengths of five indentations in selected protot ype SRM disks were also measured with calibrated scanning 
electron microscope (SEM) photographs.  The average SEM lengt hs readings agreed with th e average optical readings 
to 0.1  µm or better.  Additional details on the preparation of th
publications, it was determined that a high-resolution digita
l camera attached to an opti cal microscope achieved the 
same resolution and equivalent uncertainties than measurements from calibrated SEM photos for Vickers indentations. 
 
Discussion of Uncertainties 
 
The uncertainty estimates were made in  accordance with the NIST and ISO Guides  [8,9].  Uncertainties were either 
evaluated through statistical means, type A, or by other means, type B.  Uncertainties listed are the 95 % confidence 
intervals (2σ) in each instance.  The values in  parenthesis are the uncertainties as  a percentage and are two times the 
coefficient of variation.  Uncertainties  for the average values of d and HV for th e 5 NIST indentations were estimated 
by dividing the uncertainty for an individual measurement by the square root of 5, which was the sample size. 

ope measurements of single indentations.  The repeat

Since the diagonal length for an indentation is the average of two readings (d 1 and d 2), the uncertainty  in the average 
diagonal length is less than the uncertainty for making a single diagonal length reading (d
1 or d 2) for a single 
2 / 2  =  0.707 times the single diagonal length 
indentation The uncertainty of the  average of the two readings is 
uncertainty assuming the same uncertainty of d1 and d2 . 
 
Uncertainty estimates were made by analysis of the indenta tions made in each of the 96 di sks that are certified for this 
SRM as well as a subset of five additional disks that were  set aside from the production sets.  The subset of 5 disks was 
studied in greater detail and received more indentations.   
 
For the subset of 5 disks from the production set, the within disk, between disk, and the measurement method 
repeatabilities were determined by indenting five disks with five indentations in two different locations, and then 
measuring the same indentations on 5 separate days.  An ANOVA analysis showed  that the disk effect was statistically 
significant, while the day and location effects were not significant.  From the one-way analysis and using disk as the 
µm2 with 245 degrees of freedom.  The test for homogeneity of 
factor, the mean square error (MSE) was 0.0254 
variances showed that variances between the disks were not significantly different.   
 
A one-way analysis of the diagonal length readings of the indentations in all 96 disks to be certified indicated that the 
disk effect was significant.  Therefore 
each disk is individually certified.  Th e MSE, using disk as the factor, was 
0.0262 µm2 with 384 degrees of freedom, an estimate very close to the one obtained from the five disks studied in the 
previous paragraph.  The test for homogeneity of variances  showed that the variances between the 96 disks were not 
statistically significant. 
 
The pooled variance from the two paragraphs above is 0.0259  µm2, and thus the uncertainty  for each NIST indentation 
is σe   =  0.32  µm (± 0.9 %), at a 95 % confidence level where the s ubscript “e” denotes each.  The uncertainty for the 
average of the five NIST indentations σavg is 0.32 µm / 5   =  0.14 µm (± 0.4 %). 
 
The uncertainty for a single future (new) indentation is 0.35 µm (± 1.0 %). 
The uncertainty for the average of five future (new) indentations is 0.20 µm  (± 0.6 %). 
 
Overall uncertainties were estimated by combining the variances of individual sources of uncertainty from the 
indentation load and the diagonal length measurements, with the exception of the uncertainty in HV, wherein the 
variance in diagonal length was weighted by a factor of 4 in accordance with the law of propagation of error. 
 
The uncertainty for the average hardness HV of the five NIST indentations is 0.29 GPa  (28 kgf/mm2) or ± 1.9 %. 
 
The uncertainty for average hardness HV of five future (new) indentations is 0.41 GPa (40 kgf/mm2) or ± 2.7 %. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 
 
This SRM may be used with all hardness and microhardne
made and then measured with a microscope.  
 
The user may measure the sizes of the 5 NIST indentations to within 0.1  µm (0.0001 mm) or 0.2 µm (0.0002 mm) with 
an optical microscope in order to verify that the test machine optics and the length measuring apparatus are optimized.  
A total magnification of 400X or higher is recommended and in accordance with ASTM C 1327 and ISO 14705.  400X 
or 500X magnifications are commonly available with most hardness machines, many of which have 40X or 50X 
objectives and 10X eyepieces.  The SRM may also be used  with optical microscopes with  cameras that display the 
image on a computer monitor, or with scanning electron microscopes.  
 
Magnifications and length measuring equipment should be checked by the use of a calibrated stage micrometer. 
 
The tips of the indentations may be slightly rounded or distorted by the tungsten carbide grains, which have an average 
size of 0.5  µm.  Grains near the tip may dislodge and cause the inde ntation edge to be slightly irregular as shown in 
Figure 2.  This is unavoidable, but is much less a problem with this SRM than for many ceramics.  In a few rare 
instances, a tiny hairline  crack may extend from the tip of the indent as shown in Figure 2, but these usually are very 
thin and at an angle to the diagonal length axis and can be easily discounted.  
 
Pay special attention to the Storage and Handling requirements.  Keep the blocks clean and free from fingerprints, body 
oils or salts, lab dust contamination and water.  Avoid corrosion damage to the polished surface.

Producing New Indentations:   The user may make new indentations in the disk.  Be careful not to indent over the 
NIST indentations.  Some disks have a few microstructural irregularities (small spots) or polishing scratches, which
 
may be avoided when selecting a site to be indented.  Even  if an indentation is made over a small polishing scratch, the 
scratches are so shallow that they do not alter the hardness response and the indentations are valid.  Indentations may be 
placed in any region of the polished su rface, except within 1 mm of the outer  rim since slight e dge rounding from the 
polishing may distort the indentation shape.  Some disks have a greater concentration of polishing scratches at the rim.  
The indentations should not be made too close to each other, lest they  interfere with each other.  A minimum spacing of 
4d between centers is specified in ASTM E 384, ASTM C 1327, and ISO 14705.   
 
Special care should be taken to ensure that the loading rates and load duration are as prescribed by the appropriate 
standard.  There shall be no vibrations  or impact imparted to the machine dur ing the indentation cycle.  The surface 
must be clean.  Methanol should be us ed to clean the surface in  accordance with the storage  and handling instructions 
above. 
 
Storage and Handling:   The tungsten carbide disk is hard and durable  but the polished surface should be protected 
from damage or abuse. 
 
CAUTION:   The polished surface is susceptible to corrosion from water, finger oils, body salts, or laboratory dust. 

  
It should be kept clean.  

rrosion paper also may be used, but if the paper has ink 

 
 
The disk should be stored in a container or envelope when not  in use, but such container need not be airtight.  The disk 
should be wrapped in a simple clean white tissue.  Anti co
labeling or printing on one side, then that side should not contact the disk. 
 
The disk should be handled by  the rim, with care that finger oil or sa lts do not contact the polished surface around the 
rim.  Latex gloves may be used.  If the surface is contacted 
with the fingers, water, or  other contaminant, clean the 
surface.  It is very easy to clean the surface.  The polished surface may be cleaned with simple white tissue paper and, if 
necessary, use methanol. 
 
CAUTION:  DO NOT use water or ethyl alcohol (ethanol) to clean the surface. (Ethyl alcohol has water solubility.)  
 
 
If the polished surface is contaminated by contact with water, finger oils, or finger salts for a protracted period, (days or 
weeks), corrosion damage will occur.  Such damage will manifest itself as small white patches, or in extreme cases, as a 
milky white haze across the  entire disk surface.  The disk  may still be used for indentati ons provided that indentations 
are placed in uncorroded regions.  If the disk surface is en
