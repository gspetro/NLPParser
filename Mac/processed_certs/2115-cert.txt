Low-Energy Izod Impact Specimen 
 
Evaluation Specimens for Izod Impact Machines 
 
Lot No.:  ZZ 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended primarily for use in the evaluation of Izod machines in accordance 
with the current ASTM Standard E23 [1].  Each SRM consists of a set of individual 10 mm × 10 mm × 75 mm specimens 
needed to perform one evaluation.  This SRM complies with ASTM Standard E23 dimensional requirements for the Izod 
(Cantilever Beam) impact specimen, Type D, geometry.   
 
Material Description:  SRM 2115 is made from 4340 alloy steel.  The bars are finished to length, stamped, heat-treated, 
and machined in SRM specimen lots of up to 1200.  Each specimen has a lot number (ZZ-xx, where the x’s indicate the 
sequential lot number) and an identification number (three or four digits) stamped on one end of the specimen.   
 
SRM Certification Procedure:  Specimens taken at random from each SRM lot are tested by the NIST Materials 
Reliability Division on its Izod reference machine (formerly a Charpy V-Notch reference machine).  The specimen data 
generated are then statistically evaluated to assure the homogeneity of the lot, establish the certified value, and determine 
the number of SRM specimens required for a user to perform a valid test.  See Table 1 for the approximate energy range 
within which the individual certified values should fall.  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest 
confidence in its accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or accounted for by 
NIST [2]. 
 
NOTE:  THIS IS NOT A CERTIFIED VALUE.  THIS IS THE RANGE WITHIN WHICH THE BATCHES OF 
SPECIMENS WILL FALL.

Expiration of Evaluation:  The evaluation report issued on an acceptable machine is valid for one year from the date 
that the SRM was tested.  If a user’s machine is moved or undergoes any major repairs or adjustments, the current 
evaluation will be invalidated, and the machine must be retested and reverified.  
 
Maintenance of SRM Value Assignment:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its value assignment. If 
substantive technical changes occur that affect the value assignment before the expiration of this certificate, NIST will 
notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
The  overall  direction  and  coordination  of  the  technical  measurements  leading  to  evaluation  of  test  specimens  and 
machines, evaluation of test results, and issuance of the report on machine performance are under the direction of 
T. Siewert, R. Santoyo, and C. McCowan of the NIST Materials Reliability Division (Boulder, CO).   
 
Consultation on the statistical design of the experimental work and evaluation of the data were provided by J. Splett of 
the NIST Statistical Engineering Division.

The support aspects involved in the issuance of this SRM were coordinated through the NIST Measurement Services 
Division. 
 
This  program  is  established  in  the  same  office  as the Charpy Reference Program, therefore, further information is 
available  from  the  NIST  Charpy  Program  Coordinator:  telephone  (303) 497-3351;  fax  (303)  497-5939;  or  e-mail 
charpy@boulder.nist.gov.  The lot number and energy results of the tested specimens must be provided in order to obtain 
certified values by telephone or fax.   
 
NOTICE TO USERS 
 
Important Information:  Shipping charges for the return of broken specimens are the responsibility of the user.  The 
mailing label provided with each SRM must be used to expedite shipping and, for overseas shipments, clearance by 
U.S. Customs. 
 
Note to International Customers:  Regular overseas shipments of broken specimens should be sent airmail so that after 
they are cleared by U.S. Customs, they can be forwarded directly to NIST-Boulder.  If a more rapid shipping mode is 
necessary, choose an overnight delivery service that will handle U.S. Customs clearance AND will deliver directly to 
NIST-Boulder.  Unless such delivery is assured, air freight packages may be returned to the customer by U.S. Customs. 
 
Storage:    The SRMs are composed of specimens anticipated to have an indefinite shelf life under normal storage 
conditions.  Each specimen is coated with oil, wrapped in a corrosion inhibiting paper, and sealed in a plastic envelope.  
It is recommended that the specimen be retained in this package to protect them from moisture until used.  The protective 
oil coating should be wiped from each specimen just prior to testing. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 
 
Prior to testing an Izod impact machine, the machine should be checked to assure compliance with the appropriate 
sections of the current ASTM Standard E23 [1].  As the Izod SRM is a new product, the standard does not give specific 
directions, but most procedures follow those of the Charpy specimens.  SRM 2115 is to be tested at 21 °C ± 1 °C 
(70 °F ± 2 °F).  All SRM specimens are to be tested in accordance with the testing procedures of the appropriate sections 
of the current ASTM Standard E23.  All specimens are to be tested at the same time.  An acceptable machine is expected 
to produce an average value similar to those obtained on the reference machine.  Although we do not yet have much data, 
the preliminary data indicates that machines in good operating condition should produce values similar to those in the 
Charpy Program, within 1.4 J (1.0 ft·lbf) or 5 % of the certified energy value, whichever is greater, providing the 
specimens appear to have normal markings.   
 
Evaluation of User’s Machine:  The NIST Izod Program Coordinator will issue a report of findings to the user’s facility 
upon receipt of the fractured specimens and completed questionnaire: Questionaire for Izod Impact Machine Evaluation. 
If the machine to be verified produces acceptable values and the specimens appear to have normal markings, this report 
will verify its conformance.  If the machine produces values outside the expected tolerance of the certified energy values 
or the specimens have abnormal markings, the report may suggest repair or replacement of machine parts, changes in 
testing techniques, or other appropriate corrective actions.  Fractured specimens and completed questionnaires should be 
returned to the NIST Izod Program Coordinator, Mail Code 853.07, 325 Broadway, Boulder, CO 80305-3328.  A plastic, 
self-locking  bag  is  provided  for  the  return  of  broken  specimens.    The  broken  specimens  will  be  taped  together  as 
described in the wrapping instructions included with the questionnaire.

8.   With the pendulum in the free hanging position, engage the energy indicator.  The indicator 
should read within 0.2 % of the maximum energy range being used. 
 
9.  What is the friction/windage loss of your machine?  
(Joules or ft·lbf) 
(A)  Raise the pendulum to the latched position.  Without a specimen in the machine, release the 
pendulum and permit it to swing 11 half cycles; after the pendulum starts its 11th half 
cycle, move the pointer to between 5 to 10 % of scale range capacity and record the dial 
reading.    

(Joules or ft·lbf)   

 

 

 

 

 

 

(B)  Divide the value by 11, then divide by the maximum scale range of the machine and 

 

multiply by 100. The result, friction and windage loss, should not exceed 0.4 %.  

 

 

 
10.  With the specimen removed from your machine and the pendulum released from its latched 
position, what is the dial reading after one swing? 
(Joules or ft·lbf) 
This reading should be zero.  If this reading is not zero and your machine is equipped with a compensated 
scale, please adjust the dial to read zero.  If your machine is equipped with a non-compensated scale, please 
compensate the energy values for windage and friction by subtracting the windage and friction value 
calculated in item 13.   
 
11.  When was your machine last verified by the NIST?  Date:  
 
12.  Is your machine equipped with a direct reading scale or a non-compensated scale?
