Sinusoidal Roughness Specimen 
 
Serial No.  Sample 
 
Standard Reference Material (SRM) 2073a is a sinusoidal profile roughness specimen certified for roughness average, 
Ra,  and  surface  spatial  wavelength,  D.    The  SRM  is  intended  for  use  as  a  standard  for  the  calibration  of  stylus 
instruments that are used to measure surface roughness.  A unit of SRM 2073a is a steel block of nominal Knoop 
hardness (HK) 500 which has been coated by the electroless nickel deposition process.  A sinusoidal roughness profile 
was  machined  onto  the  top  surface  of  the  specimen  in  a  facing  operation,  using  a  single-point  diamond  tool  on a 
numerically controlled lathe. 
 
The certified Ra and D values and their associated expanded uncertainties (k = 2) for this specimen are:

This SRM was originally calibrated and certified in October 1995 and was re-certified on November 23, 2009.  From 
1995  to  2008,  the  stability  of  the  SRMs  was  continually  monitored  by  routinely  measuring  NIST  check  standard 
SRM 2073 Serial Number 1104 eighty-nine times.  The NIST check standard SRM 2073 Serial Number 1104 is a 
sinusoidal profile roughness specimen with nominal values of Ra = 3 µm and D = 100 µm, which was also fabricated 
by diamond turning electroless nickel.  A dynamic control chart [1] with both dynamic and fixed control limits is used 
for monitoring the long-term variation of the certified Ra and D values for the SRM specimens.  Units of the other 
sinusoidal  profile  SRM  check  standards  have  been  measured  as  well.    The  check  measurement  results  have 
demonstrated high measurement reproducibility within the quoted uncertainty range, and no significant variations and 
drift  have  been  observed.    The  certified  values  are  metrologically  traceable  to  the  SI  unit  of  length,  expressed  in 
micrometers.  
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 2073a is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until  30 June 2024,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  in  accordance  with  instructions  given  in  this  certificate  (see 
(see 
“Instructions for Handling, Storage, and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, 
or otherwise modified.

Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification.

Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Office  of  Reference 
Materials. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE AND USE 
 
Storage:  SRM 2073a should be stored in its original wooden box in a clean dry environment at temperatures between 
10 °C and 30 °C. 
 
Handling and Use:  The stylus contact force used for measurements should cause negligible damage to the hard metal 
surface, although faint stylus traces may be visible on the surface.  Repeated use with stylus instruments can slowly 
degrade roughness specimens; however, the specimen is expected to maintain its calibration values provided these 
measurements are taken on clear, undamaged areas. 
 
Source and Preparation(1):  The SRM specimens were machined by Colorado Precision Products, Inc. (Boulder, CO) 
using a single-point diamond tool in a facing operation with a numerically controlled lathe.  The surface profile is 
highly sinusoidal as shown in Figure 1.  For certification measurements, the stylus force was approximately 4 × 10– 
4 N.

NIST Certification Procedure:  The roughness average, Ra, is the average absolute deviation of the surface peaks 
and valleys about the mean line, and is defined in the ASME B46.1-2009 standard entitled “Surface Texture” [2]. The 
surface wavelength, D, is the average period of the sinusoidal surface profile.  This quantity is also equal to the mean 
spacing of profile irregularities, RSm, as described in ASME B46.1-2009 [2] and ISO 4287:1997(E/F) [3]. 
 
The parameters Ra and D were calculated from roughness profiles of the SRM measured with a stylus instrument 
using procedures in ASME B46.1 [2].  The stylus instrument was interfaced to a laboratory computer and a HeNe 
laser interferometer, and its vertical motion was calibrated using an interferometrically measured step.  The instrument 
was operated in the skidless mode with an external reference datum.  The sampling rate was 1 point per micrometer 
over  the  evaluation  length  of  4.0 mm.    The  stylus  has  a  tip  radius  of  5 µm ± 1 µm  as  profiled  by  the  razor blade 
method [4], and calculated in accordance with ASME B46.1 [2]. 
 
The SRM was originally certified in October 1995 using a 2RC filter with a 0.76 mm long wavelength cutoff.  The 
2RC filter was the only standard filter for surface texture metrology at that time. 
 
SRM 2073a was recertified as of February 2009 for use with a Gaussian filter with a 0.8 mm cutoff.  The difference 
in the filter type causes a 0.57 % upward correction in the quoted Ra value.

The results for Ra and D are based on profile traces in pairs at each of nine evenly distributed positions on the 
specimen surface as shown in Figure 2. 
 
The certification of both parameters is valid for any unflawed positions within the area defined by the extremes of the 
profile traces shown in Figure 2.  Please note that users should measure surface profiles parallel to the long axis of the 
specimen with evaluation lengths of at least 4 mm for any calibration performed using the SRM specimen. Because 
of the curvature of the surface markings, the value for D outside the limits of the measured area is expected to increase.

Calibration  Uncertainty:    The  expanded  calibration  uncertainty  U,  for  both  Ra  and  D  is  the  combined  standard 
uncertainty uc multiplied by a coverage factor k = 2 [5, 6].  The combined standard uncertainty uc is the quadratic sum 
of  the  statistical  variation  of  the  measurements,  s,  and  a  number  of  components  associated  with  the  measurement 
system.    The  statistical  variation  of  the  measurements  is  a  Type A  uncertainty  component [5,  6],  which  is  mainly 
derived  from  the  geometrical  nonuniformity  of  the  specimen  under  test,  but  it  also  includes  instrumental  random 
variation  during  the  measurement  process.    The  statistical  variation  of  the  measurements,  s,  is  calculated  as  one 
standard deviation (1σ) of the set of values measured at different positions on the measuring area.   
 
The system standard uncertainty for Ra arises from seven sources, some of which are described in [7]: 

Ra 

1.  Geometrical  nonuniformity  and  surface  finish  of  the  step-height  used  to  calibrate  the  stylus  instrument 
producing small variations in the z-scale calibration constant of the stylus instrument from day to day. 
2.  Noise in the instrument transducer, the sampling and digitizing processes in the controller, round-off in the 
software computations, and imperfections in the surface topography of the reference datum of the instrument 
also producing variations in the z-scale calibration constant from day to day. 

3.  Variations in the measured Ra values due to nonlinearity in the instrument transducer. 
4.  Uncertainty  in  the  average  height  of  the  step-height  master  as  determined  from  interferometric  and  other 

the

3.  Variation in the temperature of the SRM itself leading to dimensional uncertainty. 
4.  Possible variation in the interferometric path-length due to possible variation in the air temperature and the 

baseplate temperature during a single measurement cycle. 

5.  Possible cosine errors in the specimen alignment. 
6.  Possible errors associated with Abbe offset. 
7.  Potential long-term variation in the surface. 

 
Component 7 is a Type A uncertainty [5,6]; components 1 to 6 are Type B uncertainties [5,6]. 
 
The combined standard uncertainty for D is calculated as uc (D) = 0.0203 µm; the combined expanded uncertainty for 
D is calculated as U (D) = 0.0407 µm, or 0.041 µm (k = 2).
