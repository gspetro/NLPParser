Certificate of Analysis 
 
Standard Reference Material® 1944 
 
New York/New Jersey Waterway Sediment 

 
Standard Reference Material (SRM) 1944 is a mixture of marine sediment collected near urban areas in New York 
and New Jersey.  SRM 1944 is intended for use in evaluating analytical methods for the determination of selected 
polycyclic  aromatic  hydrocarbons (PAHs),  polychlorinated  biphenyl (PCB)  congeners,  chlorinated  pesticides,  and 
trace  elements  in  marine  sediment  and  similar  matrices.    Reference  values  are  also  provided  for  selected 
polybrominated  diphenyl  ether (PBDE)  congeners,  selected  dibenzo-p-dioxin  and  dibenzofuran  congeners,  total 
organic  carbon,  total  extractable  material,  and  particle  size  characteristics.    Information  values  are  provided  for 
selected polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs) and hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDs).  All of the constituents for 
which certified, reference, and information values are provided in SRM 1944 were naturally present in the sediment 
before  processing.    A  unit  of  SRM 1944  consists  of  a  bottle  containing  50 g  of  radiation-sterilized,  freeze-dried 
sediment. 
 
Certified  Mass  Fraction  Values:    Certified  values  for  mass  fractions  of  PAHs,  PCB  congeners,  chlorinated 
pesticides, and trace elements are provided in Tables 1 through 4.  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST 
has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or 
taken into account [1]. The certified values for the PAHs, PCB congeners, and chlorinated pesticides are based on the 
agreement of results obtained at NIST using two or more chemically independent analytical techniques.  The certified 
values for the trace elements are based on NIST measurements by one technique and additional results from several 
collaborating laboratories. 
 
Reference Mass Fraction Values:  Reference values are provided for mass fractions of additional PAHs (some in 
combination) in Tables 5 and 6, additional PCB congeners and chlorinated pesticides in Table 7, PBDE congeners in 
Table 8, and additional inorganic constituents in Tables 9 and 10.  Reference values are provided in Table 11 for the 
2,3,7,8-substituted polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin and dibenzofuran congeners and total tetra-, penta-, hexa-, and 
hepta-congeners  of  polychlorinated  dibenzo-p-dioxin  and  dibenzofuran.    Reference  values  for  particle  size 
characteristics are provided in Table 12 and 13.  Reference values for total organic carbon and percent extractable 
mass are provided in Table 14.  Reference values are noncertified values that are the best estimate of the true value; 
however, the values do not meet the NIST criteria for certification and are provided with associated uncertainties that 
may reflect only measurement precision, may not include all sources of uncertainty, or may reflect a lack of sufficient 
statistical agreement among multiple analytical methods [1].   
 
Information Mass Fraction Values:  Information values are provided in Table 15 for mass fractions of additional 
trace  elements,  in  Table 16  for  PCN  congeners  (some  in  combination),  and  in  Table 17  for  HBCD  isomers.    An 
information  value  is  considered  to  be  a  value  that  will  be  of  interest  and  use  to  the  SRM  user,  but  insufficient 
information is available to assess the uncertainty associated with the value or only a limited number of analyses were 
performed [1].  Information values cannot be used to establish metrological traceability. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 1944 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until  31 March 2027,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  given  in  this 
certificate (see “Instructions for Handling, Storage, and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, 
contaminated, or otherwise modified.

Division  and  R. Turle  and  C. Chiu  of  Environment  Canada  Environmental  Technology  Centre,  Analysis  and  Air 
Quality Division (Ottawa, ON, Canada).  Analytical measurements for selected trace elements were provided by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA, Seibersdorf, Austria) by M. Makarewicz and R. Zeisler.  Results were 
also used from seven laboratories (see Appendix C) that participated in an intercomparison exercise coordinated by 
S. Willie  of  the  Institute  for  National  Measurement  Standards,  National  Research  Council  Canada  (NRCC; 
Ottawa, ON, Canada). 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
and  may  contain  constituents  of
Handling:  This material is naturally occurring marine sediment from an urban area and may contain constituents of 
unknown toxicities; therefore, caution and care should be exercised during its handling and use. 
 
Storage:  SRM 1944 must be stored in its original bottle at temperatures less than 30 °C away from direct sunlight. 
 
Use:  Prior to removal of test portions for analysis, the contents of the bottle should be mixed.  The concentrations of 
constituents  in  SRM 1944  are  reported  on  a  dry-mass  basis.    The  SRM,  as  received,  contains  a  mass  fraction  of 
approximately 1.3 % moisture.  The sediment sample should be dried to a constant mass before weighing for analysis 
or, if the constituents of interest are volatile, a separate test portion of the sediment should be removed from the bottle 
at the time of analysis and dried to determine the mass fraction on a dry-mass basis.

PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Sample Collection and Preparation:  The sediment used to prepare this SRM was collected from six sites in the 
vicinity of New York Bay and Newark Bay in October 1994.  Site selection was based on contaminant levels measured 
in  previous  samples  from  these  sites  and  was  intended  to  provide  relatively  high  concentrations  for  a  variety  of 
chemical classes of contaminants.  The sediment was collected using an epoxy-coated modified Van Veen-type grab 
sampler designed to sample the sediment to a depth of 10 cm.  A total of approximately 2100 kg of wet sediment was 
collected from the six sites.  The sediment was freeze-dried, sieved (nominally 250 μm to 61 μm), homogenized in a 
cone blender, radiation sterilized at an estimated minimum dose of 32 kilograys (60Co), and then packaged in screw-
capped amber glass bottles. 
 
Conversion to Dry-Mass Basis:  The results for the constituents in SRM 1944 are reported on a dry-mass basis; 
however, the material as received contains residual moisture.  The amount of moisture in SRM 1944 was determined 
by measuring the mass loss after freeze drying test portions of 1.6 g to 2.5 g for five days at 1 Pa with a –10 °C shelf 
temperature and a –50 °C condenser  temperature.  The  mass  fraction of  moisture in  SRM 1944 at the time of the 
certification analyses was 1.25 % ± 0.03 % (95 % confidence level). 
 
Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons:  The general approach used for the value assignment of the PAHs in SRM 1944 
consisted  of  combining  results  from  analyses  using  various  combinations  of  different  extraction  techniques  and 
solvents, cleanup/isolation procedures, and chromatographic separation and detection techniques [2].  Techniques and 
solvents involved were Soxhlet extraction and pressurized fluid extraction (PFE) using dichloromethane (DCM) or a 
hexane/acetone  mixture,  clean  up  of  the  extracts  using  solid-phase  extraction (SPE),  or  normal-phase  liquid 
chromatography (LC),  followed  by  analysis  using 
liquid 
chromatography with fluorescence detection (LC-FL) analysis of the total PAH fraction, (2) reversed-phase LC-FL 
analysis  of 
isolated  by  normal-phase  LC  (i.e.,  multidimensional  LC),  (3) gas 
chromatography/mass  spectrometry  (GC/MS)  analysis  of  the  PAH  fraction  on  four  stationary  phases  of  different 
selectivity,  i.e.,  a  5 %  (mole  fraction)  phenyl-substituted  methylpolysiloxane  phase,  a  50 %  phenyl-substituted 
methylpolysiloxane  phase,  a  proprietary  non-polar  polysiloxane  phase,  and  a  smectic  liquid  crystalline  stationary 
phase. 
 
Seven  sets  of  GC/MS  results,  designated  as  GC/MS (I),  GC/MS (II),  GC/MS (III),  GC/MS (IV),  GC/MS (V), 
GC/MS (VI), and GC/MS (Sm), were obtained using four columns with different selectivities for the separation of 
PAHs.  For GC/MS (I) analyses, duplicate test portions of 1 g from eight bottles of SRM 1944 were Soxhlet extracted 
for 24 h with DCM.  Copper powder was added to the extract to remove elemental sulfur.  The concentrated extract 
was  passed  through  a  silica  SPE  cartridge  and  eluted  with  2 %  DCM  in  hexane.    (All  extraction  and  LC  solvent 
compositions are expressed as volume fractions unless otherwise noted.)  The processed extract was then analyzed by 
GC/MS using a 0.25 mm i.d. × 60 m fused silica capillary column with a 5 % phenyl-substituted methylpolysiloxane 
phase (0.25 μm film thickness) (DB-5 MS, J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA).  The GC/MS (II) analyses were performed 
using  1 g  to  2 g  test  portions  from  three  bottles  of  SRM 1944  and  2 g  to  3 g  test  portions  from  three  bottles  of 
SRM 1944 that had been mixed with a similar amount of water (i.e., a wetted sediment).  These test portions were 
Soxhlet  extracted  with DCM and processed through the silica SPE as described above;  however, the extract  was 
further  fractionated  using  normal-phase  LC  on  a  semi-preparative  aminopropylsilane  column  to  isolate  the  PAH 
fraction. The PAH fraction was then analyzed using the same column as described above for GC/MS (I); however, 
the test portions were extracted, processed, and analyzed as part of three different sample sets at different times using 
different calibrations for each set.  For the GC/MS (III), 1 g to 2 g test portions from six bottles of SRM 1944 were 
Soxhlet extracted for 18 h with 250 mL of a mixture of 50 % hexane/50 % acetone.  The extracts were then processed 
and  analyzed  as  described  for  GC/MS (II).   For  GC/MS (IV)  analyses,  1 g  to  2 g  test  portions  from  six  bottles  of 
SRM 1944 were extracted using PFE with a mixture of 50 % hexane/50 % acetone, and the extracts were processed 
as  described  above  for  GC/MS (II).    The  GC/MS (V)  results  were  obtained  by  analyzing  three  of  the  same  PAH 
fractions that were analyzed in GC/MS (III) and three of the PAH fractions that were analyzed in GC/MS (IV) using 
a 50 % (mole fraction) phenyl-substituted methylpolysiloxane stationary phase (0.25 mm i.d. × 60 m, 0.25 μm film 
thickness) (DB-17MS, J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA).  For GC/MS (VI) analyses, three test portions of 0.7 g from one 
bottle of SRM 1944 were Soxhlet extracted for 24 h with DCM.  Copper powder was added to the extract to remove 
elemental sulfur.  The concentrated extract was passed through an aminopropyl SPE cartridge and eluted with 20 % 
DCM  in  hexane.    The  processed  extract  was  then  analyzed  by  GC/MS  using  a  0.25 mm  i.d.  ×  60 m  fused  silica 
capillary  column  with  a  proprietary  non-polar  polysiloxane  phase  (0.25 μm  film  thickness)  (DB-XLB,  J&W 
Scientific).  For GC/MS (Sm) 1 g to 2 g test portions from six bottles of SRM 1944 were Soxhlet extracted for 24 h

with 250 mL of DCM.  The extracts were processed as described above for GC/MS (I) using an aminopropylsilane 
SPE  cartridge  followed  by  GC/MS  analysis  using  0.2 mm  i.d.  ×  25 m  (0.15 μm  film  thickness)  smectic  liquid 
crystalline phase (SB-Smectic, Dionex, Lee Scientific Division, Salt Lake City, UT). 
 
Two sets of LC-FL results, designated as LC-FL (Total) and LC-FL (Fraction), were used in the certification process.  
Test portions of approximately 1 g from six bottles of SRM 1944 were Soxhlet extracted for 20 h using 200 mL of 
50 % hexane/50 % acetone.  The extracts were concentrated and then processed through two aminopropylsilane SPE 
cartridges connected in series to obtain the total PAH fraction.   A second 1 g test portion from the six bottles was 
Soxhlet  extracted  and  processed  as  described  above;  the  PAH  fraction  was  then  fractionated  further  on  a 
semi-preparative aminopropylsilane column (μBondapak NH2, 9 mm i.d. × 30 cm, Waters Associates, Milford, MA) 
to isolate isomeric PAH fractions.  The total PAH fraction and the isomeric PAH fractions were analyzed using a 
5-μm particle-size polymeric octadecylsilane (C18) column (4.6 mm i.d. × 25 cm, Hypersil-PAH, Keystone Scientific, 
Inc.,  Bellefonte, PA)  with  wavelength-programmed  fluorescence  detection.    For  all  of  the  GC/MS  and  LC-FL 
measurements described above, selected perdeuterated PAHs were added to the sediment prior to solvent extraction 
for use as internal standards for quantification purposes. 
 
Homogeneity  Assessment  for  PAHs:    The  homogeneity  of  SRM 1944  was  assessed  by  analyzing  duplicate  test 
test
portions of 1 g from eight bottles selected by stratified random sampling.  Test portions were extracted, processed, 
and analyzed as described above for GC/MS (I).  No statistically significant differences among bottles were observed 
for the PAHs at the 1 g test portion size.  
 
PAH Isomers of Molecular Mass 300 and 302:  For the determination of the  molecular mass 300 and 302 PAH 
isomers, three test portions of approximately 5 g each were extracted using PFE with DCM.  The extracts were then 
concentrated with a solvent change to hexane and passed through an aminopropyl SPE cartridge and eluted with 10 % 
DCM in hexane. The processed extract was then analyzed by GC/MS using a 0.25 mm i.d. × 60 m fused silica capillary 
column with a 50 % phenyl-substitued methylpolysiloxane phase (0.25 μm film thickness; DB-17MS, J&W Scientific, 
Folsom, CA).  Perdeuterated dibenzo[a,i]pyrene was added to the sediment prior to extraction for use as an internal 
standard.   
 
 
PCBs  and  Chlorinated  Pesticides:    The  general  approach  used  for  the  determination  of  PCBs  and  chlorinated 
pesticides  in  SRM 1944  consisted  of  combining  results  from  analyses  using  various  combinations  of  different 
extraction  techniques  and  solvents,  cleanup/isolation  procedures,  and  chromatographic  separation  and  detection 
techniques [2].  This approach consisted of Soxhlet extraction and PFE using DCM or a hexane/acetone mixture, clean 
up/isolation  using  SPE  or  LC,  followed  by  analysis  using  GC/MS  and  gas  chromatography  with  electron  capture 
detection (GC-ECD) on two columns with different selectivity. 
 
Eight sets of results were obtained designated as GC-ECD (I) A and B, GC-ECD (II) A and B, GC/MS (I), GC/MS (II), 
GC/MS (III), and QA Exercise.  For the GC-ECD (I) analyses, 1 g test portions from four bottles of SRM 1944 were 
Soxhlet extracted with DCM for 18 h.  Copper powder was added to the extract to remove elemental sulfur.  The 
concentrated  extract  was  passed  through  a  silica  SPE  cartridge  and  eluted  with  10 %  DCM  in  hexane.    The 
concentrated eluant was then fractionated on a semi-preparative aminopropylsilane column to isolate two fractions 
containing:  (1) the PCBs and lower polarity pesticides and, (2) the more polar pesticides.  GC-ECD analyses of the 
two fractions were performed on two columns of different selectivities for PCB separations:  0.25 mm × 60 m fused 
silica capillary column with a 5 % phenyl-substituted methylpolysiloxane phase (0.25 μm film thickness) (DB-5, J&W 
Scientific, Folsom, CA) and a 0.32 mm × 100 m fused silica capillary column with a 50 % (mole fraction) octadecyl 
(C18)  methylpolysiloxane  phase  (0.1 μm  film 
thickness)  (CPSil 5  C18  CB,  Chrompack  International, 
Middelburg, The Netherlands).  The results from the 5 % phenyl phase are designated as GC-ECD (IA) and the results 
from the C18 phase are designated as GC-ECD (IB).  A second set of samples was also analyzed by GC-ECD (i.e., 
GC-ECD IIA and IIB).  Test portions of 1 g to 2 g from three bottles of SRM 1944 and 2 g to 3 g test portions from 
three bottles of SRM 1944 that had been mixed with a similar amount of water (i.e., a wetted sediment) were extracted, 
processed, and analyzed as described above for GC-ECD (I); however, the test portions were extracted, processed and 
analyzed as part of three different sample sets at different times using different calibrations for each set.

Three sets of results were obtained by GC/MS.  For GC/MS (I), 1 g to 2 g test portions from six bottles were Soxhlet 
extracted with a mixture of 50 % hexane/50 % acetone.  Copper powder was added to the extract to remove elemental 
sulfur.  The concentrated extract was passed through a silica SPE cartridge and eluted with 10 % DCM in hexane.  
The  extract  was  then  analyzed  by  GC/MS  using  a  0.25 mm  ×  60 m  fused  silica  capillary  column  with  a  5 % 
phenyl-substituted methylpolysiloxane phase (0.25 μm film thickness).  The GC/MS (II) results were obtained in the 
same manner as the GC/MS (I) analyses except that the six test portions were extracted using PFE.  The GC/MS (III) 
analyses  were performed on the same extract fractions analyzed in GC-ECD (II) using the 5 % phenyl-substituted 
methylpolysiloxane  phase  describe  above  for  GC/MS (I).    For  both  the  GC-ECD  and  GC/MS  analyses,  two  PCB 
congeners that are not significantly present in the sediment extract (PCB 103 and PCB 198 [3]), and 4,4'-DDT-d8 were 
added to the sediment prior to extraction for use as internal standards for quantification purposes. 
 
In addition to the analyses performed at NIST, SRM 1944 was used in an interlaboratory comparison exercise in 1995 
as  part  of  the  NIST Intercomparison  Exercise  Program  for  Organic  Contaminants  in  the  Marine  Environment [4].  
Results from nineteen laboratories that participated in this exercise were used as the eighth data set in the determination 
of the certified values for PCB congeners and chlorinated pesticides in SRM 1944.  The laboratories participating in 
this  exercise  used  the  analytical  procedures  routinely  used  in  their  laboratories  to  measure  PCB  congeners  and 
chlorinated pesticides. 
 
Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers:  Value assignment of the concentrations of eight PBDE congeners was based on 
the  means  of  results  from  two  interlaboratory  studies [5,6]  and  two  sets  of  data  from  NIST.    The  laboratories 
participating in the interlaboratory exercises (see Appendix A) employed the analytical procedures routinely used in 
their laboratories to measure PBDEs.  For the two methods used at NIST, six test portions (between 1 g and 2 g) were 
extracted using PFE at 100 °C with DCM.  The extracts were cleaned up using an alumina column (5 % deactivated) SPE 
column.    Size  exclusion  chromatography  (SEC)  on  a  divinylbenzene-polystyrene  column  (10 μm  particle  size,  10 nm 
(100 angstrom) pore size, 7.5 mm i.d. × 300 mm, PL-Gel, Polymer Labs, Inc.) was then used to remove the sulfur.  The 
PBDEs, as well as PCBs and pesticides, were quantified using GC/MS in the electron impact mode on a 0.18 mm i.d. × 
30 m fused silica capillary column with a 5 % (mole fraction) phenyl methylpolysiloxane phase (0.18 μm film thickness; 
DB-5MS, Agilent Technologies).  The PBDEs were also quantified using GC/MS in the negative chemical ionization mode 
on a 0.18 mm i.d. × 10 m fused silica capillary column with a 5 % (mole fraction) phenyl methylpolysiloxane phase (0.18 μm 
film thickness; DB-5MS, Agilent Technologies).  Selected Carbon-13 labeled PBDE and PCB congeners were added to the 
sediment prior to extraction for use as internal standards for quantification purposes. 
 
Polychlorinated  Dibenzo-p-dioxins  and  Dibenzofurans:    Value  assignment  of  the  concentrations  of  the 
polychlorinated  dibenzo-p-dioxin  and  dibenzofuran  congeners  and  the  total  tetra-  through  hepta-  substituted 
polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans was accomplished by combining results from the analysis of 
SRM 1944 by fourteen laboratories that participated in an interlaboratory comparison study (see Appendix B).  Each 
laboratory analyzed three test portions (typically 1 g) of SRM 1944 using their routine analytical procedures and high 
resolution  gas  chromatography  with  high  resolution  mass  spectrometry  detection  (GC-HRMS).    The  analytical 
procedures used by all of the laboratories included spiking with 13C-labeled surrogates (internal standards); Soxhlet 
extraction  with  toluene;  sample  extract  cleanup  with  acid/base  silica,  alumina,  and  carbon  columns;  and  finally 
analysis  of  the  cleaned  up  extract  with  GC-HRMS.    Most  of  the  laboratories  used  a  5 %  phenyl-substituted 
methylpolysiloxane  phase  capillary  column 
laboratories  confirmed 
2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofuran  using  a  50 %  cyanopropylphenyl-substituted  methylpolysiloxane  (DB-225,  J&W 
Scientific, Folsom, CA) capillary column. 
 
Analytical  Approach  for  Inorganic  Constituents:    Value  assignment  for  the  concentrations  of  selected  trace 
elements was accomplished by combining results of the analyses of SRM 1944 from NIST, NRCC, IAEA, and seven 
laboratories that participated in an interlaboratory comparison exercise coordinated by NRCC [7] (see Appendix C).  
The analytical methods used for the determination of each element are summarized in Table 18.  For the certified 
concentration  values  listed  in  Table 4,  results  were  combined  from:    (1) analyses  at  NIST  using  isotope  dilution 
inductively  coupled  plasma  mass  spectrometry  (ID-ICPMS)  or  instrumental  neutron  activation  analysis (INAA), 
(2) analyses  at  NRCC  using  ID-ICPMS,  graphite  furnace  atomic  absorption  spectrometry  (GFAAS),  and/or 
inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICPOES), (3) analyses at IAEA using INAA, and (4) the 
mean of the results from seven laboratories that participated in the NRCC interlaboratory comparison exercise.  The 
reference mass fraction values in Table 9 were determined by combining results from (1) analyses performed at NIST 
using  INAA;  (2) analyses  at  NRCC  using  ID-ICPMS,  GFAAS,  ICPOES,  and/or  cold  vapor  atomic  absorption 
spectroscopy  (CVAAS);  (3) analyses  at  IAEA  using  INAA;  and  (4) the  mean  of  the  results  from  five  to  seven 
laboratories that participated in the NRCC interlaboratory comparison exercise.  The information concentration values 
in Table 15 were determined by INAA at NIST and IAEA.

NIST Analyses using ID-ICPMS:  Lead, cadmium, and nickel were determined by ID-ICPMS [8].  Test portions 
(0.4 g to 0.5 g) from six bottles of the SRM were spiked with 206Pb, 111Cd, and 62Ni and wet ashed using a combination 
of  nitric,  hydrochloric,  hydrofluoric,  and  perchloric  acids.    Lead  and  cadmium  were  determined  in  the  same  test 
portions; nickel was determined in a second sample set.  A small amount of crystalline material remained after the 
acid  dissolution.    Lithium  metaborate  fusion  was  performed  on  this  residue  to  confirm  that  the  residue  contained 
insignificant amounts of the analytes.  Cadmium and nickel were separated from the matrix material to eliminate the 
possibility of spectral interferences, and concentrations were determined from the measurement of the 112Cd/111Cd and 
62Ni/60Ni ratios, respectively.  The 208Pb/206Pb ratios were measured directly because interferences at these masses are 
negligible. 
 
NIST  Analyses  using  INAA:    Analyses  were  performed  in  two  steps [9].    Elements  with  short-lived  irradiation 
products (Al, Ca, Cl, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ti, and V) were determined by measuring duplicate 300 mg test portions from 
each of ten bottles of SRM 1944.  The samples, standards, and controls were packaged in clean polyethylene bags and 
were individually irradiated for 15 s in the NIST Reactor Pneumatic Facility RT-4.  Reactor power was 20 MW, which 
corresponds to a neutron fluence rate of about 8 × 1013 cm-2.s-1.  After irradiation, the samples, controls, and standards 
were repackaged in clean polyethylene bags and counted (gamma-ray spectrometry) three times at different decay 
intervals.  A sample-to-detector distance (counting geometry) of 20 cm was used.  Elements with long-lived irradiation 
products (Ag, As, Br, Co, Cr, Cs, Fe, Rb, Sb, Sc, Se, Th, and Zn) were determined by measuring one 300 mg test 
portion from each of nine bottles of SRM 1944.  The samples, standards, controls, and blank polyethylene bags were 
irradiated  together  for  a  total of  1 h  at  a  reactor  power  of  20 MW.    Approximately  four days  after  irradiation,  the 
polyethylene  bags  were  removed,  and  each  sample,  standard,  control,  and  blank  was  counted  at  20 cm  from  the 
detector.  The samples were then recounted at 10 cm from another detector.  After an additional decay time of about 
one month, the samples, standards, controls, and blanks were counted a third time (at 10 cm) from the second detector. 
 
Homogeneity Assessment for Inorganic Constitutents:  For some of the trace elements, most notably Cd, Fe, Pb, 
Rb, Sb, Sc, and Th, the variations among the test portions measured at NIST (between 0.3 g and 0.5 g) were larger 
than expected  from the  measurement process.   Based on experience, it  was concluded that there is some  material 
inhomogeneity for trace elements in the test portions used.  Sample variations among the NIST measurements are 
used as slightly conservative estimates of the sample inhomogeneities.   
 
Particle Size Information:  Dry particle-size distribution measurements for SRM 1944 were obtained as part of a 
collaborative  effort  with  Honeywell's  Particle  and  Components  Measurements  Laboratory  (Clearwater, FL).    A 
Microtrac particle analyzer, which  makes use of light-scattering  techniques,  was  used to  measure the particle-size 
distribution of SRM 1944.  Briefly, a reference beam is used to penetrate a field of particles and the light that scatters 
in  the  forward  direction  from  the  field  is  measured  and  the  particle-size  as  a  volume  distribution  is  derived  via  a 
computer-assisted analysis.  From these data, the total volume, average size, and a characteristic width of the particle 
size distribution are calculated.  The system has a working range from 0.7 μm to 700 μm. 
 
Total  Organic  Carbon  and  Percent  Extractable  Mass:    Four  laboratories  provided  results  for  total  organic 
carbon (TOC) using similar procedures.  Briefly, test portions of approximately 200 mg were reacted with 6 mol/L 
hydrochloric acid and rinsed with deionized water prior to combustion in a gas fusion furnace.  The carbon monoxide 
and  carbon  dioxide  produced  were  measured  and  compared  to  a  blank  for  calculation  of  the  percent  TOC.    Each 
laboratory analyzed test portions from six bottles of SRM 1944.  For the determination of percent extractable mass, 
six test portions of approximately 1 g to 2 g of SRM 1944 were extracted using Soxhlet extraction for 18 h with DCM.  
The extraction thimbles were allowed to air dry.  After reaching constant mass, the difference in the mass before and 
after extraction was determined. 
 
Polychlorinated Naphthalenes:  Value assignment of PCN congener concentrations was accomplished by combining 
results from the analysis of SRM 1944 by six laboratories that participated in an interlaboratory comparison study (see 
Appendix D).  Each laboratory analyzed three test portions (typically 1 g to 2 g) of SRM 1944 using their routine 
analytical procedures that included high-resolution gas chromatography with either high-resolution mass spectrometry 
detection (GC-HRMS) or low-resolution MS in the negative chemical ionization mode.  Calibration mixtures included 
either Halowax mixtures with known volume fractions of individual congeners or individual PCN congeners.

HBCDs:  Value assignment of the concentrations of three HBCD isomers was accomplished by combining results 
from the analysis of SRM 1944 in two sets from NIST and one set from Virginia Institute of Marine Science.  For the 
two sets analyzed at NIST, the second fraction from an acidified silica SPE clean-up was analyzed by LC/MS/MS for the 
HBCDs  using  both  electrospray  ionization (ESI)  and  atmospheric  pressurized  photoionization (APPI).    A  C18  column 
(3.0 mm × 150 mm × 3.5 μm column, Eclipse Plus, Agilent Technologies) and YMC Carotenoid S5 C30 column (4.6 mm 
× 250 mm × 5 μm column) were used with a solvent gradient using 2.5 mmol/L ammonium acetate in 12.5 % water in 
methanol and acetonitrile at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min.  Carbon-13 labeled HBCDs were added to the sediment prior to 
solvent extraction for use as internal standards for quantification purposes.          
 
The measurands for certified values are the total concentrations of the analytes listed in Tables 1-4.  Metrological 
traceability is to the SI derived units for mass fraction, expressed as milligrams per kilogram, micrograms per kilogram 
or percentage, respectively.

(a) The certified value is the mean of four results: (1) the mean of NIST INAA or ID-ICPMS analyses, (2) the mean of two methods 
performed at NRCC, and (3) the mean of results from seven selected laboratories participating in the NRCC intercomparison 
exercise, and (4) the mean results from INAA analyses at IAEA.  The expanded uncertainty in the certified value is equal to 
U = kuc where uc is the combined standard uncertainty and k is the coverage factor, both calculated according to the ISO/JCGM 
Guide [11,12].  The value of uc is intended to represent at the level of one standard deviation the combined effect of all the 
uncertainties in the certified value.  Here uc accounts for both possible method biases, within-method variation, and material 
inhomogeneity.  The coverage factor, k, is the Student's t-value for a 95 % confidence interval with the corresponding degrees 
of freedom.  Because of the material inhomogeneity, the variability among the measurements of multiple samples can be expected 
to be greater than that due to measurement variability alone.

(a) The reference value is the equally weighted mean of available results from:  (1) NIST INAA analyses, (2) two methods performed 
at NRCC, (3) results from seven selected laboratories participating in the NRCC intercomparison exercise, and (4) results from 
INAA analyses at IAEA.  The expanded uncertainty in the reference value is equal to U = kuc where uc is the combined standard 
uncertainty and k is the coverage factor, both calculated according to the ISO/JCGM Guide [11,12].  The value of uc is intended 
to represent at the level of one standard deviation the uncertainty in the value.  Here uc accounts for possible method differences, 
within-method variation, and material inhomogeneity.  The coverage factor, k, is the Student's t-value for a 95 % confidence 
interval with the corresponding degrees of freedom.  Because of material inhomogeneity, the variability among the measurements 
among  the  measurements
of multiple test portions can be expected to be greater than that due to measurement variability alone.

(a) The reference  value is based on the results from an INAA study.  The associated uncertainty accounts for both random and 
systematic effects, but because only one method was used, the results should be used with caution.  The expanded uncertainty in 
the reference value is equal to U = kuc where uc is the combined standard uncertainty and k is the coverage factor, both calculated 
according to the ISO/JCGM Guide [11,12].  The value of uc is intended to represent at the level of one standard deviation the 
uncertainty in the value.  Here uc accounts for possible method differences, within-method variation, and material inhomogeneity.  
The  coverage  factor,  k,  is  the  Student's  t-value  for  a  95 %  confidence  interval  with  the  corresponding  degrees  of  freedom.  
Because of  material inhomogeneity, the variability among the  measurements of  multiple test portions can be expected to be

(a) Mass fraction is reported on a dry-mass basis; material as received contains approximately 1.3 % moisture. 
(b) The  reference  value  for  total  organic  carbon  is  an  equally  weighted  mean  value  from  routine  measurements  made  by  three 
laboratories.  Each uncertainty, computed according to the CIPM approach as described in the ISO/JCGM Guide [11,12], is an 
expanded uncertainty at the 95 % level of confidence, which includes random sources of uncertainty.  The expanded uncertainty 
defines a range of values for the reference value within which the true value is believed to lie, at a level of confidence of 95 %.

(c) Extractable mass as determined from Soxhlet extraction using DCM. 
(d) The reference value for extractable mass is the mean value of six measurements.  Each uncertainty, computed according to the 
CIPM approach as described in the ISO/JCGM Guide [11,12], is an expanded uncertainty at the 95 % level of confidence, which 
includes random sources of uncertainty.  The expanded uncertainty defines a range of values for the reference value within which 
the true value is believed to lie, at a level of confidence of 95 %.
