Certificate of Analysis 
 
Standard Reference Material 1547 
 
Peach Leaves 
 
This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  use  in  validating  analytical  methods  for  the 
determination  of  major,  minor,  and  trace  elements  in  botanical  materials,  agricultural  food  products,  and  similar 
materials.  This SRM can also be used for quality assurance when assigning values to in-house control materials.  A 
unit of SRM 1547 consists of 50 grams of dried peach leaves of the Coronet variety. 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values:  Certified mass fraction values for elements in SRM 1547, reported on a dry-mass 
basis, are provided in Table 1.  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its 
accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [1].  Analyses for 
value assignment were performed by NIST and collaborating laboratories.  Certified values were calculated using the 
results from a single definitive method or the weighted means of results from two or more different analytical methods 
combined  using  the  DerSimonian-Laird  procedure [2–4].    The  associated  uncertainties  are  expressed  at  an 
approximately 95 % level of confidence [5,6].   
 
Information Mass Fraction Values:  Information mass fraction values for several elements are provided in Table 2 
as additional information on the composition of the material.  A NIST information value is a value that may be of 
interest to the SRM user, but insufficient information is available to assess the uncertainty associated with the value, 
and  therefore  no  uncertainty  is  provided [1].    Values  are  reported  on  a  dry-mass  basis  in  mass  fraction  units [7].  
Information values cannot be used to establish metrological traceability. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 1547 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until  01 March 2027,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  given  in  this 
certificate (see “Instructions for Storage and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, 
or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Coordination of the technical measurements leading to the certification of this SRM was performed by D.A. Becker 
of the former NIST Inorganic Analytical Research Division.  Revision of this certificate was coordinated by L.J. Wood 
of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division.

RESEARCH 

Analyses for value assignment were also performed by D.L. Anderson (Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration, College Park, MD), A.R. Byrne and B. Smodis (Jozef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana, 
Slovenia), J. Kucera (Nuclear Physics Institute, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Rez, Czech Republic), 
and N. Miller-Ihli, (Nutrient Composition Laboratory, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Beltsville, MD). 
 
NOTICE AND WARNING TO USERS   
 
SRM 1547 IS INTENDED FOR RESEARCH USE ONLY. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE AND USE 
 
Storage:    The  SRM  should  be  stored  in  the  dark  at  controlled  room  temperature  (20 °C  to  25 °C)  in  its  original 
unopened bottle, until required for use.  The SRM should not be exposed to intense sources of radiation.  The bottle can 
be resealed and test portions removed and analyzed until the material reaches its expiration date.   
 
Use:  The contents of the bottle should be thoroughly mixed by rotating and/or rolling the bottle before each use.  Allow 
the  contents  to  settle  for  one minute  prior  to  opening  to  minimize  the  loss  of  fine  particles.    To  relate  analytical 
determinations to the certified values in this certificate, the test portion mass indicated in the description of the NIST 
analyses for each group of analytes (see “Source, Preparation, and Analysis” below) should be used.  Test portions 
should be taken by gently tapping material needed from the SRM bottle.  Results in this certificate are reported on a 
dry-mass  basis;  sample(s)  need  to  be  dried  using  one  of  the  recommended  techniques  (see  “Determination  of 
Moisture”) to compare results to certified values found in this certificate.  Results obtained in analyses should include 
their  own  estimates  of  uncertainty  and  can  be  compared  to  the  certified  values  using  procedures  described  in 
reference 8.   
 
Determination  of  Moisture:    Moisture  content  of  SRM 1547  was  determined  at  NIST  by (1) drying  over  fresh 
anhydrous  magnesium perchlorate in a desiccator at room temperature for 120 h (sample depth should not exceed 
1 cm) and (2) freeze drying for 24 h at a pressure of 13.3 Pa or lower and a shelf temperature of –5 °C or lower after 
having frozen the sample (not to exceed 1 cm in depth) at –40 °C or lower for at least 1 h.  At the end of the 24-h period, 
samples were placed immediately in a desiccator with fresh anhydrous magnesium perchlorate.  Samples were weighed 
after allowing a minimum of 4 h to establish temperature equilibrium.  It is preferable to analyze volatile elements such 
as mercury from the bottle without drying, determine the moisture content on a separate sample from the same bottle, 
and correct the analytical results to a dry-mass basis. 
 
Vacuum drying at room temperature and oven drying at elevated temperatures have resulted in excessive mass losses 
NOT 
and therefore are NOT recommended.   
 
SOURCE, PREPARATION, AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Source and Preparation:  The material for this SRM is leaves representative of healthy Georgia peach trees, variety 
“Coronet”, picked from a field in Peach County, GA (150 miles south of Athens, GA).  The plant material for this 
SRM  was  collected  and  prepared  under  the  direction  of  R.A. Isaac,  Soil  Testing  &  Plant  Analysis  Laboratory,  The 
University of Georgia College of Agriculture.  Fungicide and insecticide sprays were controlled to minimize heavy metal 
contamination.  The leaves were dried and ground in a stainless-steel mill to pass a 1 mm screen.  At NIST, the ground 
leaves were jet milled and air classified to a particle size of approximately 75 μm (200 mesh).  Prior to bottling, the 
material was irradiated by 60Co to an estimated minimum absorbed dose of 27.8 kGy for microbial control. 
 
Analytical  Approach  for  Determination  of  Elements:   Value  assignment  of  the  mass  fractions  of  elements  in 
SRM 1547 was based on measurements provided by NIST and collaborating laboratories, where appropriate.  NIST 
provided measurements by using cold-vapor atomic absorption spectrometry (CVAAS), direct current plasma optical 
emission spectrometry (DCP-OES), flame atomic emission spectrometry (FAES), hydride generation atomic absorption 
spectrometry  (HGAAS),  inductively  coupled  plasma  optical  emission  spectrometry (ICP-OES),  isotope  dilution 
inductively  coupled  plasma  mass  spectrometry (ID ICP-MS), 
ionization  mass 
spectrometry (ID TIMS),  instrumental  neutron  activation  analysis (INAA),  Kjeldahl nitrogen determination (KJEL), 
laser-enhanced 
radiochemical  neutron  activation 
analysis (RNAA).   

ionization  spectrometry (LEIS),  polarography (POL),  and

(1)  Certain  commercial  equipment,  instruments  or  materials  are  identified  in  this  certificate  to  adequately  specify  the 
ndards 
experimental procedure.  Such identification does not imply recommendation or endorsement by the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the purpose.

NIST Analyses for Hg by CVAAS:  The mass fraction of mercury was determined by CVAAS from duplicate, nominal 
2 g test portions taken from three bottles of SRM 1547.  Samples were placed in digestion flasks with 10 mL HNO3 
and 5 mL H2SO4 and heated gently for 2 h.  Next, 5 mL of HClO4 were added to each flask, and the solutions were 
heated to sulfuric acid fumes.  Solutions were transferred to volumetric flasks where K2Cr2O7 was added until each 
solution turned yellow.  Solutions were diluted to 100 mL.  Quantification was based on a five-point calibration curve. 
 
NIST Analyses for Fe, Na, P, and Rb by DCP-OES or FAES:  Mass fractions of iron and phosphorus were determined 
by DCP-OES.  Mass fractions of rubidium and sodium  were determined by FAES.  For each technique, duplicate, 
nominal  1 g  test  portions  were  taken  from  three  bottles  of  SRM 1547.    Samples  were  mixed  with  1 g  lithium 
metaborate in a platinum crucible, placed in a muffle furnace, allowed to reach a temperature of 1000 °C, and held for 
1 h.  When cool, the crucibles were placed in a beaker and shaken overnight in 5 % HNO3.  Solutions were diluted to 
100 mL.  Quantification was based on the method of standard additions using the SRM 3100 series single element 
standard solutions.  
 
NIST  Analyses  for  As  and  Se  by  HGAAS:  Duplicate,  nominal  1  g  test  portions  were  taken  from  three  bottles  of 
SRM 1547. Samples were digested under reflux conditions using a HNO3/HClO4/H2SO4 acid mixture until fumes of 
H2SO4 appeared. Samples were cooled and 2 mL of HCl were added, solutions were heated for 15 min at near boiling 
then transferred to 100 mL volumetric flasks. For determination of As, a solution of 10 % KI and 5 % ascorbic acid 
was added to each sample and allowed to stand for 1 h to reduce As. For determination of Se, a solution of 10 % HCl 
and 0.5 % sodium borohydride was used as a reducing agent. 
 
NIST Analyses for Al and P by ICP-OES:  Mass fractions of aluminum and phosphorus were determined by ICP-OES 
from duplicate, nominal 1 g test portions taken from three bottles of SRM 1547.  Samples for P analyses were placed 
in Teflon beakers and wet ashed with a HNO3/HF/HClO4 acid mixture.  Samples for Al analyses were mixed with 1 g 
lithium metaborate in a platinum crucible, placed in a muffle furnace, allowed to reach a temperature of 1000 °C, and 
held for 1 h.  When cool, the crucibles were placed in a beaker and shaken overnight in 5 % HNO3.  Solutions were 
diluted to 100 mL.  Quantification for Al and P was based on the method of standard additions using the SRM 3100 
series single element standard solutions. 
 
NIST Analyses for B, Ba, Cd, Mo, Ni, and Sr by ID ICP-MS:  Mass fractions of boron, barium, molybdenum, nickel, 
three 
and strontium were determined by ID-ICP-MS from duplicate, nominal 1.0 g test portions taken from each of three 
bottles  of  SRM 1547.    Single  2.0 g  test  portions  were  taken  from  each  of  six  bottles  for  cadmium  measurements.  
Samples  were  spiked  with  isotopically  enriched  135Ba,  111Cd,  97Mo,  62Ni,  and  86Sr  and  then  wet  ashed  with  a 
HNO3/HF/HClO4 acid mixture in Teflon beakers.  For boron, samples were spiked with isotopically enriched 10B and 
then were dissolved in quartz flasks with reflux condensers using a HNO3/H2O2 mixture.  The digests were placed on 
either a cation or an anion exchange column to selectively remove the elements of interest.  The isotopic ratios were 
measured by ICP-MS using standard operating conditions.  Quantification for the above analyses was based on the 
method of spiked calibrations using precisely weighed high purity metals of known origin. 
 
NIST Analyses for Ca, Pb, Mg, and K by ID TIMS:  Mass fractions of calcium, lead, magnesium, and potassium in 
SRM 1547 were determined by ID TIMS from duplicate, nominal 1.0 g test portions taken from each of three bottles 
of SRM 1547.  Samples were spiked with isotopically enriched 42Ca, 206Pb, 41K and 26Mg and then wet ashed with a 
HNO3/HF/HClO4 acid  mixture in Teflon beakers.  The digests  were placed on either an anion or cation exchange 
column  to  selectively  remove  the  elements  of  interest.    Thermal  ionization  was  performed  using  a  triple  filament 
procedure and internal  normalization of  measured ratios.   Quantification for the above  analyses  was based on the 
method of spiked calibrations using precisely weighed high purity metals of known origin. 
 
NIST Analyses for N by KJEL:  The mass fraction of nitrogen was determined by KJEL from single, nominal 2 g test 
portions taken from six bottles of SRM 1547.  Sample preparation was based on the AOAC method 2.057, Improved 
Method for Nitrate-Free Samples, 14th edition. 
 
NIST  Analyses  for  Mn  and  Ni  by  LEIS:    Mass  fractions  of  manganese  and  nickel  were  determined  by  LEIS  from 
duplicate, nominal 0.5 g test portions taken  from each of three bottles of SRM 1547.   Samples  were digested in a 
microwave  sample preparation system  with  subsequent  hot plate digestion using a  HNO3/HF/HClO4 acid  mixture.  
Single wavelength excitation was performed at 279.83 nm for manganese and 300.25 nm for nickel.  Quantification 
was based on the method of standard additions using SRM 3132 Manganese (Mn) Standard Solution and high purity 
metals of known origin.

SRM 1547.  Samples, controls, and standards were pressed into cylindrical pellets, packaged individually in clean 
polyethylene  bags,  and  irradiated  for  60 s.    For  determination  of  aluminum  and  vanadium,  radioactive  decay  was 
counted for 6 min after a decay of 2 min.  For determination of calcium and magnesium, radioactive decay was counted 
for 12 min after a decay of 9 min.  For determination of chlorine, radioactive decay was counted for 30 min after a 
decay of 22 min.  For determination of barium, manganese, sodium, and potassium, radioactive decay was counted 
for 5 h to 8 h after a decay of 60 min.  For determination of iron, rubidium, selenium, and zinc, radioactive decay was 
counted for at least 3 d after a decay of 60 d to 120 d.  Quantification was based on pure elements or compounds on 
compressed filter papers and foil fluence monitors. 
  
NIST Analyses for As, Cd, Cu, Mo, and Se by RNAA:  Mass fractions of arsenic, cadmium, copper, molybdenum, and 
selenium were determined by RNAA from duplicate, nominal 0.15 g test portions taken from each of three bottles of 
SRM 1547.  Samples were placed in quartz vessels and irradiated for 2 h at 19 MW.  After several days, samples were 
transferred  to Teflon  vessels  using  a HNO3/HF/HClO4  acid  mixture.    Samples  were  heated,  the  acid  reduced,  and 
samples brought up to volume in 1 mol/L HNO3.  Samples were passed through a column and fractions separated.  
Fractions were counted immediately for As and Se, after a 24 h decay for Cd and Cu, and after a 48 h decay for Mo.  
Quantification was based on irradiated and un-irradiated standard solution carriers added to sample materials. 
 
NIST  Analyses  for  Cu  and  Zn  by  POL:    Mass  fractions  of  copper  and  zinc  in  SRM 1547  were  determined  by 
polarography from duplicate, nominal 0.7 g test portions taken from each of three bottles of SRM 1547.  Samples 
were weighed into PFA pressure vessels with 5 g HNO3, 2 g HF, and 10 g HClO4 and heated for 12 h.  Additional HF 
and HClO4 were added and the vessels were heated for 30 h.  Determinations were performed by differential pulse 
polarography using a PAR 384B electrode stand.  Copper was determined in 0.5 mol/L HNO3 using the method of 
standard additions.  Zinc was determined in 0.25 mol/L CH3COOH + 0.25 mol/L NH4CHOO buffer, pH 4.7, using a 
3-point calibration curve. 
 
Homogeneity Assessment:   The homogeneity was assessed at NIST using INAA and test portion sizes described 
above  from  randomly  selected  bottles  of  SRM 1547.    No  evidence  of  statistically  significant  inhomogeneity  was 
observed. 
 
Value  Assignment:    Calculations  of  assigned  values  are  based  on  results  from  a  single  definitive  method  or  on 
weighted means of multiple assessments of the mass fraction of each element made using different chemical methods 
or  in  different  laboratories.    Weighted  means  were  calculated  using  the  DerSimonian-Laird  procedure [2],  which 
weights the results from each method in proportion to the inverse of the square of its uncertainty.  The weights include 
uncertainty contributions from both between- and within-method dispersion of values.

Certified Mass Fraction Values for Elements:  Each certified mass fraction value is the combined mean from the 
means of NIST data and the results provided by collaborating laboratories, where appropriate.  Values are expressed 
as x ± U95%(x), where x is the certified value and U95%(x) is the expanded uncertainty of the certified value. The true 
value  of  the  analyte  is  believed  to  lie  within  the  interval  x  ±  U95%(x)  with  95 %  confidence.  To  propagate  this 
uncertainty, treat the certified value as a normally distributed random variable with mean x and standard uncertainty 
U95%(x)/2  [2–4]. The  measurand  is  the  total  mass  fraction  for  each  analyte  listed  in  Table  1,  on  a  dry-mass  basis. 
Metrological traceability is to the SI derived unit for mass fraction (expressed as milligrams per kilogram).
