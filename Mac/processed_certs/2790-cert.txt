This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended for use in validating methods for the determination of elements 
in  hardwood  biomass  materials  and  similar  matrices,  and  for  qualifying  in-house  control  materials.    A  unit  of 
SRM 2790 consists of two bottles each containing approximately 30 g of material. 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values:  Certified mass fraction values of elements in SRM 2790, reported on a dry-mass 
basis, and ash are provided in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the 
highest confidence in its accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into 
account [1].  Analyses for value assignment were performed by NIST.  Certified mass fraction values were calculated 
as the mean of the mean values from NIST methods.  The associated uncertainties are expressed at an approximately 
95 % level of confidence [2–4].   
 
Reference Mass Fraction Values:  Reference mass fraction values for additional elements in SRM 2790, reported on 
a dry-mass basis, are provided in Table 3.  A NIST reference mass fraction value is a noncertified value that is the best 
estimate  of  the  true  value  based  on  available  data;  however,  the  values  do  not  meet  the  NIST  criteria  for 
certification [1]  and  are  provided  with  an  uncertainty  that  may  reflect  only  measurement  reproducibility,  may  not 
include all sources of uncertainty, or may reflect a lack of sufficient statistical agreement among multiple analytical 
methods.  The reference mass fraction values were derived from results reported by NIST. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 2790 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until  30 June 2028,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  given  in  this 
certificate (see “Instructions for Storage and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, 
or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification: NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Coordination of the technical measurements leading to the certification of this SRM was performed by L.J. Wood and 
R. Oflaz of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division.  
 
Analytical  measurements  at  NIST  were  performed  by  C.A. Barber,  J.F. Browning,  K.D. Chieh,  S.E. Long, 
A.F. Marlow, A.J. Moors,  J.M. Ness,  R. Oflaz,  R.L. Paul,  R.S. Pugh,  N.E. Sharp,  and  L.J. Wood  of  the  NIST 
Chemical Sciences Division.  
 
Statistical analysis was provided by J.H. Yen of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division. 
 
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Office  of  Reference 
Materials.

NOTICE TO USERS 
 
SRM 2790 IS INTENDED FOR RESEARCH USE. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE AND USE 
 
Storage:  The SRM should be stored in the original, unopened bottle at room temperature (20 °C to 25 °C) until required 
for use.  The bottle can be closed and test portions removed and analyzed until the material reaches its expiration date. 
 
ghly.  Allow  the 
Use: Prior to removal of a test portion for analysis, the contents of the bottle should be mixed thoroughly.  Allow the 
contents  to  settle  for  one minute  prior  to  opening  to  minimize  the  loss  of  fine  particles.    To  relate  analytical 
determinations to the certified values in this Certificate of Analysis, a test portion mass size of at least 0.2 g should be 
used when determining Ag, Al, As, Ce, Cl, Co, Cr, Cs, Fe, K, La, Mg, Mn, Na, Rb, Sb, Sc, Se, Sm, Th, V, W, and  
Zn; a test portion mass size of at least 0.25 g should be used when determining Hg; a test portion mass size of at least 
0.5 g should be used when determining Cu; and a test portion mass size of at least 1 g should be used when determining 
B,  C,  H,  and  ash.    Test  portions  should  be  analyzed  as  received  and  results  converted  to  a  dry-mass  basis  (See 
“Determination  of  Moisture”).    Analytical  results  obtained  in  analyses  should  include  their  own  estimates  of 
uncertainty and can be compared to the listed values using procedures described in references 5 and 6. 
 
Determination of Moisture:  Moisture content of SRM 2790 was determined at NIST by (1) freeze-drying to constant 
mass over 7 d; (2) drying over magnesium perchlorate in a desiccator at room temperature for 14 d; and (3) drying in 
a forced air oven for 2 h at 90 °C.  Unweighted results obtained using all three techniques were averaged to determine 
a conversion factor of (0.9700 ± 0.0072) gram dry-mass per gram as-received mass, which was used to convert data 
from an as-received to a dry-mass basis; the uncertainty shown on this value is an expanded uncertainty to represent 
a 95 % level of confidence.  An uncertainty component for the conversion factor (0.4 %) obtained from the moisture 
measurements is incorporated in the uncertainties of the certified and reference values, reported on a dry-mass basis, 
that are provided in this certificate. 
 
SOURCE, PREPARATION, AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 

 

Preparation:    SRM 2790  was  prepared  from  wood  pellet  fuel  to  support  biomass  energy,  biomass  technology 
developments,  and  environmental  impact  assessments.    The  material  was  purchased  commercially  as  five  1 cu. ft. 
bags  that  were  sent  to  the  NIST  Reference  Material  Production  facility  (ISO  certified  Class  7  clean  room)  in 
Charleston, SC.  The material was first cryomilled and then cryohomogenized.  The material was shipped to NIST 
Gaithersburg for jet milling, irradiation (Neutron Products, Inc., Dickerson, MD) to an absorbed dose of 7.9 kGy to 
9.5 kGy, and bottling.   
 
NIST Analytical Approach for Determination of Elements:  Value assignment of the mass fractions of elements 
in SRM 2790 was based on the combination of  measurements provided by NIST using  inductively couple plasma 
mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), inductively couple plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), isotope dilution 
cold vapor inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ID/CV ICP-MS), instrumental neutron activation analysis 
(INAA), and prompt gamma neutron analysis (PGAA).   
 
NIST Analyses for As, Cr, Co, Cs, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Se, V, and Zn using ICP-MS and ICP-OES:  Mass fractions 
of arsenic, cesium, chromium, cobalt, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, potassium, selenium, sodium, vanadium, 
and zinc were determined by either ICP-MS or ICP-OES in duplicate 0.5 g test portions taken from each of six bottles 
of  SRM 2790.    Samples  were  digested  in  a  microwave  sample  preparation  system  using  a  HNO3:HF  solution.  
Quantification was based on the method of standard additions using calibration solutions prepared from the SRM 3100 
series of single-element standard solutions. 
 
NIST Analyses for Hg using ID/CV ICP-MS: The mass fraction of  mercury  was determined by ID/CV ICP-MS in 
single,  nominal  0.25 g,  test  portions  taken  from  each  of  eight  bottles  of  SRM 2790.    Samples  were  digested  in  a 
microwave  sample  preparation  system  using  a  HNO3:HCl  solution.    Measurements  were  made  using  cold-vapor 
mercury generation coupled with ICP-MS.  Quantification was based on reverse isotope dilution with a 201Hg stock 
solution and SRM 1641d Mercury in Water.

magnesium,  manganese,  potassium,  rubidium,  samarium,  scandium,  selenium,  silver,  sodium,  thorium,  tungsten, 
vanadium,  and,  zinc  were  determined  by  INAA  using  duplicate,  nominal  0.2 g  test  portions  taken  from  each  of 
12 bottles of SRM 2790.  For the analysis of antimony, arsenic, cerium, cesium, chromium, cobalt, iron, lanthanum, 
rubidium, samarium, scandium, selenium, silver, thorium, tungsten, and zinc, powders were pressed into cylindrical 
pellets, and samples, standards, and controls were packaged individually in clean polyethylene bags and irradiated in 
a single rabbit at 20 MW for 16 h with a 180-degree inversion after 8 h.  Nuclides were counted for 12 h after a 14 d 
decay (Ag, Ce, Co, Cr, Cs, Fe, Rb, Sb, Sc, Se, Th, Zn) or 2 h after a 5 d decay (As, La, Sm, W).   For analysis of 
aluminum,  chlorine,  magnesium,  manganese,  potassium,  sodium,  and  vanadium  each  sample,  standard,  or  control 
material  was  individually  irradiated  together  with  one  flux  monitor  foil  for  120 s  at  a  reactor  power  of  20 MW.  
Nuclides were counted for 5 min and 30 min after decays of 5 min and 15 min, respectively.  Quantification is based 
on validated pure metal foils, pure compounds, or the SRM 3100 single element standard solutions. 
 
NIST  Analyses  for  B,  C,  K,  and  H  using  PGAA:  Mass  fractions  of  boron,  carbon,  potassium,  and  hydrogen  were 
determined by PGAA using single, nominal 1 g test portions taken from each of eight bottles of SRM 2790.  Samples 
were irradiated for 24 h.  Gamma rays were measured using a reverse electrode high purity germanium detector.  The 
2223 keV,  477 keV,  770 keV,  and  4945 keV  peaks  were  integrated  for  hydrogen,  boron,  potassium,  and  carbon, 
respectively.  Quantification was based on SRM 912a Urea, SRM 918b Potassium Chloride Clinical Standard, and 
SRM 3107 Boron (B) Standard Solution. 
 
NIST Analytical Approach for Determination of Ash:  Value assignment of the mass fraction of ash in SRM 2790 
was based on the combination of measurements provided by NIST using thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) (LECO 
Model 701)  and  muffle  furnace.    Nominal  1 g  samples  were  held  for 3 h  at  575 °C  using  either  TGA  or  a  muffle 
furnace.  Quantitation was based on the standard mass set maintained by the Inorganic Chemical Metrology Group. 
 
Homogeneity Assessment:  To address issues of possible inhomogeneity of the SRM, analyses of variance with 5 % 
significance level and graphical analyses were run on NIST data where box information was available.  For As, La, 
Mn,  Na,  Sm,  and  W,  the  uncertainty  incorporates  a  component  for  possible  inhomogeneity  based  on  the  standard 
deviation.   
 
Value Assignment:  The certified mass fraction values in this SRM were derived from results of analyses performed 
by NIST using the mean of the mean values from NIST results.  The uncertainty of the combined mean is estimated 
using a bootstrap procedure based on a Gaussian random effects model for the between-method effects [2–4].

Certified Mass Fraction Values:  Each certified mass fraction value listed in Table 1 is the combined mean from 
each set of analyses by NIST.  Values are expressed as x ± U95%(x), where x is the certified value and U95%(x) is the 
expanded  uncertainty  of  the  certified  value.    The  true  value  of  the  analyte  is  believed  to  lie  within  the  interval 
x ± U95%(x) with 95 % confidence.  To propagate this uncertainty, treat the certified value as a normally distributed 
random variable with mean x and standard deviation U95%(x)/2 [2–4].  The measurand is the total mass fraction for 
each analyte listed in Table 1, on a dry-mass basis.  Metrological traceability is to the SI derived unit for mass fraction 
(expressed as milligrams per kilogram).

Certified Mass Fraction Value for Ash:  The certified mass fraction value for ash is the mean of the means from the 
sets of analyses by NIST using TGA and muffle furnace.  Values are expressed as x ± U95%(x), where x is the certified 
value and U95%(x) is the expanded uncertainty of the certified value.  The true value of the analyte is believed to lie 
within the interval x ± U95%(x) with 95 % confidence [2].  To propagate this uncertainty, treat the certified value as a 
normally distributed random variable with mean x and standard deviation U95%(x)/2 [2–4].  The measurand is the total 
mass fraction for ash listed in Table 2.  Metrological traceability is to the SI derived unit for mass fraction (expressed 
as grams per 100 grams).

Reference Mass Fraction Values for Elements:  Each reference mass fraction value is the mean from each set of 
analyses by NIST.  Values are expressed as x ± U95%(x), where x is the reference value and U95%(x) is the expanded 
uncertainty of the value.  The method-specific value of the analyte is believed to lie within the interval x ± U95%(x) 
with about a 95 % confidence [2–4].  The measurand is the mass  fraction for each element listed in Table 3, on a 
dry-mass basis, as determined by the method indicated.  Metrological traceability is to the SI derived unit for mass 
fraction (expressed as either percent or milligrams per kilogram) as realized by the method used.
