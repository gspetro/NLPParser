Standard  Reference  Material  1223 

Chromium  Steel 

(In  Cooperation  with  the  American  Society  for  Testing  and  Materials) 

This  Standard  Reference  Material  (SRM)  is  in  the  form  of  a  disk,  approximately  32  mm  (1  1/4  in)  in  diameter  and 
19  mm  (3/4  in)  thick.  The  SRM  is  intended  for  use  in  calibrating  optical  emission  and  x-ray  spectrometric  methods 
of  analysis.

>The  estimated  uncertainty  listed  for  a  constituent  is  based  on  judgment  and  represents  an  evaluation  of  the  combined 
effects  of  method  imprecision,  possible  systematic  errors  among  methods,  and  material  variability.  (No  attempt  was 
made  to  derive  exact  statistical  measures  of  imprecision  because  several  methods  were  involved  in  the  analysis  of 
most  constituents.)

This  Certificate  of Analysis  has  undergone  editorial  revision  to  reflect  program  and  organizational  changes  at  NIST 
and  at  the  Department  of Commerce.  No  attempt  was  made  to  reevaluate  the  certificate  values  or  any  technical  data 
presented  on  this  certificate. 

Homogeneity  testing  was  performed  at  NIST  by  optical  emission  spectrometric  analysis  by  J.A.  Norris,  B.I. 
Diamondstone,  and  T.W.  Vetter  of  the  NIST  Inorganic  Analytical  research  Division  and  by  R.K.  Bell,  ASTM-NIST 
Research  Associate  Program. 

The  technical  and  support  aspects  involved  in  the  original  preparation,  certification,  and  issuance  of  this  SRM  were 
coordinated  through  the  Standard  Reference  Materials  Program  by  W.P.  Reed.
