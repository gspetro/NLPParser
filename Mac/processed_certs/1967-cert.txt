Standard  Reference  Material  1967 

High-Purity  Platinum  Thermoelement 

Pt-67 

This  Standard  Reference  Material  (SRM)  is  a  high-purity  (99.999  +  wt.%)  platinum  wire,  0.51  mm  diameter  and 
1  meter  long,  that  has  been  prepared  for  use  as  the  standard  reference  thermoelement  for  calibration  of  base-metal 
and  noble-metal  thermocouple  materials  in  the  temperature  range  -197  to  1768  °C.  Standardized  thermoelectric 
values  for  these  applications,  based  on  the  International  Temperature  Scale  of  1990  (ITS-90)[1],  are  given  in  NIST 
Monograph  175[2].  This  material,  Pt-67,  replaces  the  former  thermoelectric  standard,  Pt-27,  which  was  used  from 
1922  to  1973.  Selected  portions  of  Pt-67  are  used  by  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology  (NIST) 
and  other  national  laboratories  for  calibration  of  thermocouple  materials.

Extensive  homogeneity  testing  was  performed  by  NIST,  as  well  as  by  five  cooperating  laboratories:  Engelhard 
Johnson,  Matthey  &  Co.,  Ltd.;  RCA  Laboratories;  and  Sigmund  Cohn  Corp.  A 
Industries,  Inc.; 
combination  of  the  following  methods  was  used:  chemical  analysis  techniques  included  optical  emission  and  spark 
source  mass  spectrography,  polarography,  spectrophotometry,  activation  analysis,  and  vacuum  fusion;  and  electri- 
cal  measurements  included  thermoelectric,  temperature  coefficient  of  resistivity,  and  residual  resistance  ratio. 
The  material  is  homogeneous  within  the  limits  of  precision  of  most  of  these  methods. 

The  original  coordination  and  evaluation  of  data  leading  to  certification  of  SRM  1967  was  performed  at  NIST  by 
R.  L.  Powell,  (ret.)  J.  G.  Hust,  (ret.)  L.  L.  Sparks  of  the  Chemical  Engineering  Science  Division  (Boulder)  and 
G.  W.  Burns  of  the  Chemical  Process  Metrology  Division  (Gaithersburg). 

The  technical  and  support  aspects  involved  in  the  revision,  update  and  issuance  of  this  Standard  Reference  Material 
were  coordinated  through  the  Standard  Reference  Materials  Program  by  J.  C.  Colbert.  The  original  coordination 
of  certification  efforts  was  performed  by  R.  E.  Michaelis.

Supplementary  Information 

The  effect  of  impurities  at  temperatures  above  1200  °C  are  discussed  in  a  Special  Publication  [3]  that  describes 
this  material,  its  preparation,  characterization,  and  properties.  This  publication  also  provides  a  history  of  the 
development  of  this  thermoelectric  standard  (Pt-67).  Pt-67  (SRM  1967)  is  a  selected,  highly  homogeneous  portion 
of  SRM  680  that  was  prepared  by  Sigmund  Cohn  Corp.  by  induction  melting  of  high-purity  platinum  sponge  in  a 
zirconium  silicate  crucible,  and  by  casting  into  a  platinum-lined,  water-cooled  copper  mold. 
The  ingot  was 
trimmed,  swaged,  and  drawn  into  0.51  mm  diameter  wire  using  the  utmost  precautions  to  minimize  contamination. 

For  a  reference  junction  at  0  °C,  the  difference  between  the  thermoelectric  voltages  of  Pt-67  and  Pt-27  can  be 
approximated  by 

where  AE  is  expressed  in  microvolts  and  t99  in  degrees  Celsius  (ITS-90).  This  relation  was  found  to  be  valid  from 
-197  to  1200  °C.  The  temperature  coefficicent  of  electrical  resistance  between  0  and  100  °C, 

was  found  to  be  3.9269  (+0.0012)  x  10°7/  °C. 
electrical  resistance  at  the  ice  point  and 

at  the  boiling  point  of  helium, 

The  residual  resistance  ratio,  determined  from  the  specimen’s 

was  found  to  vary  smoothly  along  the  length  of  the  wire  from  a  value  of  3407  to  3678.  The  average  value  is  3480. 

Proper  usage  of  this  SRM  requires  careful  annealing  and  handling  techniques.  The  recommended  procedures 
are: 

1)  Clean  with  ethanol  and  air  dry. 
2)  Suspend  the  wire  in  a  clean,  dust-free  enclosure  and  connect  to  a  current  source, 
3)  Continuously  increase  the  current  until  the  wire  is  at  about  1200  °C. 
4)  Maintain  this  temperature  for  10  minutes. 
5)  Slowly  decrease  the  current  until  the  temperature  of  the  wire  is  just  below  incandescence,  hold  for  60  minutes 

and  slowly  cool  to  room  temperature. 

6)  Care  should  be  taken  at  all  times  to  avoid  unnecessary  mechanical  stresses  of  the  wire.  If  the  platinum  is  to  be 

used  at  high  temperatures,  use  special  gloves  or  paper  padding  while  handling. 

7)  High-purity  sintered  alumina  tubing  is  recommended  for  insulating  and  protecting  the  platinum  wire  during  use  at 

high  temperatures.  After  assembling  the  wire  in  an  insulating  tube,  reanneal  the  assembly  in  a  furnace  for  60  minutes 
at  1100  °C,  followed  by  cooling  to  450  °C.  The  assembly  should  be  maintained  at  450  °C  for  12  hours  and  then  cooled 
to  room  temperature.
