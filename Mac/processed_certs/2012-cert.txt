Material Description(1):  The SRMs were selected from a series of 25 type-p, B-doped, 200 mm Czochralski (CZ) Si 
wafers manufactured by ShinEtsu, SEH America, Vancouver, WA.  A nominal 25 nm Si surface layer was deposited 
on  each  wafer,  capping  a  strained,  epitaxial,  nominal  50 nm  Si0.85Ge0.15  thin  film  on  one  of  the  polished  substrate 
surfaces (referred to as the “front” surface) using a Centura RP Epi deposition system by the applications lab at Applied 
Materials.    HRXRD  measurements  were  performed  on  24 areas  (4 rows  ×  6 columns)  within  a  150 mm  ×  100 mm 
rectangle on each wafer.  Each wafer has four quadrant scribe lines at the edges indicating the (110) crystal orientation 
directions.  These scribe lines provide a more accurate orientation reference than the wafer notch.  The wafer notch is 
taken as  = 0 rad for miscut orientation referencing.  (Note that the central 150 mm × 100 mm is the region for which 
the certified values listed in Table 1 are applicable.)

MEASUREMENT PROCEDURE 
 
D-spacing  and  Bragg  angle  measurements:    The  NIST  approach  for  establishing  SI  traceability  in  HRXRD 
measurements  uses a Si reference crystal of known d-spacing and compares it to the wafer feedstock values by a 
difference method to eliminate significant uncertainties arising from a number of systematic errors.  The reference 
crystal used in this study was cut from a piece of the WASO 04 boule of silicon grown for the Avogadro Project, 
and  polished  to  a  strain-free  450 μm  thickness  lamella  as  discussed  in  reference 5.    The  (220) lattice  spacing  has 
been determined with a combined relative standard uncertainty of uc(ΔdWASO04)/dWASO04 ≤ 610–8 by the d lattice 
comparator  at  NIST [6–9].    This  reference  crystal  was  measured  after  system  alignment  changes  so  that  wafer 
feedstock  and  reference  crystal  measurements  could  be  paired  only  for  identical  system  configurations.    The 
following iterative measurement and analysis approach was followed: 
1.  Align HRXRD instrument (see alignment methods [10–14]), 
2.  Measure Si reference crystal with HRXRD instrument, 
3.  Measure Si wafer feedstock with HRXRD instrument at all sample positions, and 
4.  Use reference data to provide SI traceability for wafer measurements.  

Interpretation of a single diffraction measurement on an HRXRD instrument requires substantial knowledge about 
instrument  alignment  and  goniometer  orientation.    One  way  to  eliminate  some  of  the  uncertainty  resulting  from 
measuring  instrument-related  parameters  is  to  measure  two  diffraction  features  from  the  same  family  of  planes, 
ideally the non-dispersive and dispersive settings of the same planes and approximately the same d-spacing of the 
planes used in the instrument’s monochromator.  (For a treatment of dynamical diffraction theory, see references 15 
and 16.)  Our approach uses the (220) family to provide information on the Si substrate d-spacing.  The Bragg angle, 
θB(220),  can  be  accurately  determined  by  measuring  the  angles  of  the  diffraction  peak  in  each  of  the  crystal’s  two 
settings.    The angle between  the  diffracting  conditions for  the  sample  will  be  equal  to  2θB(220),  since  a  diffraction 
peak is observed at both plus, (220)+, and minus, (220)–, the Bragg angle from a [100]-faceted Si crystal.

This approach to measuring d-spacing is commonly known as the Bond method [17–21].  This method is typically 
used in a reflection geometry, in which corrections for index of refraction and many other effects are necessary [22].  
In  contrast,  the  reference  crystal  and  SRM  wafer  measurements  have  been  taken  in  a  transmission  geometry  to 
eliminate  uncertainties  related  to  these  corrections.   The  impact  of  wafer  radius-of-curvature  and strain  effects  on 
d-spacing  determination  is  largely  unexplored [23–25],  but  such  effects  should  affect  both  certification 
measurements and subsequent measurements similarly. 
 
Each 200 mm wafer was measured at the 24 central points of the SRM specimens.  At each point, or sample position, a 
step-scan  was  taken  for  both  the  non-dispersive  and  dispersive  Si (220)  transmission  peaks  and  for  the  Si (004) 
reflection peak from the Si substrate bulk.  A longer angular range scan of the Si (004) and Si1-xGex (004) reflection 
peaks was made to measure properties of the epitaxial surface structure.  Table 3 provides the details of these scans.  
This sequence of scans was performed at least twice at each of the 24 points.

Miscut  Measurements:    The  measurements  used  for  the  certification  of  dSRM  were  collected  with  the  wafer  notch 
facing  up,  = 0 rad.    The  wafers  were  then  rotated  to  = /2 rad,   rad,  and  3/2 rad  orientations.    At  least  two 
reflection (004)  scans  were  collected  at  each  azimuthal  orientation  to  determine  θ.    Equations 2  and 3  show  the 
calculations used for determining two miscut components, xSRM and ySRM, providing the angles between the polished 
wafer surface and the Si crystal planes.  The geometry of each of the miscut angles is provided in Figure 2.

CERTIFICATION ANALYSIS 
 
Calculating  Si  (220)  transmission  d-spacing:    With  the  effective  wavelength  known  for  each  alignment  of  the 
system,  calculating  the  d-spacing  simply  requires  applying  Bragg’s  law  to  pairs  of  dispersive  and  non-dispersive 
peak positions.  A small correction for temperature is also required with which a small uncertainty, uc(ΔTd) = 32 am, 
is associated.  These statistical calculations were performed in Python [26], R [27], and DATAPLOT [28] and then 
independently verified by the NIST Statistical Engineering Division (SED) using DATAPLOT. 
 
Type A statistical uncertainty:  The measured d-spacing for each SRM 2012 specimen varies because of statistical 
variation  (from  both  instrument  repeatability  and  sample  d-spacing  distribution)  as  well  as  systematic  variation 
arising  from  the  sample  position  on  the  CDPBD  wafer  holder.    Because  of  the  systematic  nature  of  the  variation 
with  sample  holder  position,  it  was  judged  inappropriate  to  include  this  variation  in  the  Type A  statistical 
uncertainty  (k = 1),  ui(dSRM).    One-way  ANOVA  was  therefore  used  to  separate  the  statistical  variation  from  the 
systematic component by generating a correction to d-spacing based on sample position.  The estimate of dSRM is 
then the mean of the set of estimates, and ui(dSRM) = 0.24 fm is determined as the residual standard deviation of the 
ANOVA model (that is, the variance not explained by the wafer holder position correction). 
 
Type B systematic uncertainty related to misalignment:  The only error relating to alignment that has a significant 
impact  on  the  uncertainties  for  dSRM  is  the  relative  misalignment  of  the  SRM  feedstock  and  the  reference 
crystal, Δδ2.    Such  misalignment  may  cause  a  systematic  error  because  the  wafers  and  the  reference  crystals  are 
mounted  differently.    Therefore,  based  on  a  study  of  misalignment  effects,  we  assign  a  large  maximum  offset  to 
d-spacing of Δδ2d ≤ 0.62 fm and so a standard uncertainty (k = 1) of uj(Δδ2d) = 0.36 fm. 
 
Best  estimate  and  combined  standard  uncertainty:    The  best  estimate  of  the  Si (220)  substrate  d-spacing  of  the 
SRM 2012  feedstock  measured  in  transmission  is  dSRM = 0.192 016 1 nm.    The  combined  standard  uncertainty 
(k = 1) of the SRM 2012 d-spacing is the combination of the statistical uncertainty computed above, the uncertainty 
of the misalignment difference between the SRM and the reference crystal, the temperature uncertainty in measuring 
the specimens, and the uncertainty in the reference crystal d-spacing from reference 5, uc(dWASO04) = 12.1 am.

Thus  the  standard  uncertainty  (k = 1),  uc(dSRM) = 0.43 fm.    Expressed  as  a  relative  standard  uncertainty  (k = 1), 
uc(dSRM)/dSRM = 2.2  10–6.  The expanded uncertainty (k = 2) is U(dSRM) = 0.87 fm. 
 
Calculating surface-to-crystal-plane miscut best estimates and combined standard uncertainty:  The estimates used 
for the certified values are the means over all of the wafers, and the type A standard uncertainties are their estimated 
standard deviations over that set.  Their values are given in Table 5. 
 
Calculating  Bragg  angle  of  Si (004)  reflection  best  estimate  and  combined  standard  uncertainty:   Because  of  the 
effects  of  material  index  of  refraction,  wafer  curvature,  vertical  divergence,  long-range  goniometer  angle 
uncertainties,  and  other  systematic  corrections  to  reflection  Bragg  angle,  certification  of  the  d-spacing  of  the 
substrate in reflection condition is not possible at this time.  Instead, to provide a traceable parameter for a reflection 
condition measurement of the SRM, we use the uncorrected Bragg angle of the Si (004) reflection diffraction peak 
from  the  surface  of  the  wafer.    This  quantity  can  be  calculated  from  the  Bragg  angle  of  the  Si (004)  reflection, 
θB,SRM (004), corrected for the miscut of the surface relative to the crystal planes (see Equation 7). 

 

 

 

Since only one Si (004) reflection case peak could be measured, to determine the uncorrected Bragg angle of the 
reflection requires knowledge of the angle of the diffracting planes of the crystal, Δθ0 (see Equation 8).  

This is known in this case from the positions of the dispersive and non-dispersive transmission peaks (used in the 
d-spacing calculation of Equation 1).

The  Bragg  angle  of  the  Si  (004)  reflection  was  estimated  for  each  sample  position  for  each  wafer;  the  mean  and 
estimated standard deviation of this set are given in Table 6.  Since temperature correction for d-spacing variation

cannot  be  applied  directly  to  angle,  an  additional  uncertainty  (k = 1),  ui(ΔTθB,SRM (004)) = 0.50 μrad,  due  to 
temperature variation over the course of the measurements must be incorporated.  An uncertainty must be added due 
to long-range error of the goniometer, uj(ωSRM) = 3.9 μrad at this angle.  Finally, a correction for the uncertainty in 
NIST monochromator wavelength, λSRM (see Table 7), and its corresponding contribution to the uncertainty of the 
Bragg  angle  (k = 1),  ui(λmonoθB,SRM (004)) = 7.3 rad,  must  be  included.    The  resulting  combined  standard  uncertainty

SI TRACEABILITY 
 
Uncertainty  analyses  performed  for  this  SRM  follow  the  ISO  Guide  to  the  Expression  of  Uncertainty  in 
Measurement [2].  Figure 5 shows the SI traceability pathway for Si (220) d-spacing determination using SI-defined 
units  of  time,  t,  and  distance,  m,  as  input  parameters [1,3,4].    This  diagram  illustrates  the  flow  of  SI  units,  the 
essential prior SI-traceable measurements, and the measured feedstock and material properties in an unbroken chain, 
as required for computing the total uncertainty budget in a given measurement.  Three different feedstock Si boules 
and corresponding Si (220) d-spacings were used in the traceability chain for this SRM; (1) a purpose-commissioned 
boule of Si known as the WASO 4.2 feedstock provided the direct link to the SI through optical frequency via its use 
as  the  X-ray  interferometer  in  the  X-ray  /  optical  interferometer  at  Physikalisch-Technische  Bundesanstalt  (PTB, 
Braunschweig,  Germany) [5];  (2) a  purpose-commissioned  boule  of  Si  used  in  the  Avogadro  Project,  known  as 
WASO 04 feedstock, provided reference artifacts for internal calibration of the NIST CDPBD instrument through 
direct  comparison  with  WASO 4.2  on  the  NIST  lattice  comparator [29];  (3) a  set  of  epitaxially-coated  wafers 
sectioned  from  a  single  commercial  CZ  boule  of  Si,  known  as  SRM 2012  feedstock,  are  the  certified  artifacts 
measured on the CDPBD by comparison with WASO 04.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
Handling and Storage 
The epitaxial layer can be damaged or the wafer strained mechanically; therefore contact with the front surface of the 
SRM  wafer  should  be  avoided.    To  remove  surface  contamination,  use  filtered  nitrogen  gas,  or  instrument-vendor 
wafer cleaning protocol. 
 
Peak  profiles:  The  measured  diffraction  peaks  were  significantly  asymmetric.    Supporting  measurements  suggest 
that  this  asymmetry  may  not  be  entirely  due  to  instrument  effects,  but  may  be  in  part  due  to  properties  of  the 
SRM 2012 feedstock.  Therefore, a split-Pearson VII profile was used for fitting and estimating peak positions and 
is  recommended  for  determining  peak  positions  for  calibration.    Use  of  another  profile  function  may  result  in 
systematic bias due to differing effects of asymmetry on profile position determination. 
 
Use 
Suggested use of d-spacing measured in Si (220) transmission:  Calibration by direct use of the certified d-spacing, 
dSRM requires an instrument that can measure in transmission geometry.  If this is possible, one can calibrate either 
the  instrument  monochromator’s  wavelength,  λinst,  or  angle  measurements  near  the  Si (220)  reflection  (in 
transmission geometry), Δθinst.  The following procedure provides an approach for this calibration (see Table 3 for 
scan ranges).  Individual instrument manufacturers may have alternative suggested procedures. 

1.  Clean wafer holder and SRM with filtered nitrogen prior to mounting. 
2.  Mount SRM in holder with wafer notch upright and scribe marks facing away from source. 
3.  Locate non-dispersive Si (220) peak center, , using a setup scan. 
4.  Perform  non-dispersive  Si  (220)  normal  range  scan  to  measure  peaks’  full  width  at  half  maximum 

(FWHM). 

5.  Re-align wafer azimuth and repeat (4) until minimum FWHM is achieved. 
6.  Locate dispersive Si (220) peak center, , using a setup scan. 
7.  Perform dispersive Si (220) normal range scan to measure FWHM. 
8.  Locate Si (004) reflection peak center, ω, using a setup scan. 
9.  Perform a series of Si (004) reflection normal range scans at various wafer tilts, δ2 – defined as χ tilt on 

most instruments.

10.  Set δ2 for wafer based on Si (004) reflection FWHM minimum.  
11.  Measure non-dispersive Si (220) HRXRD data.  
12.  Measure dispersive Si (220) HRXRD data.  
13.  Repeat steps 11 and 12. 
14.  Use difference of step 13 to determine θinst(220). 
15.  Use θinst(220) and dSRM to calibrate either λinst or Δθinst. 

 
Suggested use of surface-to-crystal-plane miscut:  The miscut certification will allow calibration and repeatability 
studies for rotating sample holders in commercial instruments in the field.  By repeating miscut measurements on 
the  SRM,  one  can  test  the  repeatability  and  stability  of  a  sample  holder  during  rotation  and  remounting.    The 
following procedure provides an approach for this sample holder calibration.  Individual instrument manufacturers 
may have alternative suggested procedures. 

1.  Clean wafer holder and SRM with filtered nitrogen prior to mounting. 
2.  Mount SRM in holder with wafer notch upright and scribe marks facing away from source. 
3.  Measure Si (004) reflection HRXRD data at  = 0 rad. 
4.  Rotate sample to  = π/2 rad and measure Si (004) HRXRD data. 
5.  Rotate sample to  = π rad and measure Si (004) HRXRD data. 
6.  Rotate sample to  = 3π/2 rad and measure Si (004) HRXRD data. 
7.  Calculate xinst using equation 2 and data from steps 4 and 6. 
8.  Calculate yinst using equation 3 and data from steps 3 and 5. 
9.  Calculate ξinst and inst using equations 4 and 5. 
10.  Compare values, ξinst and inst, with certified values ξSRM and SRM. 
11.  Use comparison data to align wafer holder. 
12.  Repeat steps 1 through 11 several times to reduce statistical uncertainty terms. 

 
Suggested use of Bragg angle of Si (004) reflection:  If transmission measurements are not possible, one can use the 
uncorrected  Bragg  angle  of  the  Si (004)  reflection,  θB,inst(004),  for  calibration  of  either  the  instrument 
monochromator’s  wavelength,  λinst  or  angle  measurements  near  the  Si (004)  reflection  (in  reflection  geometry), 
Δθinst.  The following relational formula uses Bragg’s law to relate the SRM and instrument parameters and may be 
used to solve for either quantity of interest using equation 7:

(10) 

The following procedure provides an approach for this type of calibration.  Additional uncertainties may result from 
differences  in  beam  conditioning  optics.    Individual  instrument  manufacturers  may  have  alternative  suggested 
procedures. 

1.  Perform surface-to-crystal-plane misalignment calibration procedure. 
2.  Remount SRM in holder with serial number upright and facing sample holder. 
3.  Perform  specular  reflection  alignment  to  determine  specimen  surface  orientation  with  respect  to  the 

instrument plane. 

4.  Reset instrument  zero to the wafer surface. 
5.  Measure Si (004) reflection HRXRD data at  = 0 rad. 
6.  Use measured θsurface,inst(004) and θsurface,SRM(004) to calibrate either λinst or Δθinst. 
7.  Repeat steps 2 through 5 several times to reduce the uncertainty in statistical mounting errors. 

 
The procedures for aligning the specular reflection will introduce significant uncertainties that must be included in 
any uncertainty budget for use of the certified values.
