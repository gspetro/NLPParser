Certificate of Analysis 
 
Standard Reference Material 918c 
 
Potassium Chloride General and Ion Activity Standard 
 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended for use as an analytical standard of known purity.  It is intended 
primarily  for  use  in  the  calibration  and  standardization  of  procedures  for  potassium (K)  and  chloride (Cl‾) 
determinations employed in clinical analysis, including those using ion-selective electrodes, and for routine critical 
evaluation of the daily working standards used in these procedures.  This lot of potassium chloride (KCl) was prepared 
to ensure a material of high purity and homogeneity and has been assayed after heating at 110 °C to 120 °C.  A unit 
of SRM 918c consists of a single glass bottle containing 30 g of the material. 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values:  Table 1 lists the certified values for this SRM, expressed as mass fractions, w, of 
KCl, K, and Cl‾.  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that 
all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [1].  A certified value is the present 
best  estimate  of  the  true  value.    The  expanded  uncertainty,  U,  is  calculated  as  U = kuc,  where  uc  is  the  combined 
standard uncertainty calculated according to the ISO/JCGM Guide and its Supplement 1 [2,3].  The value of uc is 
intended to represent, at the level of one standard deviation, the combined effect of inherent sources of uncertainty of 
the assay techniques, material heterogeneity, and applicable corrections for interfering trace elements.  The respective 
values  of  the  coverage  factor,  k,  for  each  measurand  in  Table 1  correspond  to  an  approximately  95 %  level  of 
confidence for the effective degrees of freedom, νeff, stated for the given measurand. 
 
Reference  Mass  Fraction  Values:    Table 2  lists  reference  values  for  the  mass  fraction  of  bromine (Br)  and  for 
alkalinity, expressed as potassium hydroxide (KOH).  A reference value is a best estimate of the true value; however, 
the value does not meet NIST criteria for certification and is provided with an associated uncertainty that may reflect 
only measurement precision and may not include all other sources of uncertainty [1]. 
 
Information Mass Fraction Values:  Table 4 lists information values for trace elements.  Information values are 
non-certified values that may be of interest and use to the SRM user, but insufficient information is available to provide 
an uncertainty associated with the value [1].  The information values are given to provide additional characterization 
of the material only.  These values should not be used to monitor or assess analytical performance.  Information values 
cannot be used to establish metrological traceability. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 918c is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until  01 October 2035,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  given  in  this 
certificate (see “Instructions for Storage and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, 
or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM lot over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical changes occur that affect the certification before the expiration of this certificate, NIST will notify the purchaser.  
Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Coordination of the technical measurements leading to the certification of SRM 918c was provided by K.W. Pratt of 
the NIST Chemical Sciences Division.

Analytical measurements leading to the certification of SRM 918c were made by K.W. Pratt, J.R. Sieber, T.W. Vetter, 
and J.F. Waters of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division. 
 
Statistical analyses were performed by W.F. Guthrie of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division. 
 
Office  of  Reference
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Office  of  Reference 
Materials. 
 
Calculation of Certified Values: The certified value for wKCl is obtained by combining the results of independent 
coulometric and gravimetric analyses using the DerSimonian-Laird procedure [4].  Prior to computing the certified 
value, the results from the coulometric and gravimetric analyses were corrected for the following impurities: aluminum 
oxide (Al2O3),  calcium  chloride (CaCl2),  potassium  bromide (KBr),  potassium 
fluoride (KF),  potassium 
hydroxide (KOH),  potassium  sulfate (K2SO4),  rubidium  chloride (RbCl),  silicon  dioxide (SiO2),  and  sodium 
chloride (NaCl).  The certified value for wK is obtained by combining the direct result of the gravimetric analyses, 
corrected for the Al2O3, CaCl2, NaCl, RbCl, and SiO2 impurities; and the indirect wK, calculated from the coulometric 
wKCl and the additional K from the KBr, KF, KOH, and K2SO4 impurities.  The corrected values are combined using 
the  DerSimonian-Laird  procedure.    The  certified  value  for  wCl  is  obtained  by  combining  the  direct  result  of  the 
coulometric analyses, corrected for interfering Br‾; and the indirect wCl, calculated from the gravimetric wKCl and the 
additional  Cl‾  from  the  CaCl2,  NaCl,  and  RbCl  impurities.    The  corrected  values  are  combined  using  the 
DerSimonian-Laird  procedure [4].    The  corrections  were  obtained  from  the  trace  element  determinations  and  the 
appropriate gravimetric factors [5].  A portion of the K is present in SRM 918c as KBr, KF, KOH, and K2SO4; and a 
portion of the chloride is present as CaCl2, NaCl, and RbCl.  Hence, the sum of the certified values for wK and wCl 
does  not  equal  the  certified  value  for  wKCl.    The  certified  values  for  the  mass  fractions  of  K,  Cl,  and  KCl  are 
metrologically traceable to the SI units for mass, current, and time in the coulometric assay; to the SI unit for mass in 
the gravimetric assay; and to the derived SI unit kilogram per kilogram for mass fraction (expressed as a percent) for 
the corrections for trace elements.

Calculation of Reference Values:  The reference value, the measurand, for bromine (Br) is the mass fraction of Br 
as  determined  by  wavelength-dispersive  X-ray  fluorescence  analysis (WDXRF).    The  Br  reference  value  is 
metrologically traceable to the derived SI unit kilogram per kilogram for mass fraction (expressed as micrograms per 
gram).  The reference value, the measurand, for alkalinity (expressed as a mass fraction of KOH) was determined by 
pH measurements in a carbon dioxide-free 1.0 mol/L solution of dried SRM 918c.  The reference value for the mass 
fraction of KOH is metrologically traceable to the quantity pH, to the primary measurement of pH, and to the SI unit 
for mass.  The expanded uncertainty is calculated using k = 2.

In  Equation 1,  lg = log10;  I  is  the  ionic  strength  (identical  to  b  for  KCl  solutions);  A  and  B  are  the  Debye-Hückel 
constants [6]; and β, C, and D are conventional constants specific to KCl [6].  The numerical values of these constants

at 25 °C are: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
These constants are valid at molalities of KCl from 0 mol/kg to 4.8 mol/kg (saturation).  For b < 0.1 mol/kg, the terms 
in Equation 1 containing β, C, and D may be neglected in the calculation.

The value of lg γ± at temperatures from 15 °C to 45 °C and at any molality of KCl from 0 mol/kg to 0.1 mol/kg may 
be obtained by using Equation 1 and temperature-dependent values of A and B calculated from Equations 2a and 2b,

The values for pK and pCl may then be calculated from lg γ± using the procedure described in reference 7 and osmotic 
coefficients for water given in reference 8. 
 
Reference Values for pK and pCl:  Table 5 lists reference values and associated uncertainties [6] for pK and pCl, 
where p denotes –lg, pK = paK, and pCl = paCl.  The coverage factors and expanded uncertainties in Table 5 apply 
both to pK and to pCl.  The pK and pCl values in Table 5 are metrologically traceable to the theoretical model used 
for the calculations (see above) and to the certified mass fractions of K and Cl in SRM 918c.

Instructions for gravimetric preparation of the solutions in Tables 4 and 5 are presented below (see “Preparation of 
SRM 918c Solutions of Specified Molalities”). 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE AND USE 
 
Storage:  This SRM should be stored in its original bottle under normal laboratory conditions. 
 
Use:  Before it is sampled, the unit should be thoroughly mixed by carefully inverting and rotating the tightly sealed 
bottle.  A minimum test portion mass of 200 mg should be used for analytical determinations.  The bottle must be 
tightly re-capped after use and protected from moisture. 
 
Drying  Instructions:   Dry  the  material  for  4 h  at 110 °C  to 120 °C.   After  the  SRM has been  dried,  store  it  in  a 
desiccator over anhydrous magnesium perchlorate. 
 
Preparation  of  SRM 918c  Solutions  of  Specified  Molalities:    The  gravimetric  procedures  in  this  section  yield 
solutions  with  the  molalities  specified  in  Tables 4  and  5.    The  relative  standard  uncertainties  specified  for  the 
weighings are selected such that the corresponding uncertainty in pK or pCl is negligible compared with the inherent 
uncertainty of the model used to calculate pK or pCl.  The gravimetric factors are presented to six significant figures, 
to permit more accurate preparations where required for other applications.  The target gravimetric factors given in 
Table 6 for SRM 918c yield molalities of K and Cl, bK and bCl, that differ from the nominal value by less than six 
parts per million, relative. 
 
Prepare these solutions following the instructions below and using the values in Table 6. 
 
Quantities denoted by m′ and associated gravimetric factors in this section include the effect of air buoyancy, i.e., they 
correspond  to the balance  indication  in  units  of  mass  obtained  in  the  laboratory (the  “balance  reading”),  and  they 
incorporate the certified values of wK and wCl in SRM 918c.

(a) Unless otherwise noted, nominal mass of solution is 200 g. 
(b) Nominal mass of solution is 400 g. 

 

Locate the molality of the desired solution in the first column of Table 6, the corresponding nominal mass of SRM 918c 
in  the  second  column,  and  the  corresponding  gravimetric  factor  (GF)  in  the  third  column.   Weigh  by  difference  the 
nominal (± 10 %) mass of dried (see above) SRM 918c, to a relative standard uncertainty of 0.1 %, into a clean, dry 
polyethylene bottle.  For those solutions in Table 6 with bKCl > 0.01 mol/kg, use a 250 mL bottle.  For the solution with 
bKCl = 0.01 mol/kg, use a 500 mL bottle.  Multiply the exact delivered mass of SRM 918c, m′918c, by the corresponding 
gravimetric factor given in the third column to obtain the exact mass of water, m′H2O, to add to the bottle.  Add this mass 
of deionized water, weighed to a relative standard uncertainty of 0.1 %, to the bottle.  The most convenient method is to 
tare the bottle containing the added SRM 918c on the balance, add the bulk of the water from a beaker and the last few 
grams using an adjustable pipet or dropper with a narrow tip.  Cap the bottle and shake until the SRM 918c has totally 
dissolved.  Gravimetric preparation in this manner eliminates the need to weigh exactly predetermined masses of solid 
samples.    Proportionately  smaller  quantities  of  SRM 918c  and  water  may  be  used  in  the  preparations,  provided  that 
m′918c ≥ 200 mg. 
 
The solution with a molality of 0.001 mol/kg is prepared by serial dilution of the 0.01 mol/kg or 0.1 mol/kg solution.  To 
prepare it from the 0.01 mol/kg solution, add 20 g (nominal value, weighed to a relative standard uncertainty of 0.1 %) 
of the 0.01 mol/kg solution to a clean, dry 250 mL polyethylene bottle.  Multiply the exact mass of the 0.01 mol/kg 
solution  by  the  gravimetric  factor 8.9933.    Add  this  mass  of  water  to  the  same  bottle  and  mix.    To  prepare  the 
0.001 mol/kg solution from the 0.1 mol/kg solution, the corresponding approximate mass and gravimetric factor are 2.0 g 
(weighed to an accuracy of 0.1 mg) and 98.267, respectively.  For either dilution, the mass of the concentrated solution 
may be varied within the limits set by the amount of available solution, bottle capacity, and resolution of the balances 
used. 
 
SOURCE, HOMOGENEITY, AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Source  of  Material:    The  KCl  used  for  this  SRM  was  obtained  from  a  commercial  supplier.    The  material  was 
examined  for  compliance  with  the  specification  for  reagent  grade  KCl  as  specified  by  the  American  Chemical 
Society [9].  The material was found to meet or exceed the minimum requirements in every respect. 
 
Homogeneity:  This SRM is homogeneous within the uncertainty limits for the nominal sample mass, 200 mg, used 
for  the  coulometric  chloride  assays.    Samples  less  than  200 mg  are  not  recommended  in  order  to  avoid  possible 
heterogeneity with smaller sample sizes. 
 
Assay  Techniques:    The  coulometric  assay  value  was  obtained  by  automated  titration [10]  with  coulometrically 
generated Ag+ using potentiometric detection of the endpoint.  The gravimetric assay value was obtained by converting 
test portions of SRM 918c material to K2SO4 (procedure based on reference 11).  Corrections for air buoyancy were 
made  using  a  density  of  1.984 g/cm3  for  SRM 918c.    Corrections  for  interfering  trace  contaminants  in  each 
determination were applied as described above. 
 

                     

(1) Certain  commercial  equipment,  instruments,  or  materials  are  identified  in  this  certificate  to  adequately  specify  the 
experimental procedure.  Such identification does not imply recommendation or endorsement by the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the purpose.

NOTICE TO USERS 
 
This SRM is for research use only. 
 
NIST encourages the use of its SRMs to establish metrological traceability for the user’s measurement results, and 
NIST strives to maintain the SRM inventory supply.  However, NIST cannot guarantee the continued or continuous 
supply of any specific SRM.  Accordingly, NIST encourages the use of SRMs as primary benchmarks for the quality 
and accuracy of the user’s in-house (working) standards.  As such, SRMs should be used to validate or otherwise 
assign values to the more routinely used standards in a laboratory.  When the metrologically traceable values of such 
standards  are assigned  using  this SRM  for calibration,  the  uncertainties assigned  to  those values  must  include  the 
uncertainty  of  the  certified  value  of  this  SRM,  appropriately  combined  with  the  uncertainties  of  the  calibration 
measurements  for  the  in-house  standard.    Comparisons  between  NIST  SRMs  and  such  working  measurement 
standards should take place at intervals appropriate to the conservation of the SRM primary standard and the stability 
of relevant in-house standards.  For further guidance on how this approach can be implemented, contact NIST by 
email at srms@nist.gov. 
 
Possible Interfering Species:  It is the responsibility of the user to evaluate which species may interfere with the 
application  of  this  SRM  and  to  apply  any  necessary  corrections  that  affect  the  given  application.    The  values  in 
Tables 2 and 3 may be useful in this evaluation.
