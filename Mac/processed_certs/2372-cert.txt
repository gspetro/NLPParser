Human DNA Quantitation Standard 

in 

hydrochloride (Tris HCl) 

10 mmol/L 2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol 

 
Standard  Reference  Material (SRM) 2372  is  intended  primarily  for  use  in  the  value  assignment  of  human 
genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) forensic quantitation materials.  It is not intended for any human or animal 
clinical  diagnostic  use.    SRM 2372  consists  of  three  well-characterized  human  genomic  DNA  materials 
and 
solubilized 
0.1 mmol/L ethylenediaminetetraacetic  acid  disodium  salt (disodium  EDTA)  using  deionized  water  adjusted  to 
pH 8.0 buffer (TE-4).  The three component genomic DNA materials, labeled A, B, and C, are derived from a single 
male donor, multiple female donors, and multiple male and female donors, respectively.  A unit of the SRM consists 
of one sterile 2 mL vial of each component, each vial containing approximately 110 μL of DNA solution.  Each of 
these vials is labeled and is sealed with a color–coded screw cap. 
 
Certified  Values:    Table 1  lists  the  “apparent  absorbance,”  A260–320,  for  component  materials  diluted  with  an 
equal volume of 0.4 mol/L aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and measured against TE-4 mixed with an equal 
volume of 0.4 mol/L NaOH solution.  The A260–320 values are calculated as the decadic attenuance, D10, at 260 nm 
minus the D10 at 320 nm with an optical pathlength of 1.0 cm, spectral bandwidth of 1 nm, and a temperature of 
22 ºC  1 ºC.   The D10 values  are  indicated  by  the absorbance scale of  the spectrophotometer.    The D10 scale  is 
unitless.  Each apparent absorbance is expressed as a certified value  expanded uncertainty, where the expanded 
uncertainty  is  approximately  2.03 times  the  standard  uncertainty  and    is  consistent  with  the  ISO  and  NIST 
guides [1].    The  certified  value  expanded  uncertainty  specifies  an  interval  that  is  expected  to  include  the  true 
A260–320 value of an accurately prepared equal volume DNA/NaOH mixture with approximately a 95 % level of 
confidence for any given SRM 2372 vial [2].  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest 
confidence  in  its  accuracy  in  that  all  known  or  suspected  sources  of  bias  have  been  investigated  or  taken  into 
account [2].   The uncertainty  intervals are  estimated from  the  evaluation of  two  independent sets of 18 vials of 
each  component  mixed  with  an  equal  volume  of  0.4 mol/L  NaOH.    Treatment  with  NaOH  forces  the  DNA 
solutions to have a single-stranded conformation and enables conversion of the A260–320 values to a conventional 
estimate of DNA concentration [3].

Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 2372 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until 31 December 2017, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given in this 
certificate  (see  “Instructions  for  Storage  and  Use”).    The  certification  is  nullified  if  the  SRM  is  damaged, 
contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance  of  SRM  Certification:    NIST  will  monitor  this  SRM  over  the  period  of  its  certification.    If 
substantive  technical  changes  occur  that affect  the  certification before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST will 
notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification.

Information Values:  Table 2 lists the A260–320 values for the untreated components and an estimate of the DNA 
mass  concentration  of  the  SRM 2372  components  based  on  the  single–stranded  conformation.    These 
conventional concentration values are derived from the assertion that a solution of single–stranded DNA (ssDNA) 
with  an  absorbance  of  1.0  at  260 nm  and  a  pathlength  of  1.0 cm  has  a  DNA  mass  concentration  of  37 µg/mL 
(37 ng/µL) [4].  An information value is considered to be a value that will be of interest and use to the SRM user, 
but insufficient information is available to assess the uncertainty associated with the value or only a limited number 
of analyses were performed [2].

Coordination  of  the  technical  measurements  leading  to  this  certification  was  under  the  direction  of  M.C.  Kline 
and  J.M. Butler  of  the  NIST  Biomolecular  Measurement  Division.    Evaluation  of  the  data  was  performed  by 
D.L. Duewer  of  the  NIST  Chemical  Sciences  Division.    Evaluation  of  the  measurement  uncertainty  was 
performed by H-k. Liu of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division. 
  
Sample  preparation  and  analytical  measurements  were  by  NIST  Biomolecular  Measurement  Division  staff:  
M.C. Kline  and  J.W. Redman  prepared  the  samples;  M.C. Kline  made  the  D10  measurements  and  assessed  the 
NaOH  concentration  and  temperature  dependence  of  the  DNA/NaOH  mixtures;  and  E.L.R. Butts  evaluated  the 
performance  of  the  components  in  selected  quantitative  polymerase  chain  reaction (qPCR)  assays.    An 
interlaboratory study that assessed the commutability of the SRM among various qPCR assays was coordinated 
by M.C. Kline. 
 
Support aspects involved in the preparation and issuance of this SRM were coordinated through the NIST Office of 
Reference Materials. 
 
The preparation of this SRM was supported in part by the National Institute of Justice, U.S. Department of Justice. 
 
NOTICE AND WARNING TO USERS 

SRM 2372 IS A HUMAN-SOURCE MATERIAL.  SINCE THERE IS NO CONSENSUS ON THE INFECTIOUS 
STATUS  OF  EXTRACTED  DNA,  HANDLE  THE  SRM 2372  COMPONENTS  AS  BIOSAFETY  LEVEL 1 
MATERIALS  CAPABLE  OF  TRANSMITTING  INFECTIOUS  DISEASE [5].    SRM 2372  components  and 
derived solutions should be disposed of in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE AND USE 
 
Storage:  All vials of SRM 2372 should be stored in the dark between 2 °C to 8 °C.  DO NOT FREEZE. 
 
DO  NOT  EXPOSE  ANY  DNA  SOLUTION  TO  DIRECT  SUNLIGHT.    Component  vials  should  be  mixed 
briefly  and  centrifuged  (without  opening  the  vial  cap)  prior  to  removing  sample  aliquots  for  analysis.    For  the 
certified  and  informational  values  to  be  applicable,  materials  should  be  withdrawn  immediately  after  opening  the 
vials  and  processed  without  delay.    Certified  and  information  values  do  not  apply  to  any  material  remaining  in 
recapped  vials.    There  is  no  minimum  sample  size  requirement,  the  amount  required  by  any  given  assay  will  be 
dictated by the nature of the assay.   
 
For use with qPCR assays:  When used with qPCR assays, do not dilute the DNA materials with NaOH solution.  
Use  the  provided  information-value  concentrations  to  value  assign  secondary  standard  DNA  solutions  for  routine 
use.  Users may calibrate their assays to SRM 2372 using one or more dilution series, with each series prepared from 
one  SRM 2372  component.    For  non-gender-specific  qPCR  assays,  all  three  components  should  be  used  as 
calibrants to elucidate potential material-assay specific interactions.  Component C should NOT be used to calibrate 
gender-specific assays, since it is derived from a mixture of unknown proportions of male and female donors.  Users 
should  keep  in  mind  that  a  potential  for  pipetting  error  exists;  therefore,  suitable  care  should  be  exercised  in 
preparing calibration solutions.  See reference 6 for further information.   
 
For  use  with  spectrophotometric  assays:    Equal  volumes  of  a  DNA  material  and  a  freshly  prepared  0.4 mol/L 
NaOH  solution  should  be  combined,  mixed  briefly,  and  centrifuged  prior  to  measurement.    An  appropriate 

SRM 2372 

Page 2 of 5 

spectroscopic blank is prepared by mixing equal volumes of TE-4 and the 0.4 mol/L freshly prepared NaOH solution.  
The DNA/NaOH solutions are stable for at least 1 h.  Other dilution protocols may be used as required but they must 
yield  a  final  NaOH  concentration  of  approximately  0.2 mol/L.    Based  on  Annex B  of  ISO 21571 [1]  the 
conventional DNA concentration ([DNA]) of the samples is: 
 

[DNA] = F × (D10 at 260 nm – D10 at 320 nm) × 37 

where 
F 
D10 
37 

is the dilution factor and for equal-volume dilutions is equal to 2, 
is the spectrophotometric absorbance indication at the specified wavelength, 
is the conventional conversion factor for ssDNA as ng/µL or µg/mL. 

 
Figure 1 displays the average apparent absorbance spectra, D10 at 220 nm to 320 nm minus D10 at 320 nm, for the 
three SRM 2372 components.  The dashed lines are the spectra for the materials as delivered in the vials, referenced 
to TE-4, pH 8.0 buffer.  The solid lines are the spectra for the materials diluted with an equal volume of 0.4 mol/L 
NaOH, referenced to TE-4 diluted with an equal volume of 0.4 mol/L NaOH.

Note:    0.2 mol/L  NaOH  solutions  are  caustic.    It  may  be  more  appropriate  for  users  of  micro–volume 
spectrophotometers that do not isolate sample solutions in non–reactive optical chambers to evaluate the untreated 
materials and compare the results to the information A260–320 values. 
 
Spectroscopic  Traceability:    When  used  for  spectroscopic  value  assignment  of  secondary  DNA  quantitation 
standards, a research-quality dual-beam spectrophotometer must be used that can achieve a spectral bandwidth of 
1.0 nm  and  can  control  the  sample  temperature  at  22 ºC  1 ºC.    The  wavelength  calibration  of  the  instrument 
should be verified using a suitable holmium oxide solution standard [7].  The instrument must reliably measure 
A260–320  in  solutions  of  volume  0.1 mL  or  less.    This  capability  can  be  verified  using  a  suitable  absorption 
standard [8].    The  candidate  secondary  DNA  quantitation  standard(s)  must  be  prepared  in  TE–4.    In  dual–beam 
mode, optically matched cuvettes can be used to directly compare an unknown solution with a given SRM 2372 
component.    Indirect  comparisons  can  be  accomplished  with  the  buffer  that  was  used  to  prepare  the  candidate 
secondary standard(s) as the reference blank for both the SRM and candidate materials.

PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Components A and B:  Human buffy coats from anonymous donors were obtained from a commercial source.  The 
method  used  to  isolate  genomic  DNA  from  the  white  blood  cells  found  in  the  human  buffy  coats  is  based  on  a 
modified  “salting  out”  procedure [9].    After  the  initial  extraction,  the  material  was  re-extracted  to  assure  purity. 
Component A  was  treated  with  bovine  pancreatic  ribonuclease A  before  re-extraction [4].    Extracted  DNA  for 
components  A  and  B  was  air–dried  in  a  laminar  flow  hood  and  stored  in  perfluoroalkoxy  fluoropolymer (PFA) 
containers  at  4 °C  prior  to  solubilization  in  TE–4.    After  addition  of  buffer  to  the  air–dried  DNAs  in  their  PFA 
containers, the materials were allowed to equilibrate at 4 °C until there was complete visual disappearance of solids 
(several days to weeks, depending on the material).  After concentration adjustment, the solubilized materials were 
stored  in  their  PFA  containers  at  4 °C  until  vialing.    Just  prior  to  vialing,  each  material  was  brought  to  room 
temperature in its PFA container inside a laminar flow hood.  The solution was gently mixed.  Each solution was 
transferred  in  turn  to  pre–labeled  sterile  vials  with  an  automatic  pipette,  and  the  vials  were  capped.    After  the 
production run for that component was complete, all vials were placed into storage at 4 °C. 
 
Component C:  Purified unsheared genomic human DNA was purchased from Sigma–Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO.  
Literature  accompanying  the  material  indicated  that  the  material  was  purified  by  equilibrium  buoyant  density 
ultracentrifugation in cesium chloride, dialyzed against a solution of 1 mmol/L sodium chloride, 1 mmol/L disodium 
EDTA, and 1 mmol/L Tris HCl, pH 7.5, and then lyophilized.  Solubilization, storage, and vialing of this material 
was the same as described above for components A and B. 
 
Temperature and NaOH Concentration Dependence:  For all three components, the A260–320 values change less 
than 0.001 per degree Celsius change in spectral acquisition temperature from 20 °C to 24 °C.  The A260–320 values 
change by approximately 0.01 per 0.1 mol/L NaOH from final NaOH concentrations of 0.1 mol/L to 0.3 mol/L. 
 
Commutability  of  the  DNA  Mass  Concentration  Information  Values:    The  commutability  of  the  three 
SRM 2372  components  in  commonly  used  DNA  quantitation  assays  was  assessed  by  an  interlaboratory  study 
involving 32 participants and 11 non–gender–specific methods.  While the relative results for the three components 
for most methods agreed within the method reproducibilities, systematic differences in response were observed with 
specific qPCR methods.  These biases were confirmed by studies at NIST.  The observed among-method variability 
is not unexpected since different qPCR methods exploit qualitatively different molecular targets.  For information on 
the performance of the SRM 2372 components with selected qPCR methods, see reference 6.   

                                                           

(1) Certain commercial equipment, instruments, or materials are identified  in this certificate to adequately 
specify  the  experimental  procedure.  Such  identification  does  not  imply  recommendation  or  endorsement  by  the 
National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology,  nor  does  it  imply  that  the  materials  or  equipment  identified  are 
necessarily the best available for the purpose.
