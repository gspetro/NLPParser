‘ention 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended for use in evaluating analytical methods for the determination of 
selected  polychlorinated  biphenyl (PCB)  congeners,  chlorinated  pesticides,  and  polybrominated  diphenyl 
ether (PBDE)  congeners  in  human  serum  and  similar  matrices.    Reference  values  are  provided  for  selected 
polychlorinated  dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs),  polychlorinated  dibenzofurans (PCDFs),  non-ortho  PCB  congeners, 
perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), and serum lipid.  Information values are provided for selected toxaphene congeners 
and hydroxylated compounds.  A unit of SRM 1958 consists of five vials, each containing freeze-dried fortified human 
serum.  Before use, the serum in each bottle must be reconstituted with 10.7 mL of distilled or HPLC-grade water. 
 
The  development  of  SRM 1958  was  a  collaboration  between  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and 
Technology (NIST) and the Division of Laboratory Sciences, Organic Analytical Toxicology Branch, U.S. Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 
 
Certified  Mass  Fraction  Values:    Certified  values,  expressed  as  mass  fractions,  for  PCB  congeners,  chlorinated 
pesticides, and PBDE congeners along with one polybrominated biphenyl congener are provided in Tables 1, 2, and 3, 
respectively [1].  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that 
all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [2].  The certified values for the 
PCB congeners, chlorinated pesticides, and PBDE congeners are based on the agreement of results obtained at NIST 
using  one  or  more  analytical  techniques,  additional  results  from  CDC,  and  from  an  interlaboratory  study  using 
different analytical techniques.  Values are reported based on the reconstituted serum in mass fraction units.  
 
Reference  Mass  Fraction  Values:    Reference  values,  expressed  as  mass  fractions,  are  provided  in  Table 4  for 
additional PCB congeners and chlorinated pesticides; Table 5 for selected PFC compounds; and Table 6 for selected 
PCDD and PCDF congeners and non-ortho PCB congeners [1].  Reference values for serum lipids are provided in 
Table 7.  Reference values are noncertified values that are estimates of the true value; however, the values do not meet 
the NIST criteria for certification and are provided with associated uncertainties that may reflect only measurement 
precision, may not include all sources of uncertainty, or may reflect a lack of sufficient statistical agreement among 
multiple analytical methods [2].  Values are reported based on the reconstituted serum in mass fraction units. 
 
Information  Mass  Fraction  Values:    Information  values,  expressed  as  mass  fractions,  for  selected  toxaphene 
congeners, additional compounds, and Aroclor 1260 are provided in Table 8 [2].  An information value is considered 
to be a value that will be of use to the SRM user, but insufficient information is available to assess the uncertainty 
associated with the value or only a limited number of analyses were performed [1].  Values are reported based on the 
reconstituted serum in mass fraction units.  Information values cannot be used to establish metrological traceability. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 1958 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
ed  in  accordance  with  instructions  given  in  this 
until  31 August 2025,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  instructions  given  in  this 
ae  certification  is  nullified  if  the  SRM  is  damaged, 
certificate (see “Instructions for Stability, Storage, and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, 
contaminated, or otherwise modified.

NOTICE AND WARNING TO USERS 
 
SRM 1958  IS  INTENDED  FOR  RESEARCH  USE.    THIS  IS  A  HUMAN  SOURCE  MATERIAL.    HANDLE 
PRODUCT  AS  A  BIOHAZARDOUS  MATERIAL  CAPABLE  OF  TRANSMITTING  INFECTIOUS  DISEASE.  
The  supplier  has  reported  that  each  donor  unit  of  plasma  used  in  the  preparation  of  this  product  was  tested  by 
FDA-licensed tests and found to be negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), HIV-1 antigen, hepatitis B 
surface antigen, and hepatitis C.  However, no known test method can offer complete assurance that hepatitis B virus, 
hepatitis C virus, HIV, or other infectious agents are absent from this material.  Accordingly, this human blood-based 
product should be handled at the Biosafety Level 2 or higher as recommended for any POTENTIALLY INFECTIOUS 
HUMAN SERUM OR BLOOD SPECIMEN in the CDC/National Institutes of Health (NIH) Manual [3]. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR STABILITY, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
Stability and Storage:  The serum is freeze-dried and should be stored in a refrigerator at temperatures between 2 °C 
and 8 °C until ready for use.  It should not be frozen or exposed to sunlight or ultraviolet radiation.  After reconstitution, 
the contents should be used immediately or stored between 2 °C and 8 °C until ready for use, preferably within 4 h.  
Freezing of the reconstituted material is not recommended. 
 
Use:  Bring the vial to room temperature, remove the metal closure, and lightly tap the bottom of the vial to dislodge 
any dried serum particles from the stopper.  Carefully remove the stopper to avoid possible loss of serum particles.  
Use a dispenser of known accuracy to slowly add 10.7 mL of distilled or HPLC-grade water at 20 °C to 25 °C to 
the sides of the vial while continually turning the vial.  Replace the stopper, swirl the vial two or three times, and let 
stand for approximately 10 min.  Mix contents by gently swirling, let stand for approximately 30 min, swirl again, let 
stand 10 min, and finally invert the vial several times.  Do not shake vigorously because this will cause frothing.  Total 
time for reconstitution is approximately 1 h.  After reconstituting, use contents as soon as possible or store between 
2 °C and 8 °C until analysis, preferably within 4 h. 
 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Source  of  Material:    Plasma  was  acquired  from  various  blood  banks  located  around  the  U.S.:    Wilmington  and 
Greenville, NC;  Jacksonville  and  Orlando, FL;  Jonesboro, AR;  Flagstaff, AZ;  Gallup  and  Albuquerque, NM; 
Memphis, TN; Portland, ME; and Carbondale, IL. 
 
Preparation  of  Material:    Preparation  of  the  serum  was  performed  by  Aalto  Scientific,  Ltd.,  Carlsbad, CA.  
Following the precipitation of fibrin and filtration, the serum was pooled (approximately 200 L total) and was stored 
at 4 °C.  The pool was split into two for production of SRMs 1957 and 1958.  Before bottling, approximately 710 mL 
of methanol containing 169 compounds at varying mass concentrations (Appendix A) was added to 100 L of serum, 
which was then stirred for 4 h.  Using a calibrated automatic pipette, 10.7 mL aliquots of serum were dispensed into 
30 mL amber glass vials.  The samples were lyophilized.  The samples were considered dry when a stable vacuum 
and temperature were achieved.

ANALYTICAL METHODS USED AT NIST  
 
For NIST Method 1, the freeze-dried serum in each of ten vials was reconstituted by adding 10.7 mL (mass known) 
of HPLC-grade water.  A known amount of internal standard solution (containing selected 13C-labeled PCB congeners, 
selected 13C-labeled pesticides, 13C-labeled PBDE 209, fluorinated PBDE 47, PCB 103, and PCB 198) was added to 
each bottle, which was sonicated for 15 min and allowed to equilibrate overnight under refrigeration.  After samples 
were removed from refrigeration and allowed to reach ambient temperature, 10 mL of formic acid was added, as a 
denaturation  agent,  followed  immediately  by  10 mL  of  a  1:1 (volume  fraction)  mixture  of  n-hexane  and  methyl 
tert-butyl ether for extraction.  The samples were vortexed and left to stand for 0.5 h with occasional mixing.  After 
centrifugation to obtain a sharp phase boundary, the upper organic phase was transferred to a concentration vessel.  
The extraction was repeated twice with 10 mL of n-hexane each time.  The combined hexane layers were concentrated 
using an automated evaporation system to approximately 4 mL.  Approximately 2 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid 
was added to the concentration vessel with swirling.  Following phase separation, the hexane phase was removed, and 
the  sulfuric  acid  phase  was  washed  twice  using  4 mL  portions  of  n-hexane.    The  combined  hexane  phases  were 
concentrated to approximately 0.5 mL for silica solid-phase extraction (SPE) clean-up.  The fraction of interest was 
eluted with 15 mL of 10 % (volume fraction) dichloromethane in hexane.  The concentrated samples were analyzed 
using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) operated in both the electron impact (EI) and negative ion 
chemical ionization (NICI) mode.  A 0.25 mm × 60 m fused silica capillary column containing a non-polar proprietary 
phase (DB-XLB, Agilent Technologies, Wilmington, DE) 0.25 µm film thickness was used for the EI analysis (NIST 
Method 1a)  while  a  0.25 mm × 60  m  fused  silica  capillary  column  containing  a  50 % (mole  fraction) 
phenyl-substituted  methylpolysiloxane  phase (DB-17MS,  Agilent  Technologies)  was  used  for 
the  NICI 
analysis (NIST Method 1b).  All injections were 1 µL using an on-column inlet. 
 
For NIST Method 2, the freeze-dried serum in each of six vials was reconstituted by adding 10.7 mL (mass known) 
of HPLC-grade water.  A known amount of internal standard solution (containing selected 13C-labeled PCB congeners, 
selected 13C-labeled pesticides, 13C-labeled PBDE 209, and selected fluorinated PBDE congeners) was added to a 2 g 
serum subsample from each bottle, vortexed, and allowed to equilibrate overnight under refrigeration.  After samples 
were removed from refrigeration and allowed to reach ambient temperature, 2 mL of formic acid was added followed 
by 3 mL of 20 % (volume fraction) dichloromethane in hexane.  Samples were extracted using focused microwave 
extraction.  Following extraction, samples were centrifuged, the organic phase was removed, and another 3 mL of 
20 % (volume fraction) dichloromethane in hexane was added.  The extraction was repeated, and the organic phases 
were  combined.    Following  concentration  with  a  solvent  exchange  to  iso-octane,  samples  were  cleaned-up  on  a 
sulfuric-acid  silica  column  followed  by  clean-up  on  an  alumina  column (5 %  deactivated).    The  eluant  from  the 
clean-up columns  was concentrated to 0.2 mL  with a solvent change to iso-octane  for analysis.  The concentrated 
samples were analyzed using GC/MS in the EI mode (NIST Method 2a) with a 0.18 mm × 30 m fused silica capillary 
column  containing  a  5 %  (mole  fraction)  phenyl-substituted  methylpolysiloxane  phase (DB-5MS,  Agilent 
Technologies)  0.18 µm  film  thickness. 
  All  injections  were  20 µL  using  a  programmable  temperature 
vaporization (PTV) inlet.  For NIST Method 2b, the same extracts, same column, and PTV inlet were used with the 
GC/MS in the NICI mode.  For NIST Method 2c, the same extracts were analyzed by GC/MS in the NICI mode using 
on-column  injection  into  a  0.18 mm × 10  m  fused  silica  capillary  column  containing  a  5 % (mole  fraction) 
phenyl-substituted methylpolysiloxane phase (DB-5MS, Agilent Technologies), 0.18 µm film thickness. 
 
For NIST Method 3, the freeze-dried serum in each of six vials was reconstituted by adding 10.7 mL (mass known) 
of HPLC-grade water.  A known amount of internal standard solution (containing selected 13C-labeled hydroxylated 
compounds)  was  added  to  each  bottle,  vortexed,  and  allowed  to  equilibrate  overnight  under  refrigeration.    After 
samples were removed from refrigeration and allowed to reach ambient temperature, 2 mL of formic acid and 0.5 mL 
of 6 mol/L  hydrochloric acid (HCl)  were added to the serum sample followed by 2 mL of 20 % (volume  fraction) 
dichloromethane  in  hexane.    Samples  were  extracted  using  focused  microwave  extraction.    Following  extraction, 
samples  were  centrifuged,  the  organic  phase  was  removed,  and  another  3 mL  of  20 % (volume  fraction) 
dichloromethane  in  hexane  was  added.    The  extraction  was  repeated,  and  the  organic  phases  were  combined.  
Potassium hydroxide (KOH) was then added to the organic phase.  The samples were shaker-extracted for 15 min and 
centrifuged,  and  the  KOH  was  removed.    This  step  was  repeated  two  times  and  the  KOH  phases  combined.  
HCl (6 mol/L) was added to the KOH phases, followed by 2 mL 20 % (volume fraction) dichloromethane in hexane.

the  hexane  phases.    A  silica  column  was  used  for  clean-up  followed  by  analysis  using  liquid  chromatography  
coupled  to  a  triple  quadrupole  mass  spectrometer (LC/MS/MS)  using  a  C18 column  (Agilent  Eclipse  Plus C18, 
3.0 mm × 150 mm × 3.5 μm, Agilent Technologies) with a methanol-water gradient.

For NIST Method 4, the freeze-dried serum in each of five vials was reconstituted by adding 10.7 mL (mass known) 
of HPLC-grade water.  A known amount of internal standard solution (containing selected  13C-labeled PFCs) was 
added to a 0.15 g serum subsample from each bottle, vortexed, and allowed to equilibrate overnight under refrigerated 
conditions.  After samples  were removed from refrigeration and allowed to reach ambient temperature, 0.6 mL of 
50 % (volume fraction) formic acid in water was added, and the samples were loaded onto 60 mg Oasis WAX SPE 
columns (Waters, Milford, MA).  Compounds of interest were eluted off the columns using methanol followed by 
2 mL of 1 % (volume fraction) ammonium hydroxide in methanol.  Following concentration, samples were analyzed 
using  LC/MS/MS  with  a  C8  column (Thermo  Betasil  C8,  100 mm × 2.1 mm × 5 μm,  Thermo  Fisher  Scientific, 
Waltham, MA) and methanol-ammonium acetate in water gradient. 
 
For all of the NIST methods, multi-point calibration response curves  for the compounds of interest relative to the 
internal  standards  were  determined  by  processing  gravimetrically  diluted  solutions  of  SRM 2261  Chlorinated 
in 
Pesticides 
2,2,4-Trimethylpentane (Nominal Concentration 2 µg/mL), SRM 2274 PCB Congener Solution-II in Isooctane, and 
SRM 2275 Chlorinated Pesticide Solution-II in Isooctane plus gravimetrically prepared solutions of the additional 
analytes of interest with the internal standards added.  SRM 1589a PCBs, Pesticides, PBDEs, and Dioxins/Furans in 
Human Serum was analyzed with each set of samples as a quality control material. 
 
CDC
ANALYTICAL METHODS USED AT CDC 
 
For  the  analytes  other  than  PFCs,  details  for  the  analytical  methods  used  at  CDC  can  be  found  in  Patterson  and 
Turner [3]  and  Sjödin  et  al. [4].    In  summary,  the  freeze-dried  serum  was  reconstituted  by  adding  10.7 mL  of 
HPLC-grade water and mixing.  The samples were stored overnight at 5 °C.  Sample extraction was performed using 
a C18 SPE method.  After addition of the internal standard solution and formic acid, the sample was eluted through an 
SPE  column  using  appropriate  solvents.    The  eluant  was  then  cleaned-up  using  a  Universal  Prep  system (Fluid 
Management Systems, Waltham, MA) containing an acid/neutral/base silica column, an alumina column, and a carbon 
column.  Corresponding 13C-labeled compounds were used as internal standards for the majority of the analytes.   
 
Gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC/HRMS) with mass resolution of 10 000 was used for the 
determination  of  the  PCBs,  chlorinated  pesticides,  PBDEs,  PCDDs,  and  PCDFs.    The  GC  column  was  a 
0.25 mm × 30 m 
fraction)  phenyl-substituted 
methylpolysiloxane  phase (DB-5MS,  J&W  Scientific,  Folsom, CA),  0.25 µm  film  thickness.    All  injections  were 
splitless with helium as the carrier gas. 
 
For  determination  of  the  PFCs,  the  freeze-dried  serum  in  each  of  three  vials  was  reconstituted  by  adding 
10.7 mL (mass  known)  of  HPLC-grade  water.    A  known  amount  of  internal  standard  solution  containing  selected 
13C-labeled PFCs was added to two 0.2 mL serum subsamples from each bottle along with 0.5 mL of 0.1 mol/L formic 
acid. 
  The  
  The  samples  were  sonicated  for  20 min  and  placed  on  an  on-line  SPE-HPLC  system. 
samples  were  loaded  onto  C18  SPE  cartridges,  and  the  compounds  of  interest  were  eluted  off  the  cartridges  
directly  into  the  LC/MS/MS  with  separation  on  a  C8 column (Thermo  Betasil  C8,  50 mm × 3 mm × 5 μm, 
ThermoHypersil-Keystone, Bellefonte, PA) using a gradient of methanol and ammonium acetate in water. 
 
INTERLABORATORY STUDY 
 
The four laboratories participating in the interlaboratory study used their usual methods for these analyses.  Not every 
laboratory reported data for every analyte.  When more than one laboratory did report data for a particular analyte, the 
mean of the results was used for combination with other data to assign the certified and reference mass fraction values.  
 
Total Cholesterol and Associated Analytes:  The reference mass fractions total cholesterol and triglycerides were 
determined using standard enzymatic methods by the CDC and the Institut national de santé publique du Québec.  In 
the cholesterol analysis, the esters were first cleaved (using cholesterol esterase), and then the total serum cholesterol 
was measured by a cholesterol oxidase - peroxidase method.  The absorbance of the resulting chromophore at 540 nm 
is directly proportional to total cholesterol.   “Free” cholesterol was  measured by an enzymatic  method similar the 
method for total cholesterol but did not include the cholesterol esterase.  In the triglyceride analysis, glycerides were 
hydrolyzed with a fungal lipase and the liberated glycerol was estimated from the rate of change in absorbance at 
340 nm.    No  corrections  were  made  for  the  free  glycerol  content  of  the  serum.    Serum  choline-containing 
phospholipids were also measured by an enzymatic method in which the phospholipids are hydrolyzed to free choline 
by phospholipase D.
