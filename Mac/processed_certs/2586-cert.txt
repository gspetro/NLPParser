Certificate of Analysis 
 
Standard Reference Material® 2586 
 
Trace Elements in Soil Containing Lead from Paint 
(Nominal Mass Fraction 500 mg/kg Lead) 

3  Fraction 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended for use in evaluating analytical methods for the determination of 
lead,  trace  elements,  and  perfluorooctane  sulfonate (PFOS)  in  soil.    SRM 2586  is  a  blended  mixture  of  soil  
samples collected from urban areas where the principal source of lead is believed to be from old house lead-based 
paint.    All  values  are  reported  as  mass  fractions [1],  on  a  dry-mass  basis  and  are  based  on  measurements  using  a  
sample mass of at least 200 mg.  A unit of SRM 2586 consists of approximately 55 g of material with a particle size 
of <75 μm (200 mesh). 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values:  The certified mass fraction values for four environmentally important elements are 
provided in Table 1.  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in 
that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or accounted for by NIST [2].  The measurands are 
the certified mass fractions of the elements in Table 1 and are metrologically traceable to the SI unit of mass fraction 
expressed as milligrams per kilogram. 
 
Reference Mass Fraction Values:  Reference mass fraction values for additional elements are provided in Table 2. 
The reference mass fraction value for PFOS is provided in Table 3.  Reference values are noncertified values that are 
the best estimate of the true value; however, the values do not meet NIST criteria for certification [2] and are provided 
with associated uncertainties that may reflect only measurement reproducibility and may not include all sources of 
uncertainty  or  may  reflect  a  lack  of  sufficient  statistical  agreement  determined  by  the  methods  indicated.    The 
measurands  are  the  mass  fractions  listed  in  Tables 2  and  3,  as  determined  by  the  methods  indicated,  and  are 
metrologically traceable to the SI unit of mass fraction expressed as milligrams per kilogram. 
 
Information Mass Fraction Values:  Information mass fraction values are listed in Table 4 for additional elements. 
An information value may be of interest and use to the SRM user; however, insufficient information is available to 
adequately assess the uncertainty associated with these values [2].  Information values cannot be used to establish 
metrological traceability. 
 
Expiration  of  Certification:    The  certification  of  SRM 2586  is  valid,  within  the  uncertainty  specified,  until 
30 September 2023,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  given  in  this 
damaged, 
certificate (see “Instructions for Storage, Handling, and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, 
contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Overall  direction  and  coordination  of  the  technical  measurements  leading  to  the  certification  of  this  SRM  were 
performed by R.L. Watters, Jr. of the NIST Office of Reference Materials and G.C. Turk and C.E. Bryan of the NIST 
Chemical Sciences Division. 
 
Partial  financial  support  for  the  development  of  this  SRM  was  provided  by  the  U.S.  Environmental  Protection 
Research
Agency (EPA)  under  the  direction  of  project  manager  B. Schumacher  of  the  EPA  National  Exposure  Research 
Laboratory (Las Vegas, NV).

INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE, HANDLING, AND USE 
 
Storage:  SRM 2586 is packaged as a dry material in glass bottles.  The SRM must be stored in its original bottle at 
temperatures less than 30 °C away from fumes and direct sunlight. 
 
Use:  To relate analytical determinations to the certified values on this Certificate of Analysis, a minimum sample 
mass of 200 mg should be used and the sample should be dried according to the “Instructions for Drying”.  Sample 
preparation procedures should also be designed to effect complete dissolution in order to relate the determined value 
to the certified value.   
 
Instructions  for  Drying:    Samples  should  be  oven  dried  for  2 h  at  105 °C.    For  the  determination  of  volatile 
elements (arsenic and mercury), samples should be analyzed as received; separate samples should be dried according 
to these instructions to obtain a correction factor for moisture.  Moisture corrections are then made to the measurement 
results before comparing them to the certified values.  This alternative drying method may also be used for nonvolatile 
elements. 
 
COLLECTION, PREPARATION, AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Collection:    Soil  material  used  in  the  preparation  of  SRM 2586  was  derived  from  approximately  20 000  samples 
collected in the Baltimore, MD, area as part of an EPA study conducted in 1990.  Selection and classification of the 
soil samples used for this SRM were coordinated through R. Fahy of the Maryland Department of Public Health. 
 
Preparation: 
the  U.S.  Geological  Survey (USGS) 
laboratory (Denver, CO),  under  the direction of S.A. Wilson.   The  20 000 soil samples  were  initially  combined  in 
10 separate 40 L containers, the contents of which were blended and chemically analyzed.  This information was then 
used to combine and blend the sub-sets into a single set with a target lead concentration of 500 mg/kg.  The blended 
mixture was ground to <75 μm (200 mesh) using a Hardinger ball mill equipped with an air separator system and 
mixed for 20 h using a cross-flow V-blender.  The material was then split into 8 kg aliquots and sterilized using 
60Co irradiation.  After sterilization the material was re-combined, blended for 3 h, and bottled. 
 
Analysis:  Certification analyses were performed in the NIST Chemical Sciences Division, at USGS, and during an 
interlaboratory comparison.  The analytical methods used and the analysts are listed in Table 5.  All values are reported 
as mass fractions [2], on a dry-mass basis (see “Instructions for Drying”), and are based on measurements using a 
sample mass of at least 200 mg. 

  The  preparation  of  SRM 2586  was  performed  at 

  
Certified Mass Fraction Values and Uncertainties:  Certified values and uncertainties for elements in SRM 2586 
are provided in Table 1.  The certified values are based on results from two or more NIST independent analytical 
methods and additional results from methods used at USGS (Table 5).

The certified values are equally weighted means from the combination of results provided by NIST and USGS.  The 
uncertainty is calculated as, U = kuc + B.  The quantity uc is the combined standard uncertainty calculated according 
to  the  ISO/JCGM  and  NIST  Guides [3]  and  is  intended  to  represent,  at  the  level  of  one  standard  deviation,  the 
combined effect of within-method variation and material inhomogeneity.  The coverage factor, k, is determined from

for  each  element.    B  is  a  bias  adjustment  for  the  difference  between  methods,  which  is  the  maximum  difference 
between the certified value and method means [4]. 
 
Reference Mass Fraction Values for the Elements:  Reference values and uncertainties for elements in SRM 2586 
are given in Table 2.  The reference values for Ce, Dy, Eu, Gd, Hg, La, Nd, Pr, Sm, Y, and Yb are derived from a 
-e  derived  from  two  or  more 
single method performed at NIST.  The reference values for the remaining elements are derived from two or more 
methods performed at NIST and/or USGS (Table 5).

The  element  reference  values  derived  from  a  single  method  at  NIST  are  the  means  of  the  measurements  for  the 
individual method.  The expanded uncertainty is calculated as, U = kuc, where uc is the combined standard uncertainty 
calculated according to the ISO/JCGM Guide [3], and k is the coverage factor corresponding to approximately 95 % 
confidence.

The element reference values derived from two or more methods are equally weighted means from the combination 
of results provided by NIST and USGS.  The uncertainty is calculated as, U = kuc+ B.  The quantity uc is the combined 
standard uncertainty calculated according to the ISO Guide [3] and is intended to represent, at the level of one standard 
dard
deviation, the combined effect of within-method variation and material inhomogeneity.  The coverage factor, k, is 
determined from  the Student-t distribution corresponding to the calculated effective degrees of freedom and 95 % 
level of confidence for each element. B is a bias adjustment for the difference between methods, which is the maximum 
difference between the certified value and method means [4]. 
 
 
Reference Mass Fraction Value for Perfluorooctane Sulfonate (PFOS):  The reference value and uncertainty for 
PFOS in SRM 2586 is provided in Table 3.  The mass fraction for PFOS is based on three sets of data (two sets from 
NIST and one set from an interlaboratory study) (Table 5).

The  reference  value  is  the  equally  weighted  mean  from  the  combination  of  results  provided  by  NIST  and  the 
interlaboratory study.  The uncertainty of each method mean is the standard deviation of that mean.  The expanded 
uncertainty of the combined mean is calculated as, U = kuc, where uc is the combined standard uncertainty calculated 
according to the ISO/JCGM Guide [3], and k is the coverage factor corresponding to approximately 95 % confidence. 
The uncertainty of the combined mean is calculated using a bootstrap procedure based on a Gaussian random effects 
model for the between-method effects [3,5–7].

User Experience with SRM 2586:  In order to demonstrate user experience with SRM 2586, a number of laboratories 
analyzed this material, using a variety of dissolution and instrumental methods.  For lead, this was done through the 
Environmental  Lead  Proficiency  Analytical  Testing  Program (ELPAT),  where  SRM 2586  was  included  as  an 
unknown for Round Robin number 13.  Data for As, Cd, Cr, and Hg were supplied by volunteer laboratories in a round 
robin  exercise  organized  by  NIST. 
included  EPA-SW846-3050A, 
EPA-SW846-3051 [8], and others.  As these methods may not effect complete sample dissolution, the results obtained 
using these methods tend to be lower than the certified values.  These results were not used in calculating the certified 
values of SRM 2586.
