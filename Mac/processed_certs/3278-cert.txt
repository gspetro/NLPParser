Certificate of Analysis 
 
Standard Reference Material® 3278 
 
Tocopherols in Edible Oils 

 
This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  use  in  validating  analytical  methods  for  the 
determination of tocopherols in edible oils and similar matrices.  This SRM can also be used for quality assurance 
when  assigning  values  to  in-house  control  materials.   A  unit  of  SRM 3278  consists  of  five ampoules  of  oil  each 
containing approximately 1 mL of material under argon. 
 
The  development  of  SRM 3278  was  a  collaboration  between  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and 
Technology (NIST) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS). 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values:  The certified mass fraction values of tocopherols are provided in Table 1.  Certified 
values were derived from the combination of results provided by NIST using three or four analytical methods.  A NIST 
certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that all known or suspected 
sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [1].  The certified values in this material are the equally 
weighted means of the individual sets of NIST results; the associated uncertainties are expanded uncertainties at the 
95 % level of confidence [2,3].  Certified values are reported on an “as-received” basis in mass fraction units [4]. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 3278 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until 30 August 2027, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with instructions given in this certificate 
(see  “Instructions  for  Storage  and  Use”).    The  certification  is  nullified  if  the  SRM  is  damaged,  contaminated,  or 
is  damaged,  contaminated,  or 
otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate this notification. 
 
Coordination of the technical measurements leading to the certification of this SRM was performed by L.C. Sander, 
and S.A. Wise of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division and K.E. Sharpless of the NIST Special Programs Office. 
 
Acquisition and preparation of the material were coordinated by K.E. Sharpless. 
 
Analytical measurements at NIST were performed by C.A. Rimmer of the NIST Analytical Chemistry Division 
and K. Putzbach, formerly of NIST. 
 
Support for the development of SRM 3278 was provided in part by the NIH Office of Dietary Supplements.  Technical 
consultation was provided by J.M. Betz (NIH-ODS). 
 
Statistical analysis was provided by J.H. Yen of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division. 
 
Office  of  Reference
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Office  of  Reference 
Materials.

RESEARCH 

NOTICE AND WARNING TO USERS 
 
SRM 3278 IS INTENDED FOR RESEARCH USE ONLY, NOT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE AND USE 
 
Storage:  Unopened ampoules of SRM 3278 should be stored at controlled room temperature (20 °C to 25 °C), in the 
dark, until required for use. 
 
Use:  Prior to removal of a test portion for analysis, the contents of the ampoule should be mixed thoroughly.  The 
recommended minimum sample size is 0.05 g; test portions used for NIST analyses described below were 0.05 g to 
2 g. 
 
SOURCE, PREPARATION, AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Material  Acquisition  and  Preparation:    Vegetable  oils  were  combined  to  give  an  α-tocopherol/γ-tocopherol 
peak-area ratio of approximately 1:1.  This entailed blending 10 % soybean oil, 10 % canola oil, 10 % safflower oil, 
and 70 % sunflower oil (mass fractions).  Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) was added as an antioxidant at a final mass 
fraction of approximately 500 mg/kg. 
 
Analytical Approach for Determination of Tocopherols:  Value assignment of the mass fractions of tocopherols in 
SRM 3278 was based on the combination of measurements from three different analytical methods at NIST using 
monomeric C30, polymeric C30, and naphthalene LC columns with absorbance and/or fluorescence detection.  Four 
independently prepared calibrants were used for each of the methods.  Calibrant solutions containing the individual 
tocopherols were prepared gravimetrically at levels intended to approximate the levels of the tocopherols in the SRM.  
A single internal standard solution was used for the calibrants and samples.  Samples were diluted in ethanol containing 
an internal standard (tocol) prior to analysis; a few drops of isopropanol were added to increase the oil’s solubility.

250 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 µm particle size Nacalai Tesque Co., Japan) using absorbance detection at 297 nm and 
an isocratic mobile phase of 90 % methanol and 10 % water (volume fractions) is provided in the figure.  The 
column was held at 5 ºC with a recirculating water bath.

monomeric 
Homogeneity  Assessment:    The  homogeneity  of  tocopherols  was  assessed  at  NIST  by  using  the  monomeric 
2 
C30 column with fluorescence detection.  An analysis of variance did not show inhomogeneity for 0.05 g to 2 g test 
portions. 
 
Value Assignment:  The equally weighted means from each set of data were used to calculate the assigned values. 
Because of interferences, three methods were used to provide values for α-, β-, and γ-tocopherol; all methods were 
used for δ-tocopherol.  Analytical methods are identified in Table 1. 
 
                                                           

(1) Certain  commercial  instruments,  materials,  or  processes  are  identified  in  this  certificate  to  adequately  specify  the 
experimental procedure.  Such identification does not imply recommendation or endorsement by the National Institute of Standards 
undards
and Technology, nor does it imply that the instruments, materials, or processes identified are necessarily the best available for the 
purpose.

Certified Mass Fraction Values:  Each certified mass fraction value is an equally weighted mean of the individual sets 
of results provided by NIST.  The uncertainty in the certified value, calculated according to the method described in the 
ISO/JCGM Guide [2,3], is expressed as an expanded uncertainty, U.  The expanded uncertainty is calculated as U = kuc, 
where uc is intended to represent, at the level of one standard deviation, the combined effect of between-method and 
within-method components of uncertainty.  The coverage factor, k = 2, is determined from the Student's t-distribution 
corresponding to the appropriate associated degrees of freedom and approximately 95 % confidence for each analyte.  
The  measurand  is  the  certified  mass  fraction  value  reported  on  an  “as-received”  basis  in  mass  fraction  units [4]; 
metrological traceability is to the derived SI unit for mass fraction expressed as micrograms per gram.
