This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended for use in the verification of the transmittance and absorbance 
scales of spectrophotometers in the ultraviolet and visible spectral regions.  SRM 2031c is a transfer standard certified 
using  the  NIST  Materials  Measurement  Laboratory  Transfer  Spectrophotometer  (MMLTS) [1]  with  traceability 
through  the  NIST  second  generation  High  Accuracy  Spectrophotometer (HAS II),  modeled  after  the  original 
instrument [2].  A unit  consists of three individual neutral-density filters in separate metal holders and one empty 
filter  holder,  all  stored  in  a  black  anodized-aluminum  container [3,4].    The  exposed  surface  of  each  filter  is 
approximately 29 mm × 8 mm, measuring from a point 1.5 mm above the base of the filter holder (see Figure 1).  The 
filter holders are provided with shutters that protect the filters when not in use.  Each filter-containing holder bears an 
identification number for the set and an individual filter number (10, 30, or 90) that corresponds to the nominal percent 
transmittance (100 × transmittance) of the filter. 
 
Certified  Values  of  Transmittance  Density  and  Transmittance:    Certified  transmittance  density  values, 
independently  determined  for  each  filter  at  22 °C ± 1 °C  and  at  ten  wavelengths  in  the  ultraviolet  and  visible 
portions of  the  electromagnetic  spectrum,  are  given  in  Table 1.    These  values  are  calculated  from  measured 
transmittances (T) as –log10(T), and should be indicated by the absorbance (A) scale of the spectrophotometer, if the 
filters are measured with the empty filter holder in the reference beam.  The corresponding certified transmittance 
values are given in Table 2.  The expanded uncertainties allow for possible changes due to slight surface contamination 
and fundamental material effects over the two year period following certification.  The certified values are valid for 
instrumental  spectral  slit  width  values  of  5 nm  or  less  (see  “Instrument  Dependence  Warning”).    The  certified 
transmittance  of  these  filters  is  traceable  to  the  regular  transmittance  scale  maintained  at  NIST  as  realized  by  the 
primary reference spectrometer, HAS II [2]. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  This certification of SRM 2031c is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
for  two  years  from  the  date  of  certification  listed  in  Tables 1  and 2,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in 
accordance  with  instructions  given  in  this  certificate  (see  “Instructions  for  Handling,  Storage,  and  Use”).    The 
certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification.  The set may be returned to 
NIST for cleaning and recertification as required by expiration or contamination.  Recertification can be arranged by 
contacting  the  NIST  Optical  Filters  Program  at  (301) 975–8533  or  at  filter.recert@nist.gov.    Instructions  for 
recertification are located on the NIST web site [5].

Materials. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
Handling  and  Storage:    The  SRM 2031c  set  is  stored  in  an  aluminum  container  to  minimize  contamination  of 
the filter surfaces with particulate matter due to static charge.  Each filter is placed in a cylindrical cavity to prevent any 
contact between the filter face and the walls of the storage container.  Each filter holder is provided with a flat leaf 
spring that is inserted into the cylindrical cavity of the unit for transportation.  These springs should be removed during 
use.  It is recommended that the filter in the holder be handled only by the edges with soft, powder-free, polyethylene 
gloves, and optical lens tissue.  When not in use, the filters should be stored in the supplied storage container.  Extended 
exposure to laboratory atmosphere and dusty surroundings should be avoided.  If the surface of the filter becomes 
contaminated, the SRM set should be returned to NIST for recertification; do NOT attempt to clean it.  Note:  Improper 
storage or handling of the filters may cause changes in the transmittance. 
 
Use:    The  measured  transmittance  of  the  filters  depends  upon  the  intrinsic  properties  of  the  material  and  the 
wavelength and geometry of the optical beam.  It can be affected by other factors such as stray light, temperature, and 
the positioning of the filter.  Changes in the transmittance may be caused by changes in surface conditions, aging of 
the filter, exposure to a harmful atmosphere, or improper handling [3,4].  Because the transmittance of these filters 
exhibits appreciable optical neutrality, the dependence of transmittance on slit width is not anticipated, and spectral 
slit widths up to 5 nm may be used (See “Instrument Dependence Warning”). 
 
Instrument verification  should  be  performed  at  a  sample temperature between 20 °C  and 24 °C.    The  empty  filter 
holder provided is to be used in the reference beam of the spectrophotometer so that approximately equivalent stray 
radiation conditions are maintained for both beams.  The shutters provided with each filter must be removed at the 
time of measurement and replaced after the measurements have been completed.  Measurements performed outside 
of these specified conditions or the optical geometry used for certification (see “Determination of Transmittances”) 
could produce transmittance values that differ from the certified values. 
 
To  demonstrate  that  a  user’s  measurements  are  traceable,  within  acceptable  limits,  to  the  accuracy  transferred  by 
SRM 2031c,  the  user  must  first  determine  the  required  tolerances  or  acceptable  uncertainty  for  the  application  in 
question.  It is recommended that a number of replicate measurements be made for each filter and wavelength, with 
removal and replacement of the filter between replicate measurements.  The user should then compare each mean 
value and the user-defined tolerance with the NIST certified value and expanded uncertainty in Table 1 or Table 2.  
An acceptable level of agreement between a user’s measurements and the certified value is demonstrated if any part 
of the range defined by the NIST certified value and its expanded uncertainty overlaps any part of the user’s tolerance 
band defined by the measured mean and the user-defined level of acceptable uncertainty [6]. 
 
Instrument  Dependence  Warning:    In  some  commercial  instruments,  the  metal-on-fused-silica  filters  can  generate 
reflection effects in the sample compartment that can degrade the accuracy of the measured transmittances.  During 
the  development  of  SRM 2031,  the  presence  and  magnitude  of  such  effects  were  studied  and  were  found  to  be 
negligible, within the uncertainty specified, in the spectrophotometers tested [4].  However, for certain instruments, 
these effects could become significant.  In addition, unexpected spectral bandwidth effects have also been reported in 
some commercial instruments. If such effects are detected or suspected, the user should contact NIST Optical Filters 
Program,  at  (301) 975-8533  or  via  email  at  filter.recert@nist.gov  for  assistance  and  instructions  as  described  in 
reference 5.  
 
PREPARATION AND VALUE ASSIGNMENT(1) 
 
Preparation:  Ground and polished fused-silica components were produced by Starna Cells, Inc. (Atascadero, CA).  
For filters 10 and 30, reflective metallic coatings were applied by evaporating different thicknesses of metal onto 1.5 
mm thick fused-silica plates that have been precision ground and polished.  These metal films are protected by 2.0 
mm thick fused-silica cover plates optically contacted to the base plates.  Filter 90 is a 2.0 mm thick fused-silica plate 
having a nominal transmittance of 0.9.  Each fused-silica piece used in SRM 2031c has been polished to a flatness of 
two fringes of the mercury green line (546.1 nm), and assembled filters were tested for a deviation from parallelism 
of less than 2 × 10-4 radians.  Prior to certification measurements, the filters were aged at NIST for at least six months, 
and each filter was examined for surface defects and the condition of the optical contact. 

  

 

(1) Certain commercial equipment, instrumentation, or materials are identified in this certificate to adequately specify the 
experimental procedure.  Such identification does not imply recommendation or endorsement by the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the purpose.

Determination of Transmittances:  The transmittance measurements are made with the empty filter holder used as 
the reference at an ambient temperature of 22 °C ± 1 °C using an Agilent Cary 6000i spectrophotometer qualified as 
a transfer spectrophotometer [1].  Transmittance traceability is maintained by comparison measurements to the NIST 
HAS II [2] with the results of the comparison reflected in the certification uncertainties [1].  The effective spectral slit 
width used to determine the certified values is 0.8 nm.  The transmittance measurements are made by projecting the 
vertical image of the slit onto the middle of the entrance face of the filter, with the optical centerline 15 mm above the 
base of the filter.  The filter is mounted in a multiple filter carriage in the spectrophotometer.  Each transmittance 
value reported in Table 2 is the average of three transmittance values measured with a one second averaging time, 
with the instrument cycling through the ten wavelengths, three times for each filter in the carriage.  The filters are 
measured in the spectrophotometer in a position perpendicular to the incident light beam, as shown in Figure 1.  Each 
transmittance value is calculated from a measurement of the intensity transmitted through the filter and a measurement 
of the blank (empty filter holder) at the beginning of the measurement of each set of three filters.  Transmittance is 
monitored for temporal drift several times over the filter aging period of six months; the aging period is extended for 
sets with excessive drift.  Only the final measurements are used as the basis for the certified values. 
 
Uniformity:  The transmittance density uniformity of each SRM 2031c filter is tested at five certified wavelengths 
by  comparing the  transmittance  density  measured  at  the  center  of  each  filter  with  that measured  5 mm  above  and 
below the center.  Filters are rejected if the relative difference of the two readings exceeds the allowable limits that 
have been established.  These limits are reflected in the uncertainty determination.  
 
Traceability:    Traceability  in  regular  spectral  transmittance  is  achieved  by  comparative  measurements  of 
metal-on-fused-silica neutral-density filters on the MMLTS and the HAS II.  The master set of reference filters is 
calibrated annually by the HAS II and measured at least quarterly on the MMLTS to assess the comparability of the 
scales.  The comparison measurements are used to compute the bias of the MMLTS with respect to the HAS II for 
each nominal transmittance density level and wavelength [1]. 
 
Determination of Expanded Uncertainties:  The expanded uncertainties, U, of the certified transmittance density 
values of Table 1 are determined from the measured bias and from standard uncertainties (i.e., estimated standard 
deviation equivalents) of component uncertainty sources discussed below, and a coverage factor k = 2 based on the 
Student’s t-distribution [1,7].  The expanded uncertainty defines an interval within which the unknown value of the 
transmittance  density  would  be  asserted  to  lie  with  a  level  of  confidence  of  approximately  95 %  for  more  than 
30 degrees of freedom (DF).  This uncertainty includes “Type A” uncertainties evaluated by statistical methods and 
“Type B” uncertainties evaluated by other means [7]. 
 
Bias determination for traceability was by means of three independent measurements made on each of two control 
sets on the MMLTS and on the HAS II.  The average and sample standard deviation of the bias were computed for 
each filter level (10, 30, or 90) and wavelength.  The maximum value of the bias and of the standard uncertainty of 
the bias over all ten wavelengths were assigned to conservatively represent all wavelengths at that level.  The resulting 
bias and standard uncertainty of the bias were combined with the uncertainty components representing filter properties 
and direct measurement properties as described in reference 1 to yield the final expanded uncertainty values reflected 
in Tables 1 and 2. 
 
Special
The Type B uncertainty components for SRM 2031 were originally estimated from studies described in NIST Special 
Publication 260-68 [4].  Due to a change in sourcing of SRM 2031c and length of time since the publication of SP 
260-68, the Type B uncertainty components were reevaluated, which resulted in minor updates to the previous values.  
These components include uniformity (see “Uniformity”), temporal stability (drift), temperature dependence, and the 
linearity and geometry of the measurement.  The Type B standard uncertainties are derived from an estimate of the 
ranges of the components [7].
