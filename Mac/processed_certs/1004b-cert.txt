Glass Beads  Particle Size Distribution 

 
This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  use  in  evaluating  and  calibrating  particle  size 
measurement instrumentation covering the 40 µm to 150 µm range.  SRM 1004b is one of a series of SRMs for particle 
size analysis and lies between that of the finer beads of SRM 1003b and the coarser beads of SRM 1017b.  SRM 1004b is 
commonly used in the evaluation of test sieves in the range from No. 270 (53 µm) through No. 120 (125 µm).  A unit of 
SRM 1004b consists of a single bottle containing approximately 43 g of solid spherical borosilicate glass beads.  
 
Certified Values:  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that all 
known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [1].  The certified cumulative volume 
(or mass) distribution was determined using both calibrated scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and standard sieving 
procedures on samples chosen using a stratified random selection process.  The certified values are the average of results 
from SEM analyses on five bottles.  The sieve analyses of ten bottles were used to determine the variability between 
bottles as well as for a comparison with the SEM results.   
 
SEM Certification Procedure:  Sample preparation for the SEM involved both a reduction in mass and a separation into 
size fractions.  This was to achieve a representative sampling of the different size fractions, and a balanced statistical 
measure of each size fraction.  The five test bottles were sieved into seven size fractions and then riffle split with a 
spinning microriffler.  Backscatter electron images were taken at six different magnifications to obtain both adequate 
counting statistics and diameter resolution for particles in each size range.  Figure 1 is an example of one of the sieve 
fraction  images.    These  2048  by  2048 pixel  images  of  the  beads  were  acquired  from  the  SEM  into  a  computer  as 
greyscale image files via a digital interface.  Image analysis software was used to obtain the major and minor diameters 
of each glass bead based on the assumption of ellipsoidal particle shape.  Diameters (in pixels) were converted to a 
particle  volume  (prolate  spheroid)  and  particle  diameter  (geometric  mean  of  major  and  minor  diameters)  using  a 
micrometer slide calibrated at NIST.  
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 1004b is valid indefinitely, within the measurement uncertainty 
specified, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given in this certificate (see 
“Instructions for Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, or otherwise modified.  It is 
expected that some spheres will be lost with each use.  If the unit's loss exceeds 2 % of the original mass, or if spillage or 
contamination occurs, the certification will be nullified and use of the SRM should be discontinued. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
The technical direction, SEM measurements, sieve analysis, and statistical analysis leading to the certification were 
provided by J.F. Kelly of the NIST Ceramics Division. 
 
Statistical consultation was provided by K.R. Eberhardt of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division. 
 
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Measurement  Services 
Division.

Approximately 4000 beads were measured per bottle.  Particle size distributions describing the percentage of powder 
volume represented by particles with diameters less than a given length were calculated using the weighting factors 
obtained from the sieving results.  The SEM results for cumulative mass distribution of the five sample bottles are shown 
in Figure 2.  Table 1 is a listing of certified bead diameter values versus cumulative mass fraction with the mass fraction 
sequenced from 1 % to 99 % in 1 % increments.  In that table, each mass fraction value is considered exact with its 
uncertainty  associated  with  the  diameter  value.    At  each  mass  fraction,  the  certified  diameter  and  the  expanded 
uncertainty  define  a  95 %  prediction  interval.    Expanded  uncertainties  computed  according  to  the  ISO  and  NIST 
Guides [1] include allowances for measurement imprecision and material variability.  The 95 % prediction interval at 
each mass fraction predicts where the true diameter lies for 95 % of the bottles of this SRM.  Additionally, Table 2 
presents the variables reversed with diameters sequenced as exact values from 40 µm to 146 µm and the uncertainties 
associated with the certified mass fractions.  
 
Sieve Analysis Procedure:  The sieve testing was designed to provide a measure of the between-bottle variability 
(homogeneity) and a check for the certified values.  Ten bottles were selected from the total population of bottles using a 
stratified random sampling plan. Each of the ten bottles was sieved twice with a randomized run order.  This repetition 
measures  repeatability  of  the  technique  and  assesses  bottle-to-bottle  variation  in  the  particle  size  distribution.  
Mechanical sieving, using a Tyler Ro-Tap1, was done following recommendations in ASTM STP 447 [2].  The entire 
bottle of beads was poured onto the top sieve and the sieves were then shaken in the Ro-Tap for 15 min.  After the 
shaking was completed, the stack of sieves was disassembled, and the beads removed from each sieve and weighed to a 
precision of 0.01 g.  After weighing, all beads were returned to the original container and reused in Run 2.  The mass of 
beads retained on each sieve was used to calculate the mass percent finer than that sieve.  This is the ratio of the mass of 
beads passing through a sieve to the total starting mass.  For illustration purposes, the results of replicate sieving for each 
bottle (Runs “1” and “2”) are given in Table 3 as mass percent of beads passing through each successive sieve screen.  A 
graphical comparison of the mean of the five distributions obtained by SEM analysis with the mean of the twenty sieve 
analysis distributions is shown in Figure 3.  The diameter values for the sieve analyses were obtained by using the nominal 
ASTM mesh opening for each sieve. 
 
Table 4 shows an example comparison of the nominal sieve opening with the effective sieve size opening for sieves used 
at NIST.  This was determined by matching the mass fraction of beads passing through each sieve with the values in 
Table 1.    The  corresponding  diameter  from  Table 1 is then the effective sieve opening.  For example, the average 
percentage  passing  the  200 mesh  sieve  screen  for  all  bottles  tested  was  46.2 %.    Interpolation  between  the  46 % 
(74.6 µm) and 47 % (75.6 µm) values gives an effective opening of 74.8 µm.  This compares with the nominal opening of 
75 µm. Each of the effective diameters is well within the ASTM Specification [3] for permissible variation of average 
opening from the nominal sieve opening.  
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 
 
The entire bottle unit of beads should be used in any application of this SRM.  If this is impractical, special care must be 
exercised when taking subsamples from the SRM bottle.  The recommended procedure is to use a microriffler to divide 
the 43 g sample into subsamples until a suitable subsample mass is obtained.  Before and after the sieving procedure, 
weigh the sample mass to determine the mass of beads lost.  
 
Using Calibrated Glass Beads for the Evaluation of the Effective Opening of Test Sieves:  The allowed variation in 
sieve openings makes it difficult to compare size determinations made with different sets of sieves even though each set 
complies with the applicable ASTM, ANSI, or ISO test standard.  The aperture size of a sieve screen can be determined 
as the average size of the openings in the sieve.  However, the purpose of a sieve is to measure the size of particles and 
therefore, it is the effective opening that must be determined.  This effective opening is determined by the size of the 
calibrated glass spheres that will just pass through the sieve.  This in turn permits the measurement of the particle size of 
an unknown material that will also just pass through the sieve. 
 
The openings of a sieve are not all the same size, and particles that are coarser than the average opening can pass through 
the larger holes.  In addition, the separation achieved by a sieve is not sharp.  A few particles capable of passing the sieve 
are always retained.  Recognizing that the number of particles retained or passed depends on the manner and time of 
shaking, any measurement of the effective opening must take these variables into account.  To a large extent, the glass 
sphere method of calibration automatically includes these effects because the sieves are shaken in the same manner, 
when being calibrated, as when measuring an unknown material. 
 

                                                            

1 Certain commercial equipment, instruments, or materials are identified to specify adequately the experimental procedure.  
Such identification does not imply recommendation or endorsement by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, nor does 
it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the purpose.

The sieve openings are essentially square allowing particles of irregular shape to pass through although one dimension of 
the particle is considerably larger than the size of the opening.  Therefore, the average dimension of irregular particles 
that pass a sieve cannot be considered equal to the effective opening of the sieve as determined using SRM 1004b. 
 
To evaluate the effective opening of standard 203 mm (8 in) or 305 mm (12 in) diameter test sieves with this SRM, the 
entire bottle of beads should be poured onto the top sieve screen.  The sieves are then shaken in the same manner used in 
routine analysis.  To prevent blinding (overloading) of a screen, the beads should not be used with a single screen; 
typically two relief screens are needed to reduce the mass of beads.  An individual screen’s loading should be below six 
layers of beads at any given time (for use with 76 mm (3 in) test sieves, the mass of beads should be reduced with a 
spinning riffler). 
 
After shaking, the stack of sieves is disassembled, and the beads are removed from each sieve and placed into a suitable 
weighing container.  To reduce loss of material during this step, the transfer operation should utilize a large funnel or be 
carried out over glazed paper to recover any spillage.  A soft brush is useful in removing the beads from the sieve and 
funnel. 
 
Each of the sieve fractions is weighed to a precision of at least 0.01 g.  After weighing, all beads are returned to the 
original SRM bottle and kept for reuse.  The mass percent retained on each sieve is used to calculate the mass percent 
finer as the ratio of the mass of beads passing through a sieve to the total starting mass.  The effective size of the sieve 
opening is determined by interpolation between the nearest values given in Table 1. 
 
The above calibration procedure is for use in comparison testing of sieve results and as a method to systematically 
monitor for changes in sieve screens after service.  NIST calibrations of wire cloth sieves according to ASTM E 11 
specifications are available through the NIST Calibration Program at (301) 975-2200.
