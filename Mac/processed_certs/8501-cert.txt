Reference  Material  8501 
Report  of  Investigation 
A  Catalyst  Package  for  Lubricant  Oxidation  (ASTM  Sequence  IIE  Engine  Test) 
This  Reference  Material  (RM)  is  released  prior  to  the  corresponding  Standard  Reference  Material  to  provide  an  e 
access  to  the  Catalyst  Package  for  IIIE  Oxidation.  RM  8501  contains: 
(1)  an  oxidizedinitrated  fuel  fraction,  (2) 
& 
sitro-paraffin  model  compound,  (3)  a  metal  naphthenates  mixture,  and  (4)  distilled  water.  The  metal  naphthenate  mixture 
has  the  following  weight  rato  of  elements:  20:2:1:1 
RM  8501  is  used  to  simulate  the  chemical  environment  in  an  operating  automotive  engine,  specifically  under  the  ASTM 
sequence  IIIE  engine  test  conditions.  Seven  IIE  oils  have  been  tested  using RM  8501,  Both  the  modified  thin-film  oxyge 
uptake  test  (MTFOUT)  and  the  differential  scanning  calorimetry  (DSC)  test  were  used  to  determine  the  oxidation  induction 
times  of  these  oils  {1} 
The  correlation  between  the  values  for  oxidation  induction  times  by  MTFOUT  and  DSC  is  shown  in  Figure  1 
‘Notice  and Warning to  Users: 
Expiration  of  Report: 
date  of  purchase  and  shipment  from  NIST. 
Storage: 
Use:  Each  ampoule  should be  shaken  thoroughly  before  opening.  Samples  should  be  taken  immediately  after  opening  an 
ampoule  and  used  without  delay  in  order  to  maintain  the  integrity of  the  RM  sample,  Research  report  values  are  not  valid 
for  ampoules  that  have  been  opened  and  resealed, 
‘The  technical  planning,  coordination,  and  testing  leading  to  the  research  report  were  performed  by 
S.M.  Hsu,  Ceramic  Division, 
The  technical  and  support  aspects  involved  inthe  preparation,  data  analysis,  and  issuance  ofthis  Reference  Material  were 
coordinated  through  the  Standard  Reference  Materials  Program  by 
July  22,  1991

The  Report  of  Investigation  for  RM  8501  is  valid,  within  the  limits  certified,  for  one  year  from  the 

Sealed  ampoules,  as  received,  should  be  stored  in  the  dark  ata  temperature  between  10-25°C.

Preparation 

The  neutralized  product was  used  as  the  fuel  fraction  together  with  niteo-paraffin, 

uel  Fraction 
The  fuel  fraction  was  produced  by  the  oxidation/aiteation  of  a  high  boiling  VE:  gasoline  fraction  (ASTM  VE  engine  test 
ful)  [1]. 
The  total  acid  number  of  the 
fuel  fraction  of  RM  8501  was  determined  to  be 6.5  =  0.5  mg  KOHigm, 
Nitro-paraffin 
Model  Comp 
‘The  nitro-paraffin  model  compound  is  purchased  commercially.  The  stated  purity  of  the  nitro-paralfin  is
