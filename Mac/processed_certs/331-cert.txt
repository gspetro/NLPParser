Standard  Reference  Matenal  331 
Copper  Ore,  Mill  Tails 

This  material  is  in  the  form  of  fine  powder  intended  for  use  both  in  checking  cherucal  methods  of  analysis  and  in 
calibration  with  mstrumental  methods  of  analysis. 

This  SRM  is  issued  primarily  for  use  in  evaluation  of  the  critically  important  "material  balance"  in  the  copper 
mining  and  metallurgical  industries.

PLANHING,  PREPARATION,  TESTING,  ANALYSIS:  The  material  for  this  SRM  (331)  was  carefully  selected  and 
provided  to  NIST  by  Magma  Copper  Company,  San  Manuel, Arizona,  through  the  courtesy  of  T.L.  Young. 

At  MOST  this  material  was  sieved  and  thoroughly  blended,  which  mrrobred  several  independent  procechires. 

Anakyses  were  performed  in  the  MIST  Analytical  Chenustry  Division by  E.L.  Garner,  7.4".  Gramlich,  L.A.  Machlen, 
EJ.  Maenthal  JR.  Moock,  and  TJ.  Mhurphyy.

The  overall  direction  and  coordination  of  the  techrucal  measurements  at  MIST  leading  to  certification  were 
performed  under  the  direction  of  WR.  Shields  and  [.L.  Bames. 

The  technical  and  support  aspects  ivobred  in  the  original  preparation,  certification,  and  issuance  of  this  Standard 
Reference  Material  were  coordinated  through  the  Standard  Reference  Matenals  Program  by  RE.  Michaelis.

“Acid-  Soluble"  Copper 

  

The  total  copper  content  includes  "recoverable"  sulfide  copper  and  "nonrecoversble"  oxide  copper. 
Industrial 
practice  is  to  determine  "acid-soluble"  copper  ancdto  relate  this  result  to  the  ode  copper  content.  Investigation  at 
NIST  provided  additional  information  on  "acid-soluble"  copper  that  may be  useful,  but  is  not  certified:
