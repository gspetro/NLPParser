Photomask Linewidth Calibration Standard 
 
Serial Number Sample 
 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is a chrome-on-quartz photomask intended primarily for use in calibrating 
optical  microscopes  used  to  make  dimensional  measurements  on  antireflecting  chromium  integrated  circuit 
photomasks, and supersedes SRM 473 Optical Microscope Linewidth Standard [1].  SRM 2059 consists of patterns 
of  clear  and  opaque  isolated  lines  with  nominal  dimensions  ranging  from  0.25  μm  to  32.0  μm  and  line-spacing 
(pitch)  patterns  ranging  from  0.5  μm  to  250  μm  (see  Figure  1).   These  patterns  are  on  a  nominal  
152.4 mm × 152.4 mm × 6.35 mm (the industry standard 6.0 in × 6.0 in × 0.25 in) quartz substrate.   
 
Certified Values:  Certified values are given for isolated linewidths (both clear and opaque) and center-to-center 
line-spacings for one of the eight repeated patterns on the SRM as indicated by the pattern number given as the final 
digit of the serial number.  All measurements were averaged over the central 2 μm of each feature (at the horizontal 
fiducial line, also 2 μm wide to aid in tool setup), and the certification applies only to that portion of the feature.  
The certified values and their uncertainties are given in Tables I and II. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The materials used for this SRM, primarily quartz and chrome, are inherently stable.  
Consequently  the  certification  of  SRM  2059  is  valid  indefinitely,  within  the  measurement  uncertainty  specified, 
provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  given  in  this  certificate  (see 
“Instructions  for  Use”).   Periodic  recertification  is  not  required;  however,  this  certification  will  be  nullified  if  the 
SRM is damaged, contaminated, or modified. 
 
Maintenance of Certification:  NIST will monitor representative samples from this SRM lot over the period of its 
certification.  If substantive changes occur that affect the certification, NIST will notify the purchaser.  Registration 
(see attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
The overall preparation of this SRM was under the direction of J. Potzick. 
 
The  underlying  theory  and  the  optical  equipment  used  in  the  certification  of  the  NIST  photomask  SRMs  were 
developed and initially constructed by D. Nyyssonen of the NIST Precision Engineering Division.  Dr. Nyyssonen's 
model of optical image formation in the microscope has been significantly improved by M. Davidson [2−4] of the 
Spectel Research Corp., and this model was used in calibrating this SRM.  A wholly independent optical imaging 
model developed by E. Marx of NIST was used to verify these modeling results. 
 
The  equipment  for  automation  of  the  measurement  process  was  subsequently  designed,  constructed,  and 
programmed by J.E. Potzick, M. Pedulla, and M.T. Stocker of the NIST Precision Engineering Division.   
 
Measurements and data reduction were provided by M.T. Stocker and J.S. Jun of the NIST Precision Engineering 
Division.    Atomic  force  microscope  (AFM)  measurements  were  provided  by  R.G.  Dixson  of  the  NIST  Precision 
Engineering  Division.    Nien-Fan  Zhang  of  the  NIST  Statistical  Engineering  Division  provided  statistical  support.  
R. Larrabee and R. Silver provided additional advice and occasional encouragement.   
 
The  support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Measurement 
Services Division.

(a)Every pitch and isolated line feature on this SRM was measured at least 8 times on the NIST UV Microscope. The nominal and 
measured  values  of  all  of  the  calibrated  lines  and  spaces  are  listed  above,  in  micrometers.    The  expanded  (2σ)  calibration 
uncertainty for any linewidth or spacewidth feature is less than 26 nanometers. 

(b)Values for the C1 pitch pattern are in Table II.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE   
 
The  linewidth,  spacewidth,  and  pitch  measurands  are 
defined  in  Figure  2.   Pitch  measurements  are  center-to-
center  to  avoid  possible  confusion  from  inverting  or 
reversing the image in a microscope.  The patterns in Row 
F have not been calibrated. 
 
Only  one  of  the  eight  replicated  patterns  is  certified  at 
NIST, as noted in Table I.  The user is advised to transfer 
these  calibrations  to  one  or  more  of  the  other  patterns  on 
this  mask  for  routine  use,  as  insurance  against  damage  to 
the certified pattern. 
 
Use of this SRM in a scanning electron microscope is not 
recommended;  the  SRM  may  become  contaminated,  the 
material  profile  may  be  altered  and  charging  and  edge 
effects may invalidate the measurement. 
 
 
Handling  and  Storage:    Care  must  be  exercised  when 
handling  this  SRM.   Avoid  touching  the  surface  with  the 
microscope  objective  lens  while  setting  up  or  focusing.  
Only  non-abrasive  and  non-corrosive  cleaning  techniques 
should  be  used,  as  abrasives  and  acids  can  alter  the  line 
edges.    When  not  in  use,  SRM  2059  should  be  stored  in 
the photomask case supplied or equivalent. 
 
Certification  Technique:   All  measurements 
for 
certification  were  made  with  the  NIST  Ultraviolet  (UV) 
Microscope  Optical  Linewidth  Measurement  System  [5], 
which  is  a  photometric  transmission  microscope  with  a 
scanning 
measuring 
interferometer.   Except  for  the  setup  and  removal  of  the 
photomasks,  the  entire  calibration  process  is  automated.  
The performance of the system is assessed before and after 
each  calibration  by  measuring  features  on  a  control 
photomask.   These  control  measurements  include  center-
to-center 
that  have  been 
line  pairs 
Linescale 
to 
independently 
Interferometer.   Feature  widths  below  ~2  μm  were 
referenced to AFM measurements on the control mask, as 
described below. 
 
Linewidths  are  determined  from  the  image  profile  (image 
intensity  vs.  position  across  a  feature).   The  algorithm  for 
locating  the  position  on  the  image  profile  of  the  feature 
edge  is  derived  from  a  mathematical  model  of  the  optical 
microscope and is based on the theory of partial coherence 
imaging  [6−10].  Because  the  relative  brightness  of  an 
image  profile  at  this  edge  position  is  a  function  of  the 
physical and optical properties of the imaged object (the line), the calibration of a linewidth measurement system, 
by using this SRM, is valid only for measuring artifacts with physical and optical properties similar to the specific 
SRM used. 
 
Calibration Procedure for SRM 2059:    The scale of the UV Microscope (for both pitch and feature width) was 
calibrated  using  SRM  2800  Microscope  Magnification  Standard  [11],  traceable  to  the  NIST  Linescale 
Interferometer  [12].  The  line  and  space  features  on  SRM  2059  were  calibrated  using  a  combination  of  AFM  and 
optical microscope measurements; each technique was used where it has the lower measurement uncertainty.

All of the isolated linewidth and spacewidth features 8 μm and below on the control mask were measured by both 
techniques,  creating  a  kind  of  "Rosetta  Stone"  of  AFM  and  optical  values  for  the  same  features.   These  pairs  of 
measurements  tended  to  diverge  for  features  less  than  1  μm  and  coincide  for  features  greater  than  2  μm.    From 
these data, AFM equivalents of the optical values were derived and used for all subsequent measurements on all the 
photomasks:

feature was measured optically on the UV Microscope, but the smaller line and space features were referenced to 
the AFM measurements. 
 
Linewidth  and  Spacewidth  Calibration  Uncertainty:    The  measurements  on  this  SRM  are  traceable  to  the 
definition of the meter through the NIST Linescale Interferometer.  Some of the uncertainty components are listed 
in Tables III and IV.  These include repeatability and scale factor uncertainty, as well as parametric components

weighted  by  m  or  (1−m),  as  appropriate,  and  combined  as  described  in  reference  13  to  yield  the  expanded 
uncertainties, U, in Tables I and II:

The factor 2 is the "coverage factor" and ensures there is a 95 % probability that the true value lies within the range 
Measured Value ± U. 
 
Differential Uncertainty:  The difference between two linewidth or spacewidth values on the same mask is useful 
for  characterizing  the  linearity  of  a  linewidth  measuring  instrument.  The  uncertainty  of  this  difference,  Udiff,  has 
fewer  components  than  the  uncertainty  of  a  single  feature  width  because  feature-to-feature  parameter  differences 
like  Cr  n  and  k,  illumination  and  objective  numerical  apertures  (NAs),  etc.,  are  negligibly  small  (i.e.  these 
parametric  uncertainties  are  correlated).   The  largest  components  are  optical-to-AFM,  repeatability,  and  defocus 
effects.  These uncertainties are listed in Table IV as "Differential Unc":

For SRM 2059, it has been observed empirically that: 
 

for spaces   ≤ 1 μm, Udiff /U ≈ 0.8 
 
for lines   ≤ 1 μm, Udiff /U ≈ 0.7 
 
for lines and spaces   > 1 μm, Udiff /U ≈ 0.3 

 
The uncertainty of the difference between two lines or spaces on a single mask is then represented by the following

Chrome  Edge  Runout:   The  average  chrome  edge  profile  of  all  the  features  on  the  control  mask,  measured  by 
AFM,  is  shown  in  Fig. 3.  Feature-to-feature variations  were small compared to the average profile.  The chrome 
edge is taken here to be the "halfway up" point, which differs from the "halfway out" point by 0.6 nm.  Thus the 

 

SRM 2059 

Page 6 of 11 

 

 

"halfway out" linewidth is 1.2 nm smaller than reported in Table III, and the "halfway out" spacewidth is 1.2 nm 
greater. 
 
If the cross section is considered to be rectangular, then the edge can be assumed to lie anywhere within the 7.74 nm 
runout shown in Figure 3, with left and right edges mirror-image correlated, and the linewidth at the "halfway out" 
point.  Then the feature width uncertainty will be as described in references 13 and 14 as "Rectangular Edge Unc." 
See  the  references  for  a  discussion  of  the  relation  between edge runout and linewidth uncertainty.  Both Udiff and 
Urect are expanded (2σ) uncertainties.
