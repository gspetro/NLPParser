Reference Material 8385 
 
Ultra-High Molecular Weight Polyethylene Wear Particles 

 
This Reference Material (RM) consists of five ampoules cont aining five distinct wear particle populations generated by 
rubbing gamma-irradiated, ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) pins against textured chromium-
coated silicon surfaces with various sizes and shapes of mi cro-cutting edges.  Controlled  size and shape wear particles 
were generated by wear tests accordi ng to ASTM F-732 test method [1] in au
toclaved distilled water.  Three round 
particles with nominal diameters of 2 µm, 7 µm, and 12 µm and two elongated particles with nominal lengths of 9 µm 
and 18 µm and aspect ratios of 2 and 4, respectively, were  produced.  These narrowly distributed wear particles can be 
used for comparison purpose for retrieved particles analysis and for bioactivity testing.  The particles are packed into 5 ml 
amber, flame-sealed vials. 
 
Reference Values:   A NIST Reference value is a non-certified value that is the best estimate of the true value; 
however, the value does not meet NIST  criteria for certification and is provided with associated uncertainties that 
may reflect only measurement precision and may not include all sources of uncertainty [2].  The RM consists of five 
wear particle populations with distinct sizes and shapes.  Three particle populations are round in shape and two 
particles are elongated in shape.  Since the particles were  generated by a wear process, precise control of size and 
shape was not feasible.  Therefore, the particle size popula tion is characterized by the median of the particle size 
distribution (i.e., the particle size at which half of the population is larger and half of the population is smaller).  
Since the particle size distribution is skewed by design, the median is a better indicator of the particle size.  The 
references particle size population is given in Table 1. 
 
The particles are contained in an amber vial, flame-sealed under Argon atmosphere.  We certify that each ampoule 
contains at least a minimum number of 1 × 10 5 particles in distilled, autoclaved water containing HCl.  The water is 
controlled at a pH of 3.7, which is the approximate isoelectric point of the particles in water.

Support aspects involved with the certification and issuance of this RM were coordinated through the NIST 
Measurement Services Division. 
 
Maintenance of RM Certification:   NIST will monitor this RM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
changes occur that affect the reference values before the expiration of this report, NIST will notify the purchaser. 
Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification.  
 
Storage and Handling:   These ampoules should be stored in a cool, dark place to avoid ultra-violet light 
exposure, which may cause oxidation of the polymer.  
The ampoule should be opened in a clean, preferably 
sterile environment and sterilized immediately, either  by boiling water or immersed in a 50:50 alcohol to water 
solution before use.    
 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS1 
 
Material Acquisition and Preparation:   The ultra high molecular weight  polyethylene was from a reference 
material UHMWPE (GUR 415) obtained from The Hospital for Special Surgery (New York City, NY).  This 
material is an industrial standard with well-defined materi al properties.  Wear pins were machined from this stock 
and sent to Biomet Corporation (Warsaw, IN) for gamma
irradiation was performed to simulate, as close as possible, how the hip replacement material is fabricated and 
sterilized as well as to induce a reasonable level of cross-linking similar to the current orthopedic joint replacement 
part materials.  
 
Sterility:  The particles are NOT certified to be sterile and the user is encouraged to sterilize the particles before use 
in bioactivity tests.  However, ever y precaution has been taken to prevent extraneous particle contamination and 
each ampoule has been gamma irradiated at 28 kGy after  bottling to minimize potential  bio-contamination and to 
ensure stable shelf life.   
 
CAUTION:  Reference values are based on pre-irradiation data .  The process of irradiation may slightly increase 
the particle size. 
 
Packaging and Bottling:  The particles were packed into 5-ml ampoules by using the ampouling machine (Cozzoli 
Machine Company) at NIST.  Before packing, the particles were diluted in the purified water to a certain dilution 
rate. In order to pack the particles uniformly into the ampoules with the desired minimum particle number of  
1.0  × 10 5 per ampoule, the crucial issue was that the particles must disperse in the solution uniformly before the 
packing.  To solve this problem, the purified water, used as the packing solution, was adjusted via incorporation of 
HCl pH ≈ 3.7 (Zeta-potential measurement shows that the electric charging level of the generated particles tends to 
be zero as pH  ≈ 3.7) and mechanical energy was introduced by using a stirring device.  All the parts involved were 
cleaned with a 50:50 alcohol to water solution to provide a clean environment.  The ampoules were flame-sealed 
immediately after bottling. 
 
Generation of UHMWPE Particles:  
UHMWPE pins against textured surfaces in distilled, f
reciprocating wear machines.  The machines were cleaned  with a 50:50 solution of alcohol to water and covered 
by cleaned plastic films during operation.  
 
 

The wear particles were generated by rubbing gamma-irradiated 

iltered, and autoclaved water in several pin-on-disk

Statistical Analysis of Particle Size and Shape:   The particle size data were analyzed by the Statistics Engineering 
Division at NIST.  Since the particle size distribution is skewed and non-Gaussian, the sample median, defined as 
the particle size at which half of the population of particles  is larger and half of the population is smaller, is chosen 
to certify the particle populations in this certification.  The uncertainty for the sample median can be approximated 
by its asymptotic variance which is given by

where n is the sample size and f is the density function evaluated at median, h.  
 
Inter-quartile range (IQR) was used to measure the spread of size distribution, which describes the distance between 
the 25 % quartile and 75 % quartile, and provides a measure of the breadth of the interval within which 50  % of the 
particles are contained.

Information Values:   A NIST information value is considered to be a value that will be of interest and use to the 
RM user, but insufficient information is available to assess adequately the uncertainty associated with the value or 
only a limited number of analyses were performed.  Information values pertaining
analysis data are provided in Tables 2 and 3 for the 
median of the various ampoules from each particle is shown  with the estimated standard  error of the median.  The 
standard uncertainty includes both the variation in indivi dual sample medians (between-ampoule variation) and the 
uncertainty estimate based on bootstrap method (within-ampoule uncertainty); the expanded uncertainty interval (at 
95 % level) for the median of an average ampoule may be 
interpreted as the predictive intervals for median for a 
typical ampoule in the population.
