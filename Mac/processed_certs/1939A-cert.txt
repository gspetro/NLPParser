Certificate of Analysis 
 
Standard Reference Material® 1939a 

 
Polychlorinated Biphenyls Congeners in River Sediment A 

Congeners 

 
marily  for  use  in  validating 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is an air-dried river sediment.  It is intended primarily for use in validating 
analytical methods used in determining selected polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners in sediments.  All of the 
constituents  for  which  certified  and  reference  values  are  provided  in  SRM  1939a  are  naturally  present  in  the 
sediment material.  SRM 1939a is the same sediment material that was issued previously in 1990 as SRM 1939 [1].  
This material has been reanalyzed to provide updated certified values as well as certified and reference values for 
additional constituents.  A unit of SRM 1939a consists of a bottle containing approximately 50 g of sediment. 
 
Certified Concentration Values:  Certified values, expressed as mass fractions, are provided for 34 PCB congeners 
in Table 1.  The certified values for the PCB congeners are based on the agreement of results obtained from two or 
more  independent  analytical  techniques  [2].    A  NIST  certified  value  is  a  value  for  which  NIST  has  the  highest 
confidence in its accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or accounted for by 
NIST.  The measurand is the total concentration of each of the analytes in Table 1.  The ecrtified value is treaceable 
to the SI units for mass, expressed as mass fraction. 
 
Reference  Concentration  Values:    Reference  values,  also  expressed  as  mass  fractions,  for  30  additional  PCB 
congeners plus total PCBs, 5 chlorinated pesticides, and 7 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are provided in 
Tables  2,  3,  and  4,  respectively.    Reference  values  are  noncertified  values  that  are  the  best  estimates  of  the  true 
values.    However,  the  values  do  not  meet  the  NIST  criteria  for  certification  and  are  provided  with  associated 
uncertainties that may reflect only measurement precision, may not include all sources of uncertainty, or may reflect 
a lack of sufficient statistical agreement among multiple analytical methods.  The measurand is the concentration of 
each of the analytes in  2-4 as determined by the methods indicated in the text.  The certified value is treaceable to 
the SI units for mass, expressed as mass fraction. 
 
Expiration  of  Certification:    The  certification  of  SRM 1939a  is  valid,  within  the  measurement  uncertainty 
specified, until 31 October 2017, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given 
in this certificate (see “Instructions for Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, or 
otherwise modified.  
 
Maintenance  of  SRM  Certification:    NIST  will  monitor  this  SRM  over  the  period  of  its  certification.    If 
substantive  technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will 
notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Preparation  of  the  original  SRM   939  material  was  performed  by  R.M.  Parris  and  R.E.  Rebbert  of  the  NIST 
Chemical Sciences Division, and optical microscopy for the original certification was performed by J.A. Small of the 
NIST  Materials  Measurement  Science Division.  The analyses for the update of the certificate were performed by 
A. Guichard, J.R. Kucklick, B.J. Porter, D.L. Poster, and M.M. Schantz of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division.

Consultation  on  the  statistical  design  of  the  experimental  work  and  evaluation  of  the  data  was  provided  by 
S.D Leigh of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division. 
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Office  of  Reference 
Materials. 
 
NOTICE AND WARNING TO USERS 
 
of  unknown 
CAUTION:    This  material  is  a  naturally  occurring  river  sediment  and  may  contain  constituents  of  unknown 
toxicities; therefore, caution and care should be exercised during its handling and use. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 
 
Prior  to  removal  of  subsamples  for  analysis,  the  bottle  should  be  shaken.    Subsamples  for  analysis  of  this  SRM 
should be withdrawn from the bottle immediately after opening and used without delay for the certified values to be 
valid  within  the  stated  uncertainties.    The  bottle  should  be  tightly  closed  immediately  after  removal  of  the 
subsamples and the remaining material stored for later analyses.  The concentrations of constituents in SRM 1939a 
are  reported  on  a  dry-mass  basis.    The  SRM,  as  received,  contains  approximately  2.6  %  moisture.    A  separate 
subsample  of  the  SRM  should  be  removed  from  the  bottle  at  the  time  of  analysis  and  dried  to  determine  the 
concentration based on dry mass.  When not in use, the sediment should be stored in the dark at a temperature of 
25 °C or below. 
 
SOURCE AND PREPARATION(1) 
 
Source  of  Material:    The  sediment  material  from  which  this  SRM  was  prepared  was  donated  by  the  U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency, Environmental Monitoring and Support Laboratory, Cincinnati, Ohio. 
 
:  Hudson  River  in  New  York 
Sample  Collection and Preparation:  The sediment material was collected from the Hudson River in New York 
State.  It was dried, passed through a 325 mesh (45 µm) size sieve, and homogenized in a V-blender.  The material 
was  then  radiation  sterilized  (60Co)  at  an  estimated  minimum  dose of 3.2 megarads.  Approximate 50 g quantities 
were then transferred to amber bottles fitted with Teflon1 lined screw caps. 
 
Conversion to Dry Mass Basis:  The values for the constituents in SRM 1939a are reported on a dry-mass basis; 
however,  the  material  “as  received”  contains  residual  moisture.    The  amount  of  moisture  in  SRM  1939a  was 
determined  by  measuring  the  mass  loss  after  freeze-drying  subsamples  of  3 g  for  five  days  at  1 Pa  with  a  –10 °C 
shelf  temperature  and  a  –50 °C  condenser  temperature.    The  moisture  content  in  SRM  1939a  at  the  time  of  the 
recertification analyses was 2.56 % ± 0.16 % (95 % confidence). 
 
ANALYTICAL METHODS USED FOR THE ANALYTES OF INTEREST 
 
SRM 1939a was analyzed for selected analytes of interest by up to three methods using gas chromatography/mass 
spectrometry (GC/MS) on two columns with different selectivity.  For all of the methods described below, multipoint 
calibration  response  curves  for  the  compounds  of  interest  relative  to  the  internal  standards  were  determined  by 
processing gravimetrically-diluted solutions of appropriate SRMs (SRM 2259, SRM 2260a, SRM 2261, SRM 2262, 
SRM 2274, and/or SRM 2275) with the internal standards added. 
 
GC/MS (I):  For the GC/MS (I) analyses, duplicate subsamples of approximately 2 g from each of three bottles were 
extracted  using  pressurized  fluid  extraction  (PFE)  with  dichloromethane  (DCM).    The  analytes  of  interest  were 
isolated using a silica solid-phase extraction (SPE) column.  GC/MS analysis was performed on a 0.25 mm × 30 m 
fused-silica  capillary  column  containing  a  5 %  (mole  fraction)  phenyl  methyl-substituted  polysiloxane  phase 
(0.25 μm  film  thickness)  (HP-5MS,  Agilent  Technologies,  Wilmington,  DE).    SRM  2269,  SRM  2270,  PCB 103, 
PCB 198,  and  carbon-13  labeled  4,4′-DDE.  4,4′-DDT,  lindane,  and  trans-nonachlor  were  added  to  the  sediment 
prior to extraction for quantification purposes. 
 
GC/MS (II):  For the GC/MS (II) analyses, duplicated subsamples of approximately 1 g from each of three bottles 
Size  exclusion
(DCM). 
  Size  exclusion 
were  extracted  using  pressurized  fluid  extraction  (PFE)  with  dichloromethane  (DCM). 

                                                           
(1)  Certain  commercial  equipment,  instruments  or  materials  are  identified  in  this  certificate  to  adequately  specify  the 
 
experimental  procedure.    Such  identification  does  not  imply  recommendation  or  endorsement  by  the  National  Institute  of 
Standards and Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the 
purpose.

chromatography (SEC) with two columns in series (the first a 600 mm × 21.2 mm i.d. column with 10 μm particle 
diameter  pores)  was  used  to  remove  the  higher  molecular  mass  interferences,  as  well  as sulfur.  The concentrated 
extracts were then cleaned-up using alumina SPE columns.  GC/MS analysis was performed on a 0.25 mm × 60 m 
fused  silica  capillary  column  containing  a  5 %  phenyl  methyl-substituted  polysiloxane  phase  (0.25 μm  film 
thickness)  (DB-5MS,  Agilent  Technologies).    Carbon-13  labeled  PCB  28,  PCB  52,  PCB  77,  PCB  118,  PCB 126, 
PCB 153,  PCB 169,  PCB  180,  PCB  194,  and  PCB  206  were  added  to  the  sediment  prior  to  extraction  for 
quantification purposes. 
 
GC/MS (III):  For the GC/MS (III) analyses, duplicate subsamples of approximately 1 g from each of three bottles 
were Soxhlet extracted using DCM for 18 h.  Finely divided copper powder that had been acid-washed and solvent-
rinsed  was  added  to  the  round-bottom  flasks  to  remove  elemental  sulfur.    The  concentrated  extracts  were  then 
processed  through  a  precleaned  amino  SPE  column.    GC/MS  analysis  for  the  PCBs  was  performed  on  a 
0.25 mm × 60 m fused silica capillary column containing a nonpoloar proprietary polysiloxane phase (0.25 μm film 
thickness) (DB-XLB, Agilent Technologies) while GC/MS analysis for the pesticides and PAHs was performed on a 
25 mm  ×  60  m  fused  silica  capillary  column  containing  a  50%  phenyl  methyl-substituted  polysiloxane  phase 
(0.25 μm  film  thickness)  (DB-17,  Agilent  Technologies)      SRM  2269,  SRM  2270,  PCB  30,  PCB  103,  PCB 198, 
PCB 204, carbon-13 labeled lindane, 4,4′-DDE and cis-nonachlor were added to the sediment prior to extraction for 
quantification purposes. 
 
GC/MS (IV):  For the GC/MS (IV) analyses, duplicate subsamples of approximately 1.5 g from each of three bottles 
were extracted using PFE with DCM.  Finely divided copper powder that had been acid-washed and solvent-rinsed 
was  added  to the round bottom flasks to remove elemental sulfur.  The concentrated extracts were then processed 
through a precleaned amino SPE column.  GC/MS analysis was performed on a 25 mm x 60 m fused silica capillary 
column  containing  a  50%  phenyl  methyl-substituted  polysiloxane  phase  (0.25  μm  film  thickness) (DB-17, Agilent 
Technologies).    SRM  2269  and  SRM  2270  were  added  to  the  sediment  prior  to  extraction  for  quantification 
purposes. 
 
Total PCBs:  The data for total PCBs was combined from three methods: GC/MS (I) where the total PCB value was 
determined  by  summing  the  PCBs  by  chlorine  group,  GC/MS  (II)  where  the  total  PCB  value  was  a  sum  of  the 
congener  concentrations,  and  GC/MS  (III)  where  the  total  PCB  value  was  also  the  sum  of  the  congener 
concentrations. 
 
Particle Size:  SRM 1939a was examined by optical microscopy and found to be homogenous with respect to the 
distribution of particle size both within and between SRM units.

(a) PCB congeners are numbered according to the scheme proposed by Ballschmiter and Zell [4] and later revised by Schulte and 
Malisch [5] to conform with IUPAC rules.  For the congeners listed, the differences are PCB 201 (BZ#) is PCB 199 in the 
IUPAC nomenclature and PCB 199 (BZ#) is PCB 200 in the IUPAC nomenclature.  When two or more congeners are known 
to coelute under the conditions used, the PCB congener listed first is the major component and the additional congeners may 
be present as minor components.  The quantitative results are based on the response of the congener listed first. 

(b) Concentrations reported on dry mass basis; material as received contains approximately 2.6 % moisture. 
(c) Certified  values  are  unweighted  means  of  the  results  for  two  or  three  data  sets.    The  uncertainty  listed  with  the  value  is  an 
expanded uncertainty about the mean, with coverage factor 2, calculated by combining a between-method variance [6] with a 
pooled, within-method variance following the ISO/JCGM and NIST Guides [3].

Table 3.  Reference Concentrations (Mass Fractions) for Selected Chlorinated Pesticides in SRM 1939a (a,b) 
 

(a) Concentrations reported on dry-mass basis; material as received contains approximately 2.6 % moisture. 
(b) Reference values are unweighted means of the results for two or three data sets.  The uncertainty listed with the value is an 
expanded uncertainty about the mean, with coverage factor 2, calculated by combining a between-method variance [6] with a 
pooled, within-method variance following the ISO/JCGM and NIST Guides [3].
