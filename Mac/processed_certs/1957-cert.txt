This Standard Reference Material  (SRM)  is intended for use in evaluating analytical methods for the determination of 
selected  polychlorinated  biphenyl (PCB)  congeners,  chlorinated  pesticides,  and  polybrominated  diphenyl 
ether (PBDE)  congeners  in  human  serum  and  similar  matrices.    Reference  values  are  provided  for  selected 
perflourinated 
polychlorinated 
compounds (PFCs),  and serum lipid.   Information  values are provided for  selected hydroxylated compounds .  All  of 
the constituents for which values are provided in SRM 1957  are naturally present in the freeze-dried  human serum.  A 
unit of SRM 1957  consists of five 30  mL  vials each containing freeze-dried  non-fortified human serum.   Before  use, 
the serum in each vial must be reconstituted with 10.7  mL  of distilled or HPLC-grade  water.  
 
The  development  of  SRM 1957  was  a  collaboration  between  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and 
Technology (NIST)  and the Division  of Laboratory  Sciences, Organic  Analytical  Toxicology  Branch,  U.S.  Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 
 
Certified  Mass  Fraction  Values:    Certified  values,  expressed  as  mass  fractions,  for  selected  PCB  congeners, 
chlorinated  pesticides, and  PBDE  congeners along  with  one  polybrominated  biphenyl  congener  are  provided  in 
Tables 1,  2,  and 3, respectively.  A NIST  certified  value is a value for which  NIST  has the highest confidence in its 
accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [1].  The certified 
values for  the PCB  congeners , chlorinated  pesticides, and PBDE  congeners are based on the agreement  of results 
obtained  at  NIST  using  one  or  more  analytical  techniques and  additional  results  from  the  CDC  and  from  an 
interlaboratory study using different analytical  techniques.  Values are reported based on the reconstituted serum in 
mass fraction units [2].   
 
Reference  Mass  Fraction  Values:    Reference  values,  expressed  as  mass  fractions,  are  provided  in  Table 4  for 
additional  PCB  congeners , chlorinated pesticides, and PBDE  congeners; Table 5  for  selected PFC  compounds; and 
Table 6  for  selected  PCDD  and  PCDF  congeners .    Reference  values  for  serum  lipids  are  provided  in  Table 7.   
Reference values are noncertified values that are estimates of the true value; however, the values do not meet the NIST 
criteria  for certification  and are provided with  associated uncertainties that may  reflect  only measurement  precision, 
may  not include all  sources of uncertainty, or may  reflect  a lack  of sufficient  statistical agreement  among  multiple 
analytical methods [1].   Values  are reported based on the reconstituted serum in mass fraction units  [2]. 
 
Information  Mass Fraction  Values:  Information  values for mass fractions of selected hydroxylated compounds  and 
Aroclor 1260  are provided in Table 8.  An information  value is considered to be a value that will  be of  interest to the 
SRM user, but insufficient information  is available to assess the uncertainty associated with the value or only a limited 
number  of  analyses were  performed  [1].    Values  are  reported  based on  the  reconstituted serum  in  mass  fraction 
units [2].   Information  values cannot be used to assess metrological traceability.   
 
Expiration  of Certification:   The certification  of SRM  1957 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until  31 August 2025,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  instructions  given  in  this 
certificate  (see “Instructions for Stability,  Storage, and Use”).   The certification  is nullified  if  the SRM  is damaged, 
contaminated, or otherwise modified.   
 
Overall  direction and coordination of technical measurements leading to certification  were performed  by J.L.  Reiner, 
L.C.  Sander, M.M. Schantz, and S.A. Wise of the NIST  Chemical  Sciences Division.

NOTICE  AND  WARNING  TO  USERS 
 
SRM  1957  IS  INTENDED  FOR  RESEARCH  USE.    THIS  IS  A  HUMAN  SOURCE  MATERIAL.    HANDLE 
PRODUCT  AS  A  BIOHAZARDOUS  MATERIAL  CAPABLE  OF  TRANSMITTING  INFECTIOUS  DISEA SE.   
The  supplier  has reported  that  each  donor unit  of  plasma  used in  the  preparation  of  this  product was  tested  by 
FDA-licensed  tests and found to be negative for  human immunodeficiency  virus  (HIV),  HIV-1  antigen, hepatitis B 
surface antigen, and hepatitis C.  However, no known test method can offer complete assurance that hepatitis B virus, 
hepatitis C  virus, HIV,  or other infectious agents are absent from  this material.   Accordingly, this human blood-based 
product should be handled at the Biosafety Level 2 or higher as recommended for any POTENTIALLY  INFECTIO US 
HUMAN  SERUM  OR  BLOOD  SPECIMEN  in the CDC/National  Institutes of Health (NIH)  Manual [3].    
 
INSTRUCTIONS  FOR  STABILITY,  STORAGE,  AND  USE 
 
Stability  and  Storage:  The serum is freeze-dried  and should be stored in a refrigerator  at temperatures between 2 °C 
and 8 °C until ready for use.  It should not be frozen or exposed to sunlight or ultraviolet radiation.  After reconstitution, 
the contents should be used immediately  or stored between 2 °C  and 8 °C  until ready for  use, preferably within  4 h.  
Freezing  of the reconstituted material  is not recommended. 
 
Use:   Bring  the vial to room temperature,  remove the metal  closure, and lightly tap the bottom of the vial to dislodge 
any dried  serum particles  from  the stopper.  Carefully  remove  the stopper to avoid possible loss of serum particles.  
Use a dispenser of known accuracy to slowly add 10.7  mL  of distilled  or HPLC-grade  water at 20  °C  to 25 °C  to the 
sides of the vial while  continually turning the vial.  Replace the stopper, swirl the vial two or three times, and let stand 
for approximately  10  min.   Mix  contents by gently swirling,  let stand for approximately  30  min,  swirl  again, let stand 
10  min,  and finally  invert the vial several times.   Do not shake vigorously because this will  cause frothing.  Total time 
for reconstitution is approximately  1 h.  After reconstituting, use contents as soon as possible or store between 2 °C 
and 8 °C until analysis, preferably within 4 h. 
 
PREPARATION  AND  ANALYSIS (1) 
 
Source  of  Material:    Plasma  was  acquired  from  various blood banks located  around the U.S.:    Wilmington  and 
Greenville,  NC;  Jacksonville  and  Orlando,  FL;  Jonesboro, AR;  Flagstaff, AZ;  Gallup  and  Albuquerque, NM; 
Memphis, TN; Portland, ME; and Carbondale,  IL. 
 
Preparation  of  Material: 
  Preparation  of  the  serum  was  performed  by  Aalto  Scientific,  Ltd.,  Carlsbad , CA.   
Following  the precipitation of fibrin  and filtration,  the s erum was pooled (approximately  200  L  total) and was stored 
at 4 °C.   The pool was split into two for production of  SRMs 1957  and 1958.   Using a calibrated automatic  pipette, 
10.7  mL  aliquots of  serum  were  dispensed into 30  mL  amber  glass vials.   The samples  were  lyophilized  and were 
considered dry when a stable vacuum and temperature were  achieved.

ANALTYICAL  METHODS  USED  AT  NIST   
 
For NIST  Method 1, the freeze-dried  serum in each of ten vials was reconstituted by adding 10.7  mL  (mass known) 
of HPLC-grade  water.  A known amount of internal standard solution  (containing selected 13C-labeled PCB  congeners, 
selected 13C-labeled pesticides, 13C-labeled PBDE  209,  fluorinated  PBDE  47,  PCB  103,  and PCB  198)  was added to 
each vial,  which  was sonicated for  15 min  and allowed  to equilibrate  overnight under refrigeration.   After samples 
were  removed  from  refrigeration  and allowed  to reach ambient  temperature,  10  mL  of  formic  acid  was added, as a 
denaturation agent,  followed  immediately  by  10  mL  of  a  1:1  (volume  fraction)  mixture  of  n-hexane  and  methyl 
Ccentrifugation to obtain a sharp phase boundary, the upper organic phase was transferred to a concentration vessel.  
The extraction was repeated twice with 10 mL  of n-hexane each time.   The combined hexane layers were concentrated 
using an automated evaporation system to approximately  4 mL.   Approximately  2 mL  of concentrated sulfuric acid 
was added to the concentration vessel with swirling.   Following  phase separation, the hexane phase was removed, and 
the sulfuric  acid  phase was  washed twice  using  4 mL  portions of  n-hexane.    The  combined  hexane  phases were 
concentrated to approximately  0.5  mL  for silica  solid-phase extraction  (SPE)  clean-up.  The fraction of interest was 
eluted with  15  mL  of 10  % (volume  fraction)  dichloromethane  in hexane.   The concentrated samples were  analyzed 
using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS)  operated in both the electron impact  (EI)  and negative ion 
chemical  ionization  (NICI)  mode.  A 0.25  mm  × 60 m fused silica capillary column containing a non-polar proprietary 
phase (DB-XLB,  Agilent Technologies, Wilmington,  DE)  0.25  µm  film  thickness was used for the EI  analysis  (NIST 
Method 1a)  while  a  0.25  mm  × 60  m 
fraction) 
phenyl-substituted  methylpolysiloxane  phase (DB-17MS,  Agilent  Technologies)  was  used  for 
the  NICI 
analysis (NIST  Method 1b).  All  injections were 1 µL  using an on-column inlet. 
 
For NIST  Method 2,  the freeze-dried  serum  in each of six  vials was reconstituted by adding 10.7  mL  (mass known) 
of HPLC-grade  water.  A known amount of internal standard solution (containing selected 13C-labeled PCB congeners, 
selected 13C-labeled pesticides, 13C-labeled PBDE  209,  and selected fluorinated PBDE  congeners) was added to a 2 g 
serum  subsample from  each vial,  vortexed,  and allowed  to equilibrate  overnight under refrigeration.   After samples 
were removed from  refrigeration  and allowed  to reach ambient  temperature, 2 mL  of formic  acid was added followed  
by 3 mL  of  20 % (volume  fraction)  dichloromethane in  hexane.    Samples  were  extracted  using focused microwav e 
extraction.    Following  extraction,  samples were  centrifuged, the organic  phase was removed,  and another 3 mL  of 
20  % (volume  fraction)  dichloromethane in hexane was added.  The extraction  was repeated, and the organic phases 
were  combined.    Following  concentration with  a  solvent exchange  to  iso-octane,  samples  were  cleaned-up  on a 
sulfuric-acid  silica  column  followed  by  clean-up  on  an  alumina  column  (5 %  deactivated).   The  eluant  from  the 
clean-up  columns was  concentrated to 0.2  mL  with  a solvent change to iso-octane for  analysis.   The concentrated 
samples were analyzed using GC/MS  in the EI mode (NIST  Method 2a) with a 0.18  mm  × 30  m fused silica  capillary  
fraction)  phenyl-substituted  methylpolysiloxane  phase (DB-5MS,  Agilent 
column  containing  a  5 %  (mole 
Technologies)  0.18  µm 
temperature 
injections  were  20  µL  using  a  programmable 
vaporization (PTV)  inlet.   For NIST  Method 2b, the same extracts,  same column,  and PTV  inlet were  used with the 
GC/MS  in the NICI  mode.  For NIST  Method 2c, the same extracts were analyzed by GC/MS  in the NICI  mode using 
on-column  injection  into  a  0.18  mm  × 10  m  fused  silica  capillary  column  containing  a  5 % (mole  fraction) 
phenyl-substituted methylpolysiloxane phase (DB-5MS,  Agilent Technologies), 0.18  µm  film  thickness. 
 
For NIST  Method 3, the freeze-dried  serum in each of six  bottles was reconstituted by adding 10.7  mL  (mass known) 
of HPLC-grade  water.  A known amount of internal standard solution (containing selected 13C-labeled hydroxylated 
compounds) was added to each vial, vortexed, and allowed to equilibrate overnight under refrigeration.  After samples 
were  removed  from  refrigeration  and allowed  to  reach  ambient  temperature,  2 mL  of  formic  acid  and  0.5  mL  of 
6 mol/L  hydrochloric  acid (HCl)  were  added  to  the  serum  sample  followed  by  2 mL  of  20  % (volume  fraction) 
dichloromethane  in  hexane.    Samples  were  extracted  using focused microwave  extraction.    Fo llowing  extraction, 
samples  were  centrifuged,  the  organic  phase  was  removed,  and  another  3 mL  of  20  % (volume  fraction) 
dichloromethane  in  hexane  was  added.    The  extraction  was  repeated,  and  the  organic  phases were  combined.   
Potassium hydroxide (KOH)  was then added to the organic phase.  The samples were shaker-extracted for 15 min  and 
centrifuged,  and  the  KOH  was  removed.    This  step  was  repeated  two  times  and  the  KOH  phases combined.   
HCl  (6 mol/L)  was added to the KOH  phases, followed by 2 mL  20  % (volume  fraction) dichloromethane in hexane.   
The hexane phase was removed, and this step was repeated two times  combining the hexane phases.  A silica column  
was  used  for  clean-up  followed  by  analysis  using  liquid  chromatography  coupled  to  a  triple  quadrupole  mass 
spectrometer (LC/MS/MS)  using  a  C18 column  (Agilent  Eclipse  Plus C18,  3.0  mm  × 150  mm  × 3.5  μm,  Agilent 
Technologies) with a methanol-water  gradient.

For NIST  Method 4, the freeze-dried  serum in each of five bottles was reconstituted by adding 10.7  mL  (mass known) 
of  HPLC-grade  water.   A known  amount  of internal  standard solution (containing selected  13C-labeled  PFCs)  was 
added to a 0.15  g serum subsample from  each vial,  vortexed, and allowed  to equilibrate overnight under refrigerated  
conditions.   After  samples were  removed  from  refrigeration  and allowed  to reach  ambient  temperature,  0.6  mL  of 
50  % (volume  fraction) formic  acid in water  was added, and the samples were  loaded onto 60 mg  Oasis WAX SPE 
columns (Waters, Milford,  MA).   Compounds of  interest were  eluted off  the columns using methanol  followed  by 
2 mL  of 1  % (volume  fraction) ammonium  hydroxide  in methanol.  Following  concentration, samples were analyzed 
using  LC/MS/MS  with  a  C8  column  (Thermo  Betasil  C8,  100  mm  × 2.1  mm  × 5 μm,  Thermo  Fisher  Scientific, 
Waltham,  MA) and methanol-ammonium  acetate in water gradient. 
 
For  all  of  the NIST  methods, multi-point  calibration  response curves for  the compounds of  interest relative  to the 
internal  standards were  determined  by  processing  gravimetrically  diluted  solutions  of  SRM 2261  Chlorinated 
Pesticides  in  Hexane (Nominal  Mass  Concentration 2 µg/mL),  SRM  2262  Chlorinated Biphenyl  Congeners  in 
2,2,4-Trimethylpentane (Nominal Mass Concentration 2 µg/mL), SRM 2274  PCB Congener Solution-II in Isooctane, 
and SRM 2275  Chlorinated Pesticide Solution-II in Isooctane plus gravimetrically prepared solutions of the additional 
analytes of interest with  the internal  standards added.  SRM 1589a  PCBs, Pesticides, PBDEs,  and Dioxins/Furans in 
Human Serum was analyzed with each set of samples as a quality control material. 
 
ANALTYICAL  METHODS  USED  AT  CDC 
 
For  the analytes other than PFCs,  details  for  the  analytical  methods  used at  CDC  can  be  found in  Patterson and 
Turner [3]  and  Sjödin  et  al.  [4].    In  summary,  the  freeze-dried  serum  was  reconstituted by  adding  10.7  mL  of 
HPLC-grade  water and mixing.   The samples were  stored overnight at 5 °C.   Sample  extraction was performed  using 
a C18  SPE  method.  After addition of the internal standard solution and formic  acid, th e sample  was eluted through 
an SPE  column  using appropriate solvents.  The eluant was  then cleaned -up using a Universal  Prep  system (Fluid  
Management Systems, Waltham, MA) containing an acid/neutral/base silica column, an alumina  column, and a carbon 
column.   Corresponding 13C-labeled compounds were used as internal standards for the majority  of the analytes.   
 
Gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC/HRMS)  with mass resolution of 10  000  was used for the

methylpolysiloxane  phase (DB-5MS,  J&W  Scientific,  Folsom,  CA),  0.25  µm  film  thickness.    All  injections  were 
splitless with helium  as the carrier  gas. 
 
For  determination  of  the  PFCs,  the  freeze-dried  serum  in  each  of  three  bottles  was  reconstituted  by  adding 
10.7  mL  (mass known)  of  HPLC-grade  water.    A known  amount of  internal  standard solution containing selected 
13C-labeled PFCs was added to two 0.2  mL  serum subsamples from  each vial along with 0.5  mL  of 0.1  mol/L  formic 
acid.  The samples were sonicated for 20 min  and placed on an on-line SPE-HPLC  system.  The samples were loaded 
onto C18  SPE  cartridges, and the compounds of interest were  eluted off the cartridges directly  into the LC/MS/M S 
with  separation  on  a  C8 column  (Thermo  Betasil  C8,  50  mm  × 3 mm  × 5 μm,  ThermoHypersil-Keystone, 
Bellefonte,  PA) using a gradient of methanol and ammonium  acetate in water. 
 
INTERLABORATORY  STUDY 
 
The four laboratories participating in the interlaboratory study used their usual methods for these analyses.  Not every 
laboratory reported data for every analyte.  When more than one laboratory did report data for a part icular analyte, the 
mean of the results was used for combination with other data to assign the certified and reference mass fraction values.  
 
Total  Cholesterol  and  Associated  Analytes:   The reference mass fractions total cholesterol and triglycerides were  
determined using standard enzymatic  methods by the CDC  and the Institut national de santé publique du Québec.  In 
the cholesterol analysis, the esters were first cleaved (using cholesterol esterase), and then the total serum cholesterol 
was measured by a cholesterol oxidase - peroxidase method.  The absorbance of the resulting chromophore at 540  nm 
is directly  proportional to total cholesterol.   “Free”  cholesterol  was measured by an enzymatic  method similar  the 
method for total cholesterol but did not include the cholesterol esterase.  In the triglyceride  analysis, glycerides were 
hydrolyzed with  a fungal  lipase and the liberated  glycerol  was estimated  from  the rate  of change in  absorbance at 
340  nm.    No  corrections  were  made  for  the  free  glycerol  content  o f  the  serum.    Serum  choline-containing 
phospholipids were also measured by an enzymatic method in which the phospholipids are hydrolyzed to free choline 
by phospholipase D.

(a) The total lipids in the serum may be calculated  from:  TL = 1.677  (TC – FC) + FC + TG + PL, where TL is total lipids, TC is 
total cholesterol, FC is free cholesterol, TG is triglycerides,  and PL is phospholipids.  The constant 1.677 is based on fatt y acid 
analysis of serum cholesterol esters and has been described elsewhere [13,14].  Based on this calculation,  the mass fraction of 
total lipids in SRM  1957 is 533 mg/dL. 

(b) The reference  mass  fraction value  is a  weighted  mean  of the mass  fractions determined  by two methods (CDC  and Institut 
national  de  santé  publique  du  Québec) [8].    The  uncertainty listed  with  each  value  is  an  expanded  uncertainty  about  the 
mean [8,9],  with coverage  factor,  k = 2,  calculated  by combining  a  pooled within  method variance  with a  between method
