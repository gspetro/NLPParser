Reference Material 8480 
 
Secondary Ferrite Number Standard - Low Range 
 
SAMPLE 
Serial No:   SAMPLE 
 
This Reference Material (RM) is intended for the calibration of instruments used to measure weld metal ferrite content 
ntent 
in  accordance  with  American  National  Standards  Institute (ANSI),  American  Welding  Society (AWS)  and 
International Standards Organization (ISO) normative standards ANSI/AWS A4.2 and ISO 8249 [1,2].  The ferrite 
made 
content is measured in terms of a method defined quantity, the Ferrite Number (FN).  NIST measurements were made 
in accordance with ANSI/AWS A4.2 [1]. 
 
Description  and  Source  of  Material:    Each  RM  unit  is  a  set  of  eight  individually  measured  specimens.    Each 
specimen  is  approximately  10 mm × 12 mm × 20 mm  and  has  an  identification  number  scribed  on  one  of  the 
12 mm × 20 mm  faces.  The  measurement  surface is the  face opposite the surface that  contains the  identification 
number.  RM 8480 comprises eight specimens having FN values ranging from 0 FN to 30 FN.  The related RM 8481 
Secondary Ferrite Number Standard - High Range, comprises eight specimens having FN values ranging from 30 FN 
to 120 FN. 
 
The  RM  was  made  from  centrifugal  castings  of  chromium-nickel  steel  alloys.    The  ferrite  content  was  varied  by 
adjusting the composition of the alloy.  The cast specimens approximate the ferrite distribution in a weld deposit and 
have a solidification structure similar to that of  welds [3].  Like the ferrite in  welds, the magnetic response of the 
ferritic (magnetic) phase varies with alloy composition.  The homogeneity of the cast material was demonstrated to 
be sufficient for use as secondary FN standards [4]. 
 
Metrological Traceability:  The measurand is ferrite number and is intended for the calibration of instruments used to 
measure weld metal ferrite content in accordance with ANSI, AWS, and ISO normative standards ANSI/AWS A4.2 and 
ISO 8249[1,2]. 
 
Expiration  of  Value  Assignment:    RM 8480  is  valid  indefinitely,  within  the  measurement  uncertainty  specified, 
provided  the  RM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  instructions  given  in  this  Report  of  Investigation (see 
“Instructions for Handling, Storage and Use”).  Periodic validation of this RM is not required.  This report is nullified 
if the RM is damaged, contaminated, or otherwise modified.  
 
Material Maintenance:  NIST will monitor this RM over the period of its validity. If substantive technical changes 
occur  that  affect  the  value  assignment  before  the  expiration  of  this  report,  NIST  will  notify  the  purchaser. 
Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Overall direction and coordination of the technical measurements leading to certification were performed by F. DelRio 
of  the  NIST  Applied  Chemicals  and  Materials  Division.    FN  measurements  and  analysis  were  managed  by 
C.N. McCowan of the NIST Applied Chemicals and Materials Division.  Statistical support was provided by J. Wang 
of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division. 
 
Support aspects involved in issuance of this RM were coordinated through the NIST Office of Reference Materials.

RM 8480 

 
Centrifugal castings were manufactured by Merinov Enterprises (formerly the Mladis Co., Moscow, Russia). 
 
NIST Measurement Procedure:  The FN measurements were made with a Magne-Gage-type instrument( 1) using a 
#3 magnet, as specified by ANSI/AWS 4.2 [1].  Measurements were made on each specimen in the RM unit in five 
positions by two operators using two gages.  As shown in Figure 1, the five positions are clustered about the center of 
the specimen face.  At each position, five measurements were made by each operator using each gage.  The lowest 
repeatable measurement of the five was retained in accordance with ANSI/AWS 4.2 (to screen out measurements for 
which the magnet detaches prematurely).  In total, 100 measurements were made on each specimen, but only 20 are 
used in the calculation of the FN value. 
 
 

  

    
  

Figure 1.  Measurements were made in the five positions shown, on 
the face of the specimen opposite to the identification number. 

 
 
Uncertainty Analysis:  The RM consists of eight individually measured specimens.  Table 1 provides three columns 
of data on each specimen: the mean and standard uncertainty for position 5 of the specimen, pooled statistics from all 
five positions on the specimen, and grand means and standard uncertainties for all five positions.  The data for position 
5 is given as the reference value in accordance with normative standards [1,2]. The pooled statistics and grand averages 
are provided in Table 1 for information only to more fully describe the variation in FN measurement within a specimen.  
The pooled statistics combine information from each gage-operator combination.  The data used to generate the grand 
mean considered every measurement as an individual observation regardless of gage, operator, or position. 
 
Measurement Repeatability (uR):  The Type A uncertainty in FN measurements taken at a single location (position 5) 
is due to differences in operators, gages, and magnets used on the gages.  uR is given in Table 1. 
 
Calibration Error (uC):  The Type B uncertainties in FN measurements due to sources of bias include: (1) uncertainty 
due to variation in the thickness of the coating thickness standards (SRMs 1321, 1363a and 1364a) used to calibrate 
the gage, (2) uncertainty of the dial readings on the gage, and (3) uncertainty related to the fit of the calibration curve. 
 
The calibration error shown in Figure 2 was determined by simulation.  A triangular distribution (± 0.5) was used to 
model the error of the dial readings from the gage.  The root mean square error of the calibration result, based on 
10 000 Monte Carlo samples, was used as the standard uncertainty for the calibration error. 
 
Combined Uncertainty (u):  The two standard uncertainties (uR and uC) can be combined by quadrature addition to 
obtain  the  overall  standard  uncertainty (combined  uncertainty).    To  determine  the  overall  uncertainty  for  a  given 
specimen, the standard uncertainty for the specimen in Table 1 and the calibration error estimated for the FN level of 
the specimen in Figure 2 are combined using Equation 1.

Pooled  Uncertainty (up):    The  lowest  repeatability  estimate  is  expected  for  measurements  performed  by  the  same 
operator using the same gage.  This within-specimen uncertainty is a good indicator of material homogeneity.  These 
values are deemed particularly characteristic of the specimen when the uncertainties for the four conditions (two gages 
and two operators) show similar variation.

The mean and standard uncertainties for  measurements  made at a single location (Position 5, reported in Table 1) 
include uncertainty due to the differences between the gages and operators.  These values are the best indicator of how 
closely a user measuring the standard might expect to match the NIST measurement at a given location.   
 
The pooled estimate of the variation in the specimen, up reported in Table 1, was calculated using Equation 2,

where u1 to u4 are the standard uncertainties calculated for the five measurements at each of the four operator-gage 
combinations.    This  statistic  best  characterizes  the  overall  variation  in  the  FN  due  to  local  variations  in  the 
microstructure of each specimen.  
 
The grand mean and standard uncertainty for the 20 measurements made on each specimen reported in Table 1 provide 
uncertainty 
NIST’s best overall estimate of the FN, and variation in FN that includes all contributions of measurement uncertainty 
and specimen homogeneity. 
 
DLING,  STORAGE,  AND  USE 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
Handling  and  Storage:    Do  not  expose  the  RM  to  magnetic  fields,  temperatures  outside  the  range  of  –40 °C  to 
+40 °C,  or  corrosive  atmospheres  or  solvents.    Avoid  mechanical  damage  or  material  removal (e.g.,  grinding  or 
polishing) of the measurement face of the RM.  Store the RM in the case provided when not in use. 
 
Use:  To calibrate an instrument in the range covered by RM 8480, measure the ferrite number at the center of the 
measurement face (Position 5, see Figure 1) of each specimen supplied.  The measurement face is opposite the face 
on which the specimen identification number is scribed.  Consult the instrument user’s manual and current normative 
standards for procedural specifics and data analysis [1,2].  For the purposes of many users, the Position 5 mean FN 
value (Table 1) will be the value used to calibrate or verify their instrument. 
 
Specimens may be wiped clean before measurement using a soft cloth to free the surface of dust.  A mild detergent 
solution or solvent such as isopropyl alcohol may also be used to clean the surface of any contaminants.
