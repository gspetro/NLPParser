This Standard Reference Material (SRM ) is intended primarily for use in the determination of sheet resistance and 
bulk resistivity using the DC four-point probe method [1 ,2].  SRM 2541 is a nominal 100 mm diameter Czochralski-
grown, boron-doped silicon wafer with (100) crystallogra
utilizing a simultaneous two-sided lapping process with a nominal 12 µm aluminum oxide abrasive.  
 
This wafer unit was individually measured.  The certified sheet  resistance and resistivity values at the wafer’s center 
are given in Table 1a and the sheet resistance is given at  60° increments on the radii of 5 mm and 10 mm circles in 
Table 1b.  The stated uncertainty values for this unit are derived from a statistical analysis of the entire lot of wafers 
produced at the 0.01 ohm•cm resistivity level.  A summary of these uncertainties is given in Table 2. 
 
Previous silicon resistivity SRMs have also been used 
current) instruments and/or with other material system s such as compound semiconductors.  This SRM has similar 
utility, but it must be emphasized that NIST has rigorously  investigated the DC four-point method on bulk silicon 
only.  This SRM cannot be used as a thickness reference standard. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of this SRM is deemed to be indefinite, provided the SRM is handled 
and stored in accordance with the “Care and Handling” and “Cautions to User” sections of this certificate.  However, 
the certification will be nullified if the SRM is damaged, cont aminated, or modified.  It is possible to take several 
thousand individual probe measurements before performan ce degradation occurs.  Any degradation due to probe 
damage is evidenced by a shift in measured resistivity and a significant increase in measurement standard deviation. 
 When such a change in measurement results occurs, which  cannot be traced to the electronics or to a deteriorated 
probe, the certification is invalidated and the SRM should no longer be used.

Certified Value Uncertainties:   The uncertainties for the certified values were calculated in accordance with the 
ISO and NIST Guides [3].  The sources of uncertainty ar e identified below, with a more detailed explanation given 
in reference 4.  It is assumed that rectangular distribu

square-root of the sum of the Type A and Type B vari ances.  The expanded uncertainty is obtained by multiplying 
this combined uncertainty by a coverage factor; following NI ST guidelines, a coverage factor of two is used, and the 
expanded uncertainty is written as a 2 σ value.   
 
The following components of uncertainty were determined
process precision (short term) was estimated from a pooling  of the wafer center measurement variances of all the 
wafers (approximately 100) in this batch with compar
experiments; 2) day to day and longer term process 
certification control experiment values and from check wafer data taken during the course of the certification;  3) the 
effect of using a single four-point probe, out of all possible probes, for certification was estimated from the control 
experiments which utilized multiple probes.  The combined  variance from the above sources applies both to sheet 
resistance and to resistivity values.  An additional term 
for the typical variation of thickness values for individual 
wafer units is included in the uncertainty for resistiv ity values, but not in that for sheet resistance.  ( NOTE:  the 
electrical measurement process precision contributes only one-s ixth as much to the uncertainty of the average (of 6 
measurements) as it does to the uncertainty of the individual measurements.)

Measurement Procedure:   Each unit was individually measured by using a single in-line probe with nominal 
tions of ASTM F84 [1] for bulk silicon.  The dual-
1.59 mm probe point separation and meeting the specifica
configuration method [2,5] of four-point probe measuremen ts was used, with configuration “A” being identical to 
that in ASTM F84.  Eighteen measurements were taken on  each unit:  six were taken at the wafer center, separated 
by rotations of approximately 30° (these are averaged and reported for the center as a single location); six were taken 
at sites separated by rotations of 60° around a circle of ra
circle of radius 10 mm (0.4 in), again with rotational se parations of 60°.  The measurements described by these two 
circles started on the positive X-axis (negative Y-axis is nor mal to the wafer flat) and proceeded counter clockwise.  
Due to the nature of resistivity variations in silicon, the va lues certified for these circles cannot be used to predict the 
resistivity in other regions of the wafer. 
 
A DC current value was selected to give a measured specimen voltage between 9.95 mV and 10.05 mV in 
configuration “A” for the first measurement at the wafer center.  This current setting was maintained on the current 
supply for all subsequent measurements.  Values of current  at each of the measurement sites were determined to five 
or more digits using a standard resistor. 
 
Thickness uniformity for the region of the electrical measur ements was evaluated for each wafer by using the nine-
site plan of ASTM Method F84, with a radius of appr
pattern.  All points were required to have a thickness within 1 
acceptable for use as an SRM.  The average of all nine thickness measurements for this wafer is given in Table 3 and 
should be used to convert from sheet resistance to resistivity for each of the electrical measurement sites. 
 
Other possible sources of uncertainty were considered but  were estimated to be negligible based on experience.  
A detailed description of the certification procedure, meas
urement process control, and uncertainty analysis is 
contained in reference 4.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE  
 
Notes on SRM Use:   A four-point probe with spacing equal to or  greater than twice the wafer thickness effectively 
averages sheet resistance from front to back surfaces of a  wafer.  For this reason, either surface of the SRM wafer 
may be measured by the user’s four-point probe with negligible expected differences in the values measured. 
 
When the user needs to convert sheet resistance values
recommends using the thickness value given on this Certificat e to obtain best agreement with the certified resistivity 
value.  Due to the lapped surface texture of this wafer, independent thickness measurements by the user are likely to 
result in a slightly different value from that reported here, pa rticularly if a different type of thickness gauge is used.  
This would result in a degraded transfer of resistivity  scale using this SRM although it would have no bearing on the 
transfer of the sheet resistance value.   Due to its lapped surface texture,  this wafer cannot be used as a reference 
material for wafer thickness. 
 
Care and Handling:   The lapped surfaces of this SRM give it 
as the use of gloves, finger cots, vacuum paddles, or 
stability.  Nevertheless, reasonable care in handling, such 
ss.  Storage in any reasonable, noncorrosive, nontoxic 
tweezers should be exercised to maintain wafer cleanline
environment, in conjunction with the packaging provided,
 should prove adequate for maintaining stability of the 
SRM.  Cleaning with the proper surfactant or with isopr opyl alcohol, together with thorough rinsing in deionized 
water and thorough drying, has been found acceptable for re moving most surface stains.  The use of hydrofluoric 
acid or of elevated temperature treatments is discouraged.  The SRM should not be  stored or measured in an ambient 
relative humidity above 50 %. 
 
Cautions to User:   NIST strongly recommends that this SRM not be  used alone for calibration, or for testing the 
linearity or other performance characteristic of sheet resist ance/resistivity measuring equipment.  For any of these 
applications, use one or more of the other SRM wafers

wafers with repeated probing.  
 
sistance measurement instruments or for evaluating the 
This SRM may not be appropriate for calibrating sheet re
sheet resistance/resistivity of materials other than silicon due  to differences of material and instrument parameters 
relative to single crystal silicon wafers and to DC conduc
tion measurements.  Among the material parameters are 
conduction and carrier scattering mechanisms, grain boundary effects on conduction, and the relative importance of 
sample surface vs. bulk in responding to the measurement s timulus.  Instrument parameters include electromagnetic 
frequency of the measurement stimulus, the associated sk in depth in the materials being measured, and sampling 
volume of the instrumentation in relation to material grain  size.  Parties interested in extending the calibration use of 
these SRMs are advised to contact Dr. James R. Ehrste
(301) 975-2060 or SiliconRes@nist.gov. 
 
Silicon has a noticeable temperature dependence for resistivity .  Accurate values of the temperature coefficient of 
silicon resistivity are available for the range 18 °C to 28 °C  [1].  If the user makes measurements at a temperature 
other than 23 °C, the resulting resistivity and sheet resistan ce values must be corrected to 23 °C for best agreement 
with the certified values.  Corrections for measurements  made outside of the 18 °C to 28 °C range may suffer from 
reduced accuracy. 
 
The localized variations in resistivity typically found in silicon wafers such as those of this SRM may limit the user’s 
ability to obtain exactly the certified values if instrumentation is employed having a sampling volume different from 
that of a 1.59 mm four-point probe.  However, it is likely 
that imprecision of the user’s instrumentation will be a 
more important limitation to transfer of the certified value than will differences in sampling volume.

Stability Tests:   Silicon wafers from all previous resistivity SR Ms have been monitored by NIST for as long as 
15 years with no cumulative drift of the measured resistivity  values.  While there were some measurement values in 
that monitoring sequence that were outside the confidence  limits determined from the certification uncertainty, those 
outlier values are believed to have been due to long-term  measurement environment variability as well as to the use 
of single-configuration probe measurements which are more  sensitive to changes of probes or to probe tip condition 
than are the dual-configuration measurements used for current SRM certification. 
 
Tests of the stability of silicon resistivity reference materials with repeated probing have shown that it is possible to 
make several thousand probe measurements without significan t change of value, even when the probing is confined 
to a very localized area.   However, the use of excessively sharp or  damaged probes, or of unconditioned new 
probes, may accelerate the   accumulation of crystalline damage  that leads to a shift in resistivity values or 
degraded measurement repeatability.  This is particularly tr ue for float zone or NTD silicon, both of which have low 
oxygen content and are more susceptible to crystalline damage from mechanical contact.  
 
Multilaboratory Measurement Reproducibility:  
ence intervals that might be expected when using this 
resistivity measurements are useful for guidance on confid
SRM to transfer resistivity scale values between NIST a
nd the user’s laboratory. While there have not been any 
reported multilaboratory tests using the dual-configuration  method of measurement, a number of tests have been 
conducted by ASTM using the single-configuration 
multilaboratory precision of just under 0.7 % for wafers with resistivities up to 120 ohm cm, and just under 1.7 % for 
wafers between 120 ohm•cm and 500 ohm•cm.  These values lead to 99 % confidence intervals of  ±  2 % for wafers 
up to 120 ohm •cm and  ± 5 % for wafers between 120 ohm •cm and 500 ohm •cm [1].  Because of the relatively 
hose ASTM multilaboratory tests, the resulting confidence 
nonuniform, small (5 cm) diameter wafers used for t
 to what could be expected on wafers with improved 
intervals are believed to be quite conservative compared
uniformity such as those from this SRM series, particular ly if the dual-configuration four-point probe methodology 
were employed by all laboratories.
