Standard Reference Material 3287 
 
Blueberry (Fruit) 

 
This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  use  in  validating  analytical  methods  for  the 
determination of organic acids, anthocyanidins, and nutrients in blueberries and similar materials.  This SRM can also 
be used for quality assurance when assigning values to in-house control materials.  A unit of SRM 3287 consists of 
five packets, each containing approximately 5 g of freeze-dried, powdered fruit. 
 
The  development  of  SRM 3287  was  a  collaboration  between  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and 
Technology (NIST) and the National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements (NIH-ODS). 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values:  Certified mass fraction values for quinic acid, free water-soluble vitamins, and 
elements in SRM 3287, reported on a dry-mass basis, are provided in Tables 1 through 3.  A NIST certified value is 
a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias have 
been taken into account [1].  Analyses for value assignment were performed by NIST and collaborating laboratories.  
Certified values were calculated as the mean of the mean values from NIST methods and the median of the mean 
values of results provided by collaborating laboratories, where appropriate.  The associated uncertainties are expressed 
at an approximately 95 % level of confidence [2–4]. 
 
Reference  Mass  Fraction  Values:    Reference  mass  fraction  values  for  anthocyanidins,  additional  organic  acids, 
anions, proximates, amino acids, and additional nutrients are provided in Tables 4 through 7.  A NIST reference value 
is a noncertified value that is the best estimate of the true value based on available data; however, the value does not 
meet  the  NIST  criteria  for  certification [1]  and  is  provided  with  an  associated  uncertainty  that  may  reflect  only 
measurement reproducibility, may not include all sources of uncertainty, or may reflect a lack of sufficient statistical 
agreement among multiple analytical methods.  The reference mass fraction values were derived from results reported 
by NIST and/or collaborating laboratories. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 3287 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until 01 December 2027, provided the SRM is stored in accordance with instructions given in this certificate (see 
“Instructions for Storage and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, or otherwise 
modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Overall direction and coordination of the technical measurements leading to the original certification of this SRM 
were performed by L.C. Sander, K.E. Sharpless, and S.A. Wise of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division and S. Ehling 
of the Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA, Washington, DC).  Revision of this certificate was coordinated by 
C.A. Rimmer and L.J. Wood of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division.

NOTICE AND WARNINGS TO USERS 
 
SRM 3287 IS INTENDED FOR RESEARCH USE; NOT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE AND USE 
 
Storage:  The SRM should be stored at controlled room temperature (20 °C to 25 °C), in unopened packets, until 
required for use.  For elemental analyses, the packet can be opened and resealed; test portions can be removed and 
analyzed until the material reaches its expiration date.  For other analyses, the packet can be opened and resealed; test 
portions can be removed and analyzed for two weeks after the packet was first opened. 
 
Use:  Prior to use, the contents of the packet should be mixed thoroughly.  Allow the contents to settle for one minute 
prior to opening to minimize the loss of fine particles.  Homogeneity of the material has not been evaluated for sample 
sizes smaller than those used by NIST methods described below.  Therefore, the certified and reference values may 
not be valid for test portions smaller than those described in the sections below:  0.1 g for organic acid analysis, 0.5 g 
for elemental analysis, 2.5 g for vitamin analysis, 1.0 g for anthocyanidin analysis.  Results obtained should include 
their  own  estimates  of  uncertainty  and  can  be  compared  to  the  certified  and  reference  values  using  procedures 
described in reference 5.  The moisture conversion factor below can be used for the sample(s) when using an unopened 
packet for the first time.  If using a previously opened and resealed packet, sample(s) need to be dried using one of 
the recommended techniques (see “Determination of Moisture”).  The moisture content should be determined on a 
separate sample from that used for analysis, and the analytical result corrected to a dry-mass basis for comparison 
with values in this certificate. 
 
Determination of Moisture:  Moisture content of SRM 3287 was determined at NIST by (1) freeze-drying to constant 
mass over 7 d; (2) drying over magnesium perchlorate in a desiccator at room temperature for 28 d; and (3) drying for 
1 h in a forced-air oven at 80 °C.  Unweighted results obtained using all three techniques were averaged to determine 
a conversion factor of (0.9859 ± 0.0065) gram dry mass per gram as-received mass, which was used to convert data 
from an as-received to a dry-mass basis; the uncertainty shown on this value is an expanded uncertainty.  A relative 
uncertainty component for the conversion factor (0.32 %) obtained from the moisture measurements is incorporated 
in  the  uncertainties  of  the  certified  and  reference  values,  reported  on  a  dry-mass  basis,  that  are  provided  in  this 
certificate. 
 
SOURCE, PREPARATION, AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Source and Preparation:  The material for production of SRM 3287 was a combination (approximately 50/50) of 
the  U.S.  Highbush  Blueberry 
Tifblue  and  Rubel (highbush  and 

rabbiteye  varieties)  acquired 

from 

                                                           
 

(1) Certain commercial equipment, instruments or materials are identified in this certificate to adequately specify the experimental 
procedure.    Such  identification  does  not  imply  recommendation  or  endorsement  by  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and 
Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the purpose.

Council (Folsom, CA), which provided freeze-dried powdered blueberries (40 mesh) in nitrogen-flushed cans.  The 
material  was  shipped  to  High-Purity  Standards (Charleston, SC), where it  was  blended,  aliquoted,  and  heat-sealed 
inside nitrogen-flushed 4 mil polyethylene bags, which were then sealed inside nitrogen-flushed aluminized plastic 
bags along with two packets of silica gel each.  Following packaging, SRM 3287 was irradiated (Neutron Products, 
Inc., Dickerson, MD) to an absorbed dose of 7.2 kGy to 8.4 kGy. 
 
acids 
Analytical Approach for Determination of Organic Acids:  Value assignment of the mass fractions of organic acids 
in SRM 3287 was based on the combination of measurements from two different methods:  isotope dilution liquid 
chromatography  with  mass  spectrometric  detection (ID-LC-MS)  and  ion  chromatography  with  conductivity 
detection (IC-CD). 
 
NIST Analysis for Organic Acids Using ID-LC-MS:  Mass fractions of organic acids were determined by ID-LC-MS 
from duplicate, nominal 0.1 g test portions taken from each of six packets of SRM 3287.  Organic acids were extracted 
into water and the solutions from four successive extractions were combined.  For analysis by ID-LC-MS, an organic 
acid column was held at 40 °C and an aqueous mobile phase containing 0.5 % (volume fraction) formic acid was used 
under isocratic conditions at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min.  The mass spectrometer was operated in negative ion mode, 
with  electrospray  ionization.    Each  organic  acid  was  matched  with  a  13C-  or  2H-labeled  internal  standard,  and 
quantitation was based on response factors calculated from the relative peak areas and concentrations.  Calibrants 
were prepared gravimetrically, at levels intended to approximate the levels of the organic acids in the SRM following 
extraction.  The purity of the neat organic acid calibrant materials was determined as an average of the manufacturer 
data  and  NIST  data,  including  LC-absorbance  at  210 nm,  LC  with  evaporative  light  scattering  detection (ELSD), 
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and Karl Fischer titration [6]. 
 
NIST Analysis for Organic Acids Using IC-CD:  Mass fractions of organic acids were determined by IC-CD from 
duplicate, nominal 0.1 g test portions taken from each of six packets of SRM 3287.  Organic acids were extracted into 
water  and  the  solutions  from  four  successive  extractions  were  combined.    A  hydroxide-selective  anion  exchange 
column was held at 30 °C and a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min was used for the separation.  Ultrapure water was used for 
generation  of  a  hydroxide  gradient,  and  a  current  of  186 mA  was  applied  for  suppression  of  the  background 
conductivity from the hydroxide mobile phase.  Quantitation was based on relative peak areas with trifluoroacetic 
acid (TFA) as an internal standard.  Calibrants were prepared gravimetrically, at levels intended to approximate the 
levels of the organic acids in the SRM following extraction.  The purity of the neat organic acid calibrant materials 
was  determined  as  an  average  of  the  manufacturer  data  and  NIST  data,  including  LC-absorbance  at  210 nm, 
LC-ELSD, DSC, and Karl Fischer titration [6]. 
 
Analytical Approach for Determination of Free Water-Soluble Vitamins:  Value assignment of the mass fractions 
of free water-soluble vitamins in SRM 3287 was based on the combination of results from NIST with confirmation 
from data provided by one collaborating laboratory.  NIST provided measurements by using ID-LC-MS.  Duplicate, 
nominal  2.5 g aliquots were  taken from  each of six  packets  for  analysis.   Vitamins  were  extracted  into water  that 
contained  acetic  acid,  and  the  solutions  from  four  such  successive  extractions  were  combined.    For  analysis  by 
ID-LC-MS,  a  C18 column  with  a  gradient  consisting  of  a  mobile  phase  of  methanol  and  20 mmol/L  ammonium 
formate in water was used with a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min.  The mass spectrometer was operated in the positive ion 
mode with electrospray ionization.  Each vitamin was matched with a 13C-, 15N-, or 2H-labeled internal standard, and 
quantitation was based on response factors calculated from the relative peak areas and concentrations.  Calibrants 
were prepared  gravimetrically,  at  levels  intended  to  approximate  the  levels  of  the  vitamins  in  the  SRM  following 
extraction.  The purity of calibrant materials was determined at NIST using LC-absorbance and DSC. 
 
Analytical  Approach  for  Determination  of  Elements:    Value  assignment  of  the  mass  fractions  of  elements  in 
SRM 3287 was based on the combination of results from NIST and collaborating laboratories, where available [7].  
NIST  provided  measurements  by  using  inductively  coupled  plasma  optical  emission  spectrometry (ICP-OES).  
Duplicate, nominal 0.5 g test portions from each of six packets of SRM 3287 were analyzed for calcium, copper, iron, 
magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, and zinc.  Test portions were digested in sealed vessels with 
a HNO3/HF mixture using a microwave digestion system.  Quantitation was based on the method of standard additions 
using calibration solutions prepared from the SRM 3100 series of single-element standard solutions. 
 
Analytical  Approach  for  Determination  of  Anthocyanidins:    Value  assignment  of  the  mass  fractions  of 
ctions  of
anthocyanidins in SRM 3287 was based on measurements at NIST using LC-absorbance.  Mass fractions of cyanidin, 
delphinidin, malvidin, peonidin, and petunidin were measured by LC-absorbance using duplicate, nominal 1.0 g test 
portions from each of six packets of SRM 3287.  Anthocyanidins were isolated from SRM 3287 and hydrolyzed by 
using a 24-h Soxhlet extraction into 225 mL of 6 % (volume fraction) hydrochloric acid in methanol.  Pelargonidin 
chloride was used as an internal standard.  Following extraction, 50 mL of the extract was reduced to approximately 
10 mL and analyzed by LC-absorbance using a C18 column and detection at 520 nm.  Gradient elution was used with 
a 25 mmol/L potassium phosphate/methanol mobile phase and a flow rate of 1 mL/min.  Calibrants were prepared

gravimetrically at levels intended to approximate the levels of the anthocyanidins in the SRM following extraction.  
The purity of the neat calibrant materials was determined at NIST using LC-absorbance at 520 nm. 
 
Collaborating Laboratories’ Analyses:  The GMA FIACC laboratories were asked to use their usual methods to 
make  single  measurements  on  test  portions  taken  from  each  of  two  packets  of  SRM 3287  for  measurements  of 
nutrients.    Because  of  the  variability  among  data  provided  by  laboratories  participating  in  an  interlaboratory 
comparison  exercise,  the  median  of  the  means  is  used.    The  median  of  the  collaborating  laboratories’  means  was 
combined with NIST data for calculation of certified values of elements.  Collaborating laboratories’ data alone were 
used to assign reference values for proximates, sugars, and amino acids. 
 
Homogeneity  Assessment:    The  homogeneity  of  anthocyanidins,  organic  acids,  free  water-soluble  vitamins,  and 
element  mass  fractions  was  assessed  at  NIST  using  the  methods  and  test  portion  sizes  described  above.    The 
uncertainties  for  delphinidin,  malvidin,  petunidin,  and  peonidin  incoporate  an  uncertainty  component  for  possible 
inhomogeniety  based  on  standard  deviation  for  the  test  portion  size  analyzed  (see  “Source,  Preparation,  and 
Analysis”).    Homogeneity  of  constituents  measured  solely  by  collaborating  laboratories  (e.g.,  proximates,  amino 
acids) was not assessed, although the data were treated as though these analytes were homogeneously distributed. 
 
Value Assignment:  For calculation of assigned values for analytes that were measured only by NIST, the mean of 
the mean values from NIST results were used.  The collaborating laboratories reported the individual results for each 
of their analyses for a given analyte.  The mean of each laboratory’s results was then determined.  For calculation of 
assigned values for analytes that were measured only by the GMA FIACC laboratories, the median of the laboratory 
means was used.  For analytes that were also measured by NIST, the mean of the individual sets of NIST data were 
averaged with the median of the individual GMA FIACC laboratory means.  In some cases, the calculation of assigned 
values is the mean of the means of NIST results with confirmation provided by collaborating laboratories. 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Value for Quinic Acid:  The certified mass fraction value, reported on a dry-mass basis, is 
the combined mean from the means of NIST ID-LC-MS data and the mean of NIST IC-CD data.  Values are expressed 
as x ± U95%(x), where x is the certified value and U95%(x) is the expanded uncertainty of the certified value.  The true 
value  of  the  analyte  is  believed  to  lie  within  the  interval  x ± U95%(x)  with  95 %  confidence.    To  propagate  this 
uncertainty, treat the certified value as a normally distributed random variable with mean x and standard deviation 
U95%(x)/2 [2–4].  The measurand is the total mass fraction of quinic acid in blueberry (fruit) as listed in Table 1 on a 
dry-mass basis.  Metrological traceability is to the measurement unit as realized through the purity determined for the 
primary chemical standards employed in the NIST methods.

Reference Mass Fraction Values for Anthocyanidins:  Each reference mass fraction value is the mean result of 
NIST analyses using LC-absorbance.  Values are expressed as x ± U95%(x), where x is the estimated value and U95%(x) 
is the expanded uncertainty of the value.  The method-specific value of the analyte is believed to lie within the interval 
x ± U95%(x) with about a 95 % confidence [2–4].  The measurand is the mass fraction for each anthocyanidin listed in 
Table 7, on a dry-mass basis, as determined by the method indicated.  Metrological traceability is to mass fraction 
(expressed as milligrams per kilogram) as realized by the methods used.
