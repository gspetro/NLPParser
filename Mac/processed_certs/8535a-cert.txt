Reference  Values  for  the  Relative  Difference  in  Isotope-Number  Ratios:    The  differences  in  measured 
isotope-number  ratios  of  stable  hydrogen  isotopes [N(2H)/N(1H)]  and  stable  oxygen  isotopes [N(18O)/N(16O)]  are 
reported  as  δ2H  and  δ18O  values,  respectively.    The  relative  difference  in  isotope-number  ratios  for  hydrogen  and 
oxygen are defined as:  

hydrogen 

δ2H = ([N (2H)sample /N (1H) sample] – [N (2H) VSMOW-SLAP /N (1H)VSMOW-SLAP]) / [N (2H)VSMOW-SLAP /N (2H)VSMOW-SLAP] 

δ18O = ([N (18O)sample /N (16O)sample] – [N (18O)VSMOW-SLAP /N (16O)VSMOW-SLAP]) / [N (18O)VSMOW-SLAP /N (16O)VSMOW-SLAP
] 

VSMOW-SLAP refers to the Vienna SMOW-SLAP δ-scales, which are defined by assigning δ2H and δ18O values of 
0 ‰  to  VSMOW2 (RM 8535a)  and  values  of  –427.5 ‰ (δ2H)  and  –55.50 ‰ (δ18O)  to  measurements  of 
SLAP2 (RM 8537a)  for  the  purpose  of  normalizing  stable  hydrogen  and  oxygen  isotope  measurements  (see 
“Normalization”) [2-4]. 
 
Expiration  of  Value  Assignment:    RM 8535a  is  valid,  within  the  measurement  uncertainty  specified,  until 
ition 
31 December 2020, provided the RM is handled in accordance with instructions given in this Report of Investigation 
ged, 
(see  “Instructions  for  Handling,  Storage,  and  Use”).    The  reference  values  are  nullified  if  the  RM  is  damaged, 
contaminated, or otherwise modified.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
Intended Use:  The international measurement standard VSMOW2 is a calibration reference material that, when used 
together with SLAP2 (RM 8537a), provides water standards with reference values of their relative difference in 2H/1H 
and  18O/16O  isotope-number  ratios  that  define  the  VSMOW–SLAP δ-scales.    A  third  reference  material,  GISP 
(Greenland Ice Sheet Precipitation, RM 8536), is also available to check the calibration of internal laboratory standards 
when  using  VSMOW2  and  SLAP2.    These  three  materials  are  available  from  the  International  Atomic  Energy 
Agency (IAEA,  Vienna,  Austria)  and  from  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology (NIST, 
Gaithersburg, MD).  
 
international 
Distribution:    The  distribution  of  RM 8535a (VSMOW2)  is  limited  to  one  unit  per  year.    As  an  international 
measurement standard, this RM, together with SLAP2 (RM 8537a), is intended to calibrate working standards and 
allow investigators to produce δ2H and δ18O data that are comparable worldwide [5,6] on the VSMOW–SLAP scale.  
Users are strongly advised to prepare their own standards for daily use and calibrate those standards against these 
international reference materials. 
 
Storage and Stability:  The original unopened ampoules of RM 8535a should be stored at ambient temperature in 
due  to  the  strong  possibility 
the dark.  The unused fractions of this RM should be discarded immediately after opening due to the strong possibility 
be  used 
of evaporative losses causing significant isotope fractionation.  Furthermore, aliquots of this RM should not be used 
for repeated calibrations by repeated stable isotope measurements using water/CO2 equilibration devices over multiple 
days due to isotopic exchange  with the applied gas and resulting  shift of the isotopic composition of the  material 
during the preparation process.  The reference values in this Report of Investigation apply only to freshly opened 
ampoules. 
 
Absolute  Isotope-Number  Ratios  in  VSMOW2:    No  absolute  isotope-number  ratios  have  been  determined  for 
VSMOW2.  As the isotopic composition of this material is very close to that of VSMOW (RM 8535), the published 
absolute  isotope-number  ratios  of  RM 8535  provide  a  good  estimate  of  the  absolute  isotope-number  ratios  in 
VSMOW2 [7-11].  These values are listed in Table 2 of the Reports of Investigation for Reference Materials 8535, 
8536, and 8537 [12].  The isotopic values are the same as those recommended by the Bureau International de Poids et 
Mesures (BIPM) for isotopic corrections to the definition of the kelvin temperature scale in 2005 [13]. 
 
Information Values:  The δ17O value of VSMOW is zero by consensus, just as its δ18O value is zero by consensus.  
The  δ17O  value  of  VSMOW2  was  measured  and  compared  with  that  of  VSMOW [14]  and  is  identical  within  an 
uncertainty of about ± 0.03 ‰.  Additional  measurements  were conducted by Y. Lin at the University of Chicago 
(Chicago, Illinois, USA) in 2007 comparing VSMOW2 and SLAP2 with VSMOW and SLAP, respectively.  These 
measurements confirmed their equivalence within an uncertainty of about ± 0.05 ‰ for both cases [15]. 
 
The  tritium  activity  concentration  of  VSMOW2,  determined  at  the  IAEA  by  direct  gas  counting,  was 
3.5 TU ± 1.0 TU (tritium  unit)  on  06 July 2007.    The  reported  uncertainty  is  one  standard  deviation.    Information 
values cannot be used to establish metrological traceability. 
 
Sample Preparation:  The decision to produce a new international  measurement  standard, VSMOW2, to replace 
VSMOW came from a recommendation of a Consultants Group Meeting convened by the IAEA in December, 1996.  
VSMOW2 was prepared at the IAEA Isotope Hydrology Laboratory in 1999 from three fresh water samples: one from 
Lake Bracciano located near Rome, Italy (R. Gonfianini, G.-M. Zuppi), another from Lake Galilee, Israel (E. Adar), 
and a third from a well located near Cairo, Egypt (F. Hussein).  These raw water samples were selected because they 
were close to the isotopic composition of VSMOW and could be mixed in appropriate proportions to give an isotopic 
composition nearly identical to the original VSMOW.  The δ2H of one of these raw materials had to be adjusted by 
about 6 ‰ to allow the production of about 300 liters of VSMOW2.  This adjustment was performed via a modified 
platinum  catalytic  exchange  reaction  using  the  diffusive  exchange  of  hydrogen  gas  between  membrane-separated 
compartments containing the raw water and deuterated water.  This approach avoided changing the δ17O and δ18O 
values of the raw material.  The final mixing was performed after measuring the isotopic composition of the raw water 
in  five  selected  laboratories:    IAEA  Isotope  Hydrology  Laboratory,  Vienna, Austria  (M. Gröning);  USGS  Reston 
Stable 
Isotope  Research, 
Groningen, Netherlands (H.A.J. Meijer); GFZ Isotope Hydrology  Laboratory, Neuherberg, Germany (W. Stichler); 
and University of East Anglia Isotope Hydrology Laboratory, U.K. (P. Dennis).  Altogether, 300 liters of VSMOW2 
were prepared by gravimetrically mixing the three water samples in a specially constructed storage container.  Initially 
5000 glass ampoules were filled with 20 mL of VSMOW2 each.  The remaining portion of about 200 liters remains 
in the original container for ampouling when needed. 
 
Homogeneity:    A  random  selection  of  27 ampoules  was  taken  from  the  first  production  run  of  5000 ampoules  to 
assess  the  homogeneity  of  the  mixed  waters  and  any  effects  resulting  from  the  filling  procedure.    Multiple

over 
measurements were taken of each ampoule over one to two days, and the resultant data were used to evaluate the 
tween  the  average  of  all  the 
analytical reproducibility. The differences between the average of all the data and the individual ampoule means were 
were
used to estimate the degree of homogeneity within the sampled population.  The between-ampoule variability was 
also calculated by single-factor ANOVA analysis [16,17].  The homogeneity uncertainty contribution of the mixed 
waters to the total uncertainty of measurements between ampoules was found to be negligible, less than 0.004 ‰ for 
δ18O and less than 0.07 ‰ for δ2H.  The largest uncertainty component in the uncertainty budget was a consequence 
of the limited number of measurements that could be made on water from any one ampoule. 
 
Characterization  and  Value  Assignment:    The  δ2H  and  δ18O  reference  values  for  VSMOW2  came  from  a 
characterization study directly comparing VSMOW2 and VSMOW, thereby minimizing the resulting uncertainty of 
the value assignment processes.  The characterization was carried out by three isotope hydrology laboratories:  the 
USGS laboratory in Reston, Virginia, USA, the Center for Isotope Research, University of Groningen, Netherlands, 
and  the  IAEA  Isotope  Hydrology  Laboratory,  Vienna,  Austria.    For  both  δ2H  and  δ18O,  the  mean  value  and  the 
combined  standard  uncertainty  are  the  result  of  combining  all  measurements  from  the  three  laboratories.    The 
combined standard uncertainties include contributions from the upper limits for the inhomogeneity between bottled 
glass ampoules and the residual biases of the mean values.  The results of this study suggest that the δ18O value and 
the  δ2H  value  of  VSMOW2  are  identical  to  those  in  VSMOW,  within  measurement  uncertainty.    The  combined 
standard uncertainty associated with the δ2H and δ18O reference values of VSMOW2, as provided in Table 1, should 
be included in any uncertainty analysis of measurement results when VSMOW2 is used as a calibrator.  Note that the 
δ-values of the predecessor material, VSMOW, had no associated uncertainty as those  values  were defined as the 
zeros of the respective δ-scales. 
 
Normalization:    The  δ-values  for  hydrogen  and  oxygen,  when  measured  in  samples,  are  presented  as  parts  per 
thousand  differences (per  mill; ‰)  from  the  VSMOW  δ-value  normalized  with  the  defined  SLAP  δ-value.    The 
adoption of VSMOW as the zero point of the δ-scale and of a fixed SLAP δ-value by convention corresponds to the 
normalization  of  δ-values  on  the  VSMOW-SLAP  scale [2].    A  general  formula  for  normalizing  hydrogen  isotope 
measurement results using two laboratory standards LS1 (VSMOW2) and LS2 (SLAP2) can be expressed as:

where   WS denotes measurements made versus a transfer gas (working standard),

cal denotes calibrated measurements made versus the VSMOW–SLAP scale, and  
δ2H  LS1,cal  and  δ2HLS2,cal  are  the  conventionally  fixed  δ2H  values  for  VSMOW2  and  SLAP2  or  those  of 
calibrated laboratory working standards. 

 
Similar formulae are used for δ18O. 
 
The  δ-definition  of  Eq. (1)  is  identical  to  the  one  in  conventional  use [9]  if  and  only  if  f = 1,  that  is  if  no  scale 
compression occurs and the δ-values measured on a given instrument correspond exactly to the recommended values 
for δVSMOW2 and δSLAP2. 
 
Please note that the reporting scales for δ2H and δ18O are still denoted and referred to as the VSMOW-SLAP scales in 
spite of the exhaustion of the original supply of VSMOW and SLAP [18].  Therefore in Eq. 1 and Eq. 2, the measured 
values for the new international measurement standards VSMOW2 and SLAP2 are entered for LS1 and LS2.  The 
data  are  then  normalized  to  the  VSMOW-SLAP  scale  using  VSMOW2  and  SLAP2.    Of  course,  the  standard 
uncertainties of VSMOW2 and SLAP2 isotopic values have to be included in any uncertainty budget. 
 
Reporting  of  Stable  Isotope  δ-Values:    The  following  recommendations  are  provided  for  reporting  the  relative 
difference of hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope-number ratios using the δ-notation modified from Coplen [19], it is
