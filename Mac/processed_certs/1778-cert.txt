Certificate of Analysis 
Standard Reference Material 1778 

 

 
Naval Brass WK3 
(In Cooperation with the Institute of Non-Ferrous Metals, Gliwice, Poland) 
 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is in the form  of a disk approximately 39.5 mm in diameter and 20 mm thick 
intended primarily for use in optical emission and X-ray fluorescence spectrometric methods of analysis.  This material is 
one in a series of five monolithic naval brasses prepared to cover a range of compositions for particular elements of interest. 
 The other naval brasses in this WK series are SRMs 1776, 1777, 1779, and 1780. 
 
These SRMs were produced as part of a joint project between the NIST SRM Program and the Institute of Non-Ferrous 
Metals (IMN) in Gliwice, Poland under the sponsorship of the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Joint Fund.  Actual preparation of 
these materials was performed at the IMN using specialized production facilities.  The melting and casting technology used 
for the preparation of these materials was provided by M. Lachowski of the IMN [1]. 
 
The certified values for ten elements are listed in Table 1.  The analytical methods used for the characterization of this SRM 
are given in Table 2.  All values are reported as mass fractions [2].

Certified Values and Uncertainties:   The certified values are the means of the results from one or more analytical 
methods.  The uncertainty listed for each certified value is expressed as the “combined uncertainty” calculated according   
to the ISO Guide [3].  Each value listed is the 95 % confidence limit of the “true value”, and is intended to represent the 
combined effect of uncertainty components associated with various analytical factors such as method imprecision, possible 
systematic errors among methods, and material variability.  

Expiration of Certification:  The certification of this SRM is valid, within the measurement uncertainties specified, until 
31 December 2004.  Even though this material will likely remain stable for many years, the period of NIST certification 
has been abbreviated because the criteria used in the orig
requirements [4].  This certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, or otherwise modified.

The overall coordination of technical measurement and interlaboratory analyses were provided by W. Stankiewicz of the 
IMN and W.P. Reed of the NIST Office of Measurement Services. 
 
Homogeneity testing was performed by E. Műller and S. Witkowska of the IMN, Gliwice, Poland and by P.A. Pella and 
M.L. Salit of the NIST Analytical Chemistry Division. 
 
Statistical analysis was provided by L.M. Gill and L. Alvarez-Rojas of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division. 
 
The technical and support aspects involved in the preparation, certification, and issuance of this SRM were coordinated 
through the NIST Standard Reference Materials Program by P.A. Lundberg.  Support aspects involved in the issuance of 
the revised certificate were coordinated through the NIST Standard Reference Materials Program by B.S. MacDonald of the 
NIST Measurement Services Division.   
 
Alloy Preparation:  Each brass alloy was sequentially cast as four billets of material.  Homogeneity testing was done prior 
to further processing.  The billets were then heated in a resistance furnace to approximately 800 °C, followed by an 
extrusion press to the final 39.5 mm diameter.  Homogeneity testing was done on each end of every rod and preliminary 
analysis was done by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry, optical emission spectrometry, and atomic absorption spectrometry. 
 The final samples were then cut from selected samples repr esenting the entire lot, milled into chips, and a composite 
produced.   The certification was done using samples of the composite.
