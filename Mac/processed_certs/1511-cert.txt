Certificate of Analysis 
Standard Reference Material® 1511 

 

Multi-Drugs of Abuse in Freeze-Dried Urine 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended primarily for verifying the accuracy of methods used for the 
determination of morphine, codeine, cocaine metabolite (benzoylecgonine), marijuana metabolite (THC-9-COOH), and 
phencyclidine in human urine.  SRM 1511 consists of three (3) bottles of freeze−dried urine with all of the analytes 
included in each bottle.  (See reconstitution procedure for reconstitution to 25 mL.)  There is no blank urine with this 
SRM. 
 
Certified Concentration:  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy 
and that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or accounted for by NIST [1].  The certified 
values and uncertainties for the analytes, as the free bases, are given below.

The certified concentrations apply only to urine reconstituted as specified under “Reconstitution Procedure” and are 
based upon the equally weighted results from two different analytical methods for each analyte.  For benzoylecgonine, 
morphine, codeine, and phencyclidine, gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and liquid chromatography 
mass spectrometry (LC/MS) data were used and the uncertainty is a 95 % confidence interval for the mean.  For the 
THC-9-COOH, the mean concentration was computed from GC/MS and gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry 
mass spectrometry (GC/MS/MS) measurements taken at NIST and the uncertainty is also a 95 % confidence interval for 
the  mean.    However,  this  confidence  interval  also  includes  variability  observed  between  NIST  and  five  military 
laboratories which had been used to demonstrate the suitability of the material.  It is assumed that systematic errors are 
very small compared to random errors.  The expanded uncertainties, U, equal k times the standard uncertainties (uc) with 
k = 2, and conform with ISO and NIST Guides [2]. 
  
(a) For phencyclidine, the original results were combined with new measurements using LC/MS to generate a prediction value of the 
  concentration from 2005 to 2010 with the expanded uncertainty U for the 95 % prediction interval. 
 
This material also contains amphetamine and methamphetamine, but these analytes were NOT certified as analytical 
results indicated probable degradation of these constituents with time.   
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of this SRM lot is valid until 01 January 2010, within the measurement 
uncertainties  specified,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  given  in  this 
certificate.  However, the certification is invalid if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, or modified. 
 
The overall direction and coordination of the technical measurements leading to the certification of this SRM were 
performed by M.J. Welch of the NIST Analytical Chemistry Division.

The analytical measurements for certification of this SRM were performed by R.G. Christensen, P. Ellerbe, C.S. Phinney, 
L.C. Sander, and S.S.−C. Tai of the NIST Analytical Chemistry Division.  Stability measurements were performed 
by S.S.-C. Tai. 
 
Statistical analysis was provided by K.J. Coakley and N.F. Zhang of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division. 
 
 
The support aspects involved in the issuance of this SRM were coordinated through the NIST Measurement Services 
Division. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 
 
Reconstitution Procedure:  In order for the certified concentration to be valid, the SRM must be reconstituted as 
follows:  twenty-five milliliters (25.0 mL) of organic-free water at room temperature must be added to each bottle.  The 
bottles  should  be  allowed  to  stand  at  room  temperature  with  occasional  swirling  for  30  min  to  ensure  complete 
dissolution.  Do not shake.  Vigorous shaking causes foaming, which may lead to inhomogeneous distribution of the 
analytes within the bottle.  After completion of the reconstitution procedure, samples should be extracted and processed 
within one h in order to achieve the certified concentration within the specified uncertainty range. 
 
Storage and Stability:  Prior to reconstitution, SRM 1511 should be stored in the dark at temperatures between −10 °C 
and 5 °C.  NIST will continue to monitor this SRM and purchasers will be notified if evidence indicates a change in the 
certified concentrations.  
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the  purchaser.  
Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
NOTICE AND WARNING TO USERS 
 
This material is for laboratory use only.  SRM 1511 may contain hazardous substances.  The reconstituted urine should 
be handled with precautions suitable for fresh urine samples. 
 
Source of the Material:  The material was prepared by Consolidated Technologies, Inc. (Austin, TX).1
 
Analytical Methods 
   
Method 1:  Certification of the concentrations of analytes in this material was based on two independent methods 
performed on separately prepared samples.  These methods have been described in more detail in references 3 through 9. 
For  all  of  the  analytes,  one  of  the  methods  used  for  certification  involved  gas  chromatography/mass  spectrometry 
(GC/MS).  Separate samples were prepared and separate analyses performed for each analyte except for morphine and 
codeine, which were prepared and analyzed together.  Samples were reconstituted as described in the “Reconstitution 
Procedure” section.  For the GC/MS analyses, the number of independently prepared sets and the number of samples per 
set for each analyte are as follows: morphine/codeine, 3 and 6; benzoylecgonine and phencyclidine, 3 and 5; and 
THC-9-COOH, 4 and 6.  From each vial, a single aliquot was taken, spiked with known amounts of the corresponding 
deuterated internal standards, and put through a solid-phase column.  The analytes were eluted following the column 
manufacturer's directions and the solvent evaporated.  For GC/MS measurements, the residue was dissolved in 
N,O−bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide to form the trimethylsilyl derivatives, except in the case of phencyclidine, which was 
dissolved in ethyl acetate and not derivatized.  The GC/MS measurements were performed using either a quadrupole 
mass spectrometer or an ion trap mass spectrometer operated in the electron ionization mode with a 30−meter nonpolar 
fused silica capillary column connected directly to the ion source.  The ions monitored for each analyte and its deuterated 
analog were as follows:  morphine, m/z 429 and 432; codeine, m/z 371 and 374; benzoylecgonine, m/z 240 and 243; 
THC-9-COOH, m/z 371 and 374; and phencyclidine, m/z 200 and 205, respectively.  Analyte concentrations were 
calculated by linear interpolation from calibration curves constructed independently for each analyte for each set of 
samples. 

                    
 

 

 1 Certain commercial equipment, instrumentation, or materials are identified in this certificate to specify adequately the 
experimental procedure.  Such identification does not imply recommendation or endorsement by the NIST, nor does it imply that the 
materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the purpose.

Method 2:  The second method for all of the analytes except THC-9-COOH involved liquid chromatography/mass 
spectrometry (LC/MS).  For each analyte, six vials were reconstituted as described in “Reconstitution Procedure” at one 
time and a single 10.0 mL aliquot from each vial was spiked with a known amount of the corresponding deuterated 
internal standard.  Each sample was put through a solid-phase column that was different than the one used for GC/MS 
analyses but similar in separation mechanism, following the manufacturer's directions.  The residue was reconstituted in 
water for the LC/MS analyses, except for phencyclidine, which was dissolved in the LC mobile phase (see below).  For 
the LC/MS measurements of morphine, codeine, and phencyclidine, a commercial monomeric C18 column was used with 
an isocratic mobile phase consisting of either 0.75 % glacial acetic acid and 0.1 M ammonium acetate in water:methanol 
(85:15) (morphine and codeine) or methanol:water (55:45) with 1 mM heptanesulfonic acid, 20 mM ammonium acetate, 
and 3.5 % glacial acetic acid (phencyclidine).  For the LC/MS measurements of benzoylecgonine, a custom column with 
a triethyl bonded phase and an isocratic mobile phase of water:methanol (70:30) with 2 % glacial acetic acid and 0.1 
M ammonium  acetate  were  used.    The  thermospray  interface  was  operated  with  the  discharge  and  electron 
ionization off and temperatures were set to conditions optimized for sensitivity and stability.  The ions monitored for 
each  analyte  and  its  deuterated  analog  were  as  follows:    morphine,  m/z  286  and  289;  codeine,  m/z  300  and  303; 
benzoylecgonine, m/z 290 and 293; and phencyclidine, m/z 244 and 249, respectively.  Analyte concentrations were 
calculated from comparison of measured ratios with response factors from standard mixtures. 
 
Method 2 for THC-9-COOH:  The second method for THC-9-COOH involved GC/MS/MS.  Four vials were prepared, 
spiked, and processed as was done for the GC/MS analyses, except that a different solid-phase extraction was used.  
Measurements were performed on an ion trap mass spectrometer with specially modified software to permit optimum 
excitation of parent ions.  Electron ionization was used to generate ions at m/z 371 and 374, which were subjected to 
resonance excitation, yielding daughter ions at m/z 305 and 308 for the analyte and its deuterated analog, respectively.  
Analyte concentrations were calculated by linear interpolation from calibration curves. 
 
The purity of the reference compounds used for calibration of all methods were assessed and appropriate corrections 
were made when calculating the certified values. 
 
Military Laboratory Round-Robin Study:  A group of military laboratories involved in urine drug testing were sent 
samples of the SRM for their evaluation.  Five laboratories returning results used GC/MS methods.  Their results (mean 
and one standard deviation) are summarized below.

These results were not used in calculating the certified values (except as noted above in the “Certified Concentration” 
section); they were used to demonstrate that this material was suitable for its intended purpose in field laboratories. 
 
Stability Testing:  Stability measurements were performed using LC/MS with electrospray ionization operated in the 
positive  ion  mode  for  morphine,  codeine,  benzoylecgonine,  and  phencyclidine  and  in  the  negative  mode  for 
THC−9−COOH.  Samples were reconstituted and prepared as described for LC/MS measurements.  Analytes were 
separated by LC on a C18 column (15 cm × 2.1 mm, 5 μm particle diameter).  A gradient mobile phase consisting of 
0.1 %  acetic  acid  in  water:methanol  was  used  for  the  positive  ion  measurements.  The  gradient  was  initially  set  at 
water:methanol (92:8) for 7.5 min, ramped to water:methanol (75:25) at 7.6 min, and held for 17.4 min.  The ions 
monitored are those described above for LC/MS measurements.  For THC−9−COOH, an isocratic mobile phase of 
50 mmol/L ammonium acetate in water:methanol (32:68) was used for separation and measurements were made using 
m/z 343 and 346 for the unlabeled and deuterated forms, respectively.
