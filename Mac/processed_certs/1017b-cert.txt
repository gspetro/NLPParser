Standard Reference Material 1017b 
 
Glass Beads - Particle Size Distribution 
(100 µm to 400 µm diameter range) 

 
tticle  size 
This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  use  in  evaluating  and  calibrating  particle  size 
measuring instruments covering the 100 μm to 400 μm range.  Typical use is in the evaluation of wire-cloth test sieves 
in the range of 106 μm (No. 140) through 355 μm (No. 45).  A unit of SRM 1017b consists of approximately 70 g of 
solid spherical soda-lime glass spheres contained in a glass bottle. 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values:  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its 
accuracy  in  that  all  known  or  suspected  sources  of  bias  have  been  investigated  or  taken  into  account [1].    The 
measurand  is  the  cumulative  mass  distribution  of  SRM 1017b,  determined  using  both  scanning  electron 
microscopy (SEM)  and  standard  sieving  procedures  on  stratified  and  randomly  selected  bottles  of  spheres.    The 
certified values are presented in Table 1, which are the average of results  from the SEM analyses of spheres  with 
diameters less than a given length [2].  Metrological traceability is to the SI derived unit for mass fraction (expressed 
as percent).  The uncertainty, computed according to the ISO/JCGM Guide [3], is an expanded uncertainty at the 95 % 
level of confidence which includes uncertainty due to measurement imprecision as well as material variability. 
 
Information Values:  Information values for nominal and effective sieve openings are provided in Table 2, which 
were used to determine the variability between bottles as well as for a comparison with the SEM results.  Figure 1 is 
a graphical comparison of the SEM and sieve results.  An information value is considered to be a value that will be of 
interest to the SRM user, but insufficient information is available to assess the uncertainty associated with the value 
or only a limited number of analyses were performed [1].  Information values cannot be used to establish metrological 
traceability. 
 
Expiration  of  Certification:    The  certification  of  SRM 1017b  is  valid  indefinitely,  within  the  measurement 
uncertainty  specified,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  given  in  this 
certificate  (see  “Instructions  for  Handling  and  Use”).    Periodic  recertification  of  this  SRM  is  not  required.    The 
certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, mass loss or material spillage that exceeds 2 % of the 
original mass, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical changes occur that affect the certification, NIST will notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet 
or register online) will facilitate notification.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING AND USE 
 
The entire bottle of spheres should be used in any application of this SRM.  If this is impractical, special care must be 
exercised when producing subsamples from the SRM unit.  The recommended procedure is to use a microriffler to 
divide the entire 70 g unit until an appropriate subsample size is obtained.  An appropriate subsample size should be 
validated by the user; fewer (larger) subsamples are generally preferred. 
 
PREPARATION, AND ANALYSIS 
 
Preparation:  The SEM values are based on the measurement of over 9 000 individual spheres from five bottles.  
Preparation of the SEM samples was designed to achieve a balanced sampling of the different size fractions and a 
balanced statistical measure of each size fraction.  This was achieved by the following steps:  five test bottles were 
sieved into seven size fractions and then riffle split with a spinning microriffler to obtain a sample amount that could 
be analyzed by SEM.  Electron  micrographs  were taken at seven different  magnifications to obtain both adequate 
counting statistics and diameter resolution for particles in each size range.  Images of the glass spheres were captured 
in a computer interfaced to the SEM.  Image analysis software was used for measurement of the sphere diameters.  
Magnification calibration of the measurement process was determined using SRM 484 Scanning Electron Microscope 
Magnification Standard (A Stage Micrometer Scale) and was checked with a stage micrometer slide calibrated at NIST 
with the NIST Line Scale Interferometer. 
 
Evaluation of the Effective Opening of Test Sieves with Calibrated Glass Spheres:  The allowed variation in sieve 
openings makes it difficult to compare size determinations made with different sets of sieves even though each set 
may comply with the applicable ASTM, ANSI, or ISO test standard.  The aperture size of a sieve can be determined 
as the average size of the openings in the sieve.  However, the purpose of a sieve is to measure the size of particles, 
and therefore, it is the effective opening that must be determined.  This effective opening is established by the size of 
the calibrated glass spheres that will just pass through the sieve.  This, in turn, permits the measurement of the particle 
size of an unknown material that will also just pass through the sieve. 
 
The openings of a sieve are not all the same size, and particles that are larger than the average opening can pass through 
the larger holes.  Thus, the effective opening is generally larger than the average opening.  In addition, the separation 
achieved by a sieve is not sharp.  A few particles capable of passing the sieve are always retained. The number of 
particles retained or passed depends on the manner and time of shaking and any measurement of the effective opening 
must take these variables into account.  To a large extent, the glass sphere method of calibration automatically includes 
these effects because the sieves are shaken in the same manner, when being calibrated, as when measuring an unknown 
material. 
 
The openings of sieves are essentially square and particles of irregular shape can pass through openings, even though 
one of the dimensions of the particle may be considerably larger than the size of the opening.  The average dimension 
of irregular particles that pass a sieve cannot be considered equal to the effective opening of the sieve as measured by 
the diameter of spheres that just pass. 
 
To evaluate the effective opening of standard 203 mm (8 in) or 305 mm (12 in) test sieves with this SRM, the entire 
bottle of spheres is poured onto the top sieve.  The sieves are then shaken in exactly the same manner as that to be 
followed in routine analysis.  (To prevent sieve blinding, the spheres should not be used with a single sieve.  A rough 
rule of thumb is to keep the loading below six layers of particles).  For use with 76 mm (3 in) test sieves, the mass of 
spheres must be reduced with a spinning riffler. 
 
After the shaking has been completed, the stack of sieves is disassembled, and the spheres are removed from each 
sieve and placed into a suitable weighing container.  To reduce loss of material during this step, the transfer should be 
done using a large funnel or over glazed paper to recover any spillage.  A soft brush is useful in removing the spheres 
from the sieve and funnel. 
 
Each of the sieve mass fractions is weighed to a precision of at least 0.01 g.  After weighing, all spheres are returned 
to the original bottle and kept for reuse.  The mass fraction retained on each sieve is used to calculate the ratio of the 
mass of spheres passing through a sieve to the total starting mass.  The effective size of the sieve opening is then 
determined by interpolation between the nearest bracketing values given in Table 1. 
 
Note:    The  above  calibration  procedure  is  for  use  in  comparison  of  sieve  results  and  as  a  method  to  periodically 
monitor for changes in sieves after service.  This procedure is not to be used as a certification for test sieves.

Information  Values:    The  values  in  Table 2  are  from  a  series  of  sieve  analyses  following  recommended  ASTM 
procedures [4].  A stacked set of seven sieves plus pan were used in a Ro-Tap®(1) sieving unit for a 15 min vibration 
time.  Ten bottles were sieved with an average material loss of 0.03 g from a 72 g bottle.  The effective diameters were 
obtained by comparing the mass fraction of glass spheres passing through a sieve, with the certified diameter for that 
mass fraction as listed in Table 1.  Each of the effective diameters is well within the permissible variation of average 
opening from the nominal sieve opening.  
 
The  mass  density  of  the  glass  is  2.47 g/cm3  as  determined  by  helium  gas  pycnometry  for  use  with  Stokes’  Law 
calculations.
