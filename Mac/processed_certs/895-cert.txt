National  Institute  of  Standards  &  Technology 
Certificate  of  Analysis 
Standard  Reference  Material  895 

(In  Cooperation  with  the  American  Society  for  Testing  and  Materials) 

This  Standard  Reference  Material  (SRM)  is  in  the  form  of  chips  sized  between  0.50  and  1.18  mm  sieve 
openings  (35  and  16  mesh).  It  is  intended  for  use  primarily  in  chemical  methods  of  analysis.  Similar  material 
for  use  in  spectrometric  methods  of  analysis  is  available  as  SRM  1297.

‘The  certified  value  listed  for  a  constituent  is  the  present  best  estimate  of  the  "true"  value  based  on  the  results 
of  the  cooperative  program  for  certification. 

’The  estimated  uncertainty  listed  for  a  constituent  is  based  on  judgment  and  represents  an  evaluation  of  the 
combined  effects  of  method  imprecision,  possible  systematic  errors  among  methods,  and  material  variability. 
No  attempt  was  made  to  derive  exact  statistical  measures  of  imprecision  because  several  methods  were  involved 
in  the  determination  of  most  constituents.

The  overall  coordination  of  the  technical  measurements  leading  to  certification  was  performed  under  the 
direction  of  J.I.  Shultz,  Research  Associate,  ASTM/NIST  Research  Associate  Program. 

The  technical  and  support  aspects  involved  in  the  preparation,  certification,  and  issuance  of  this  Standard 
Reference  Material  were  coordinated  through  the  Standard  Reference  Materials  Program  by  P.A.  Lundberg.
