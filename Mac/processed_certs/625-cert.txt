Certificate of Analysis 
 
Standard Reference Material 625  
 
Zinc-Base Die-Casting Alloy A 
(block form) 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended primarily for evaluating chemical and instrumental methods of 
analysis of zinc-base die-casting alloys.  SRM 625 is one of a series of reference materials (SRMs 625 through 630) 
for this purpose.  A unit of SRM 625 consists of a bar segment approximately 44 mm square and 19 mm thick.  The 
metallurgical condition is that resulting from a continuous chill casting process. 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values:  The measurand is the total elemental content for each constituent in SRM 625.  
The  certified  values  for  11 elements  are  listed  in  Table 1.    The  test  methods  used  for  certification  are  listed  in 
Table 2.  All values are reported as mass fractions [1] calculated as the unweighted mean of the mean values from 
the individual laboratories.  The uncertainty listed with each value is an expanded uncertainty (approximately 95 % 
confidence level [2]) the standard deviation of the mean of means and calculated in accordance with the method in 
the  ISO/JCGM  Guide [3].    A  NIST  certified  value  is  a  value  for  which  NIST  has  the  highest  confidence  in  its 
accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account.  A certified 
value  is  the  present  best  estimate  of  the  “true”  value  based  on  the  results  of  analyses  performed  at  NIST  and 
collaborating  laboratories.    Metrological  traceability  is  to  the  derived  SI  unit  for  mass  fraction  (expressed  as  a 
percent).

Expiration  of  Certification:    The  certification  of  SRM 625  is  valid  indefinitely,  within  the  measurement 
uncertainty  specified,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  given  in  this 
certificate  (see  “Instructions  for  Use”).    Periodic  recertification  of  this  SRM  is  not  required.    The  certification  is 
nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance  of  SRM  Certification:    NIST  will  monitor  this  SRM  over  the  period  of  its  certification.    If 
substantive technical changes occur that affect the certification, NIST will notify the purchaser.  Registration (see 
attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
he 
The  original  characterization  of  SRM 625  was  performed  in  1964.    Overall  direction  and  coordination  of  the 
technical measurements leading to certification of this SRM were performed by R.E. Michaelis of NIST [formerly 
the  National  Bureau  of  Standards  (NBS)]  Spectrographic  Standards  Laboratory  and  R.K. Bell  of  the  NBS 
Nonferrous Laboratory. 
 
Analyses  for  certification  were  performed  by  the  following  collaborating  laboratories:    General  Motors  Corp., 
Chemistry Department (Detroit, MI, USA), M.D. Cooper, R.L. Chance, A.H. Jones, R.E. Kohn, and R.B. Loranger; 
The  New  Jersey  Zinc  Co.  (Palmerton,  PA,  USA),  S.N. Roeder;  Apex  Smelting  Co.  (Cleveland,  Ohio,  USA), 
R.L. Vitek  and  J.W. Mierzwa;  Hudson  Bay  Mining  and  Smelting  Co.  Ltd.  (Flin  Fon,  Manitoba,  Canada), 
D.J. Robertson,  D.J. Sample,  L.S. Creighton;  and  Metal  &  Thermit  Corp.,  Research  Laboratory  (Rahway,  NJ, 
USA), M. Farnsworth and J.S. Pekola. 
 
Office  of  Reference
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Office  of  Reference 
Materials.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 
 
The certified portion of each sample is that part included in a region between 5 mm and 17 mm from each side of 
the square sample.  The center core (5 mm square) and the outer portion (from the edge inward 5 mm) may differ in 
composition and should not be used.  Within the bounds given above, the entire thickness (19 mm) of the sample is 
certified.  Each packaged sample has been prepared by finishing the test surface using a milling machine.  The user 
must determine the optimum surface preparation procedure for each analytical technique.  The user is cautioned to 
use care when either resurfacing the block or performing additional polishing as these processes may contaminate 
the surface.  For optical emission spectrometric methods, it is recommended that a single determination be based on 
the  average  value  from  at  least  six (6)  individual  “burns”  taken  within  the  certified  portion  of  the  sample.  
Specimens prepared for chemical methods of test should consist of either a cross-section piece or large chips taken 
from  the  certified  portion  of  the  sample.    Particular  care  should  be  given  to  obtain  complete  dissolution  of  the 
specimen  because  an  appreciable  part  of  some  elements  in  the  material  are  not  readily  soluble  in  simple  acid 
mixtures. 
 
Material Preparation(1):  The material for the preparation of this SRM was melted and cast at the National Lead 
Co.,  (Chicago,  IL)  under  a  cooperative  program  between  NBS  and  General  Motors  Corporation.    Homogeneity 
testing  of  selected  samples  from  the  SRM  lot  was  performed  by  R.C. Frank,  J.E. Dallemand,  and  D.L. Fry  of  the 
Research  Laboratories  Division  of  General  Motors  Corporation  and  by  the  NBS  Spectrographic  Standards 
Laboratory.

User  Experience  with  SRM 625:    This  alloy  is  known  to  be  heterogeneous  on  a  microscopic  level.    The 
The 
heterogeneity is observable when the alloy is measured using spark source optical emission spectrometry (SS-OES), 
for  example.    The  behavior  of  the  material  was  demonstrated  by  one  of  the  cooperating  laboratories  in  order  to 
define  the  certified  portion  of  a  single  unit  of  the  SRM.    To  indicate  the  level  of  heterogeneity,  Table 3  lists  the 
relative  standard  deviation  of  at  least  six  individual  spark  burns  for  the  certified  elements.    The  information 
provided  in  Table 3  is  for  guidance  and  is  not  certified.    Informational  values  cannot  be  used  to  establish 
metrological traceability.
