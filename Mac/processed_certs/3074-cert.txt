Certificate of Analysis 
Standard Reference Material 3074 

 

 
Phthalates in Methanol 
 
This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  a  solution  of  one  adipate  and  six  phthalates  in  methanol  intended 
primarily for use in the calibration of chromatographic instrumentation used for the determination of the certified 
components in the mixture.  Because of its miscibility with water, this SRM can also be used to fortify samples with 
known amounts of the six phthalates.  A unit of SRM 3074 consists of five 2 mL ampoules, each containing 1.2 mL 
of solution. 
 
Certified  Values:    The  certified  mass  fraction  and  mass  concentration  values  for  the  six  phthalates  are  given  in 
Table 1 [1,2].  These values are based on results obtained from the gravimetric preparation of this solution and from 
the  analytical  results  determined  by  using  gas  chromatography  with  mass  spectrometric  detection (GC/MS).    A 
NIST  certified  value  is  a  value  for  which  NIST  has  the  highest  confidence  in  its  accuracy  in  that  all  known  or 
suspected sources of bias have been investigated or accounted for by NIST. 
 
Supplemental Information:  Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) Registry Numbers of the certified components are 
listed in Table 1.  In addition to the six phthalates listed in Table 1, this solution contains bis(2-ethylhexyl)adipate 
(CAS  Registry  Number  103-23-1).    The  concentration  of  bis(2-ethylhexyl)  adipate  in  the  solution  has  decreased 
since the preparation of this solution, so it is not included as a certified value. 
 
Expiration  of  Certification:    The  certification  of  this  SRM 3074  is  valid,  within  the  measurement  uncertainties 
specified, until 30 March 2023 provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given in 
this  certificate  (see  “Instructions  for  Handling,  Storage,  and  Use”).    The  certification  is  nullified  if  the  SRM  is 
damaged, contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance  of  SRM  Certification:    NIST  will  monitor  this  SRM  over  the  period  of  its  certification.    If 
substantive  technical  changes  occur  that affect  the  certification before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST will 
notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
Coordination of the technical measurements leading to the certification was under the direction of M.M. Schantz and 
S.A. Wise of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division. 
 
Partial  support  for  the  preparation  and  certification  of  this  Standard  Reference  Material  was  provided  by  the 
U.S. Environmental  Protection  Agency  Office  of  Water,  Office  of  Enforcement  and  Compliance  Assurance,  and 
Office of Research and Development. 
 
Analytical measurements of the SRM were performed by B.A. Benner, Jr., C.R. Mack, and L.K. Walton of the NIST 
Chemical Sciences Division. 
 
Preparation  of  the  SRM  was  performed  by  B.A. Benner, Jr.  and  M.P. Cronise  of  the  NIST  Office  of  Reference 
Materials. 
 
Consultation  on  the  statistical  design  of  the  experimental  work  and  evaluation  of  the  data  were  provided  by 
S.D. Leigh of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division. 
 
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Office  of  Reference 
Materials.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
CAUTION:    This  SRM  is  sealed  in  glass  ampoules  with  prescored  stems.    All  appropriate  safety  precautions, 
including use of gloves during handling, should be taken.  Unopened ampoules should be stored upright inside the 
original container supplied by NIST under normal laboratory conditions. 
 
Handling:  This material contains phthalates and an adipate and should be handled with care.  Use proper disposal 
methods. 
 
Storage:  Sealed ampoules, as received, should be stored in the dark at temperatures lower than 30 °C. 
 
Use:  Sample aliquots for analysis should be withdrawn at 20 °C to 25 °C immediately after opening the ampoules 
and should be processed without delay for the certified values to be valid within the stated uncertainty.  Because of 
the volatility of methanol, certified values are not applicable to material stored in ampoules that have been opened 
for more than 5 minutes, even if they are resealed. 
 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS 
 
Preparation:    The  six  phthalates  and  one  adipate  used  in  the  preparation  of  this  SRM  were  obtained  from  a 
commercial source. The weighed components were added to the methanol and mixed until completely dissolved and 
homogenized.  The total mass of this solution was measured and the mass fractions and mass concentrations were 
calculated  from  this  gravimetric  procedure.    The  gravimetric  values  were  adjusted  for  the  consensus  purity 
estimation  of  each  component,  which  was  determined  using  capillary  gas  chromatography  with  flame  ionization 
detection  and  differential  scanning  calorimetry.    This  bulk  solution  was  then  chilled  to  approximately  –5 °C  and 
1.2 mL aliquots were dispensed into 2 mL amber glass ampoules, which were flame sealed. 
 
Analysis:  Aliquots from nine ampoules, selected according to a stratified, random sampling scheme, were analyzed 
in  duplicate  using  GC/MS  employing  an  immobilized  nonpolar  (5 %  phenylmethylpolysiloxane)  stationary  phase 
column (see Figure 1).  An internal standard solution containing six ring-d4 phthalates was added to each sample for 
quantification purposes.  Calibration solutions consisting of weighed amounts of the six phthalates and one adipate 
and the ring-d4 phthalate internal standard compounds in methanol were chromatographically analyzed to determine 
analyte response factors. 
 
Certified  Mass  Fraction  Values:    The  certified  mass  fraction  values  are  expressed  as  the  certified  value    an 
expanded uncertainty.  The certified value is the unweighted average of the mass fractions determined by gravimetry 
and  chromatographic  measurements.    The  expanded  uncertainty,  at  the  95 %  level  of  confidence,  is  calculated  as 
U = kuc  where  uc  is  a  combined  standard  uncertainty  calculated  according  to  the  ISO  Guide [3]  and  k = 2  is  the 
coverage factor.  The value of uc  includes both a correction for estimated purity and an allowance for differences 
between the mass fractions determined by gravimetric preparation and chromatographic measurements. 
 
Certified  Mass  Concentration  Values:    The  certified  mass  concentration  values (in  mg/L)  were  obtained  by 
multiplying the certified mass fraction by the measured density of the SRM solution at 22 °C (0.7914 g/mL).  This 
concentration is for use over the temperature range of 20 °C to 25 °C, and an allowance for the change in density 
over this temperature range is included in the uncertainty.
