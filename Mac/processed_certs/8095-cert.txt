Si1-xGex Films on Si 

 
This  Reference  Material (RM)  is  intended  to  provide  a  microanalysis  reference  standard  for  the  semiconductor 
industry,  primarily  for  secondary  ion  mass  spectrometry (SIMS)  analyses.    A  unit  of  RM 8095  consists  of 
two 1 cm × 1 cm  sections,  each  with  a  different  film  of  Si1-xGex  on  Si.    The  films  have  nominal  compositions  of 
10 %  (atom  fraction)  Ge  in  Si  (Si0.90Ge0.10)  and  25 %  (atom  fraction)  Ge  in  Si  (Si0.75Ge0.25).    This  Report  of 
Investigation applies to serial numbers 8095-1 through 8095-5. 
 
Reference  Values:    Reference  values  for  the  film  compositions  in  mass  fractions  are  provided  in  Table 1.  
Reference values are non-certified values that are the present best estimates of the true values.  However, the values 
do not meet the NIST criteria for certification and are provided with associated uncertainties that may not include all 
sources of uncertainty [1]. 
 
Information Values:  Information values for the Ge concentrations in atom fractions and atom fraction ratios are 
provided in Table 2.  An information value is considered to be a value that may be of interest to the RM user, but 
insufficient information is available to assess the uncertainty associated with the value [1]. 
 
Expiration of Value Assignment:  The reference values for RM 8095 are valid indefinitely, within the uncertainty 
specified, provided the RM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given in this certificate (see 
“Instructions Handling, Storage, and Use”).  Accordingly, periodic recalibration or recertification of this RM is not 
required.  The certification is nullified if the RM is damaged, contaminated or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of RM:  NIST will monitor this RM over the period of its validity.  If substantive technical changes 
occur  that  affect  the  value  assignment  before  the  expiration  of  this  report,  NIST  will  notify  the  purchaser.  
Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
The overall technical coordination for material procurement, processing and measurement activities was conducted 
by  S. Turner,  R.B. Marinenko,  D.S. Simons,  and  J.A. Small  of  the  NIST  Surface  and  Microanalysis  Science 
Division. 
 
Reference  and  information  value  measurements  and  sample  preparation  were  performed  by  R.B. Marinenko, 
D. Klinedinst, L.J. Richter, D.C. Meier, K.C.K. Scott, N.W.M. Ritchie, D.E. Newbury, S. Turner and E.S. Windsor 
of the NIST Surface and Microanalysis Division, R.L Zeisler, R.L. Paul, S.A. Rabb, L.L. Yu, and M.R. Winchester 
of the NIST Analytical Chemistry Division. 
 
SIMS  depth  profile  measurements  were  obtained  by  K.J. Kim,  guest  researcher  in  the  NIST  Surface  and 
Microanalysis Science Division and by T. Büyüklimanli of Evans Analytical Group (East Windsor, NJ).

INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 

Handling:  The film side of the two RM sections is the polished, reflective side.  These surfaces were cleaned by 
ultrasonification  in  acetone  and  isopropyl  alcohol  under  clean  room  conditions  prior  to  packaging.    Immediately 
prior to use, dust particles should be removed from the surface with a pressurized duster. 

Storage:  When not in use the RM should be stored in its original container.  

Use:  To use these films as composition reference materials for SIMS, the Ge compositions in atom fractions and the 
atom ratios of Table 2 should be utilized.  Note that the compositions of the films given in Tables 1 and 2 refer only 
to  the  portion  of  the  films  within  1.5 µmof  the  sample  surface  for  the  Si0.90Ge0.10  film  and  within  2.0 µm  of  the 
sample surface for the Si0.75Ge0.25 film. 

 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Material  Source  and  Preparation:    The  films  were  prepared  by  chemical  vapor  deposition  by  Advanced 
Semiconductor  Materials  America (ASM America),  Phoenix, AZ  with  nominal  compositions  of  10 %  (atom 
fraction) Ge in Si (Si0.90Ge0.10) and 25 % (atom fraction) Ge in Si (Si0.75Ge0.25) on 20 cm diameter Si wafers.  The 
nominal film thicknesses are 4 µm and 5 µm, respectively.  The Si wafers were cut in half.  One half of each wafer 
was sawed into 1 cm × 1 cm sections. 
 
Homogeneity  Testing:    Spectroscopic  ellipsometry  of  the  uncut  20 cm  wafer  showed  that  the  maximum  lateral 
chemical homogeneity occurred within approximately a 5 cm radius around the wafer center.  SIMS depth profiles 
showed that some changes occur in the films below 2 µm.  Some details of the depth profile analyses are given in 
the  Appendix  and  in  reference 3.    From  these  results  it  is  recommended  that  the  use  of  these  films  as  reference 
standards be restricted to a depth no greater than 1.5 µm for the Si0.90Ge0.10 film and 2.0 µm for the Si0.75Ge0.25 film. 
 
Five sections from each wafer were selected from the region of maximum chemical homogeneity for electron probe 
microanalysis (EPMA)  characterization.    Quantitative  chemical  homogeneity  of  the  films  was  tested  with 
wavelength  dispersive  spectrometer (WDS)  EPMA  using  thallium  acid  phthalate (TAP)  and  pentaerythritol (PET) 
crystals  to  acquire  X-ray  count  data  from  the  GeL  and  SiK  peaks,  respectively.    Tests  included  50 µm  linear 
traverses in 2 µm steps, random point analyses, and nested design experiments in which 10 randomly-selected points 
were each sampled three times on each of the five specimens taken from the two film wafers.  The nested design 
experiment  was  used  to  determine  the  within-specimen,  between-specimen,  and  measurement  heterogeneity 
uncertainties.  The combined expanded heterogeneity uncertainty, 2W, for Si0.90Ge0.10 was determined to be 1.04 % 
mass  fraction  (relative)  for  Ge  and  0.68 %  mass  fraction  (relative)  for  Si;  the  combined  expanded  heterogeneity 
uncertainty,  2W,  for  Si0.75Ge0.25  was  determined  to  be  0.94 %  mass  fraction (relative)  for  Ge  and  1.48 %  mass 
fraction (relative) for Si.  A table with further details of the homogeneity testing results is given in the Appendix.  
Details of the testing procedures and analyses can be found in recent publications [2,3]. 
 
Quantification:  The films were analyzed at 15 kV and 20 kV with WDS EPMA using the SiKα and GeKα X-ray 
lines [3] with PET and LiF crystals, respectively.  Five points were sampled at 15 kV, and 10 points were sampled at 
20 kV  on  each  of  five  specimens  from  each  film.    Data  were  quantified  with  the  Love-Scott II  matrix  correction 
procedure [4] using X-ray form factor, attenuation and scattering tables (FFAST) mass absorption coefficients [5].  
Pure  element  wafers  and  a  Si0.86Ge0.14  boule  were  used  as  reference  standards.    The  characterization  of  the 
Si0.86Ge0.14 boule was reported [6] and the expanded overall heterogeneity uncertainty, 2W, was determined to be 
0.92 %  mass  fraction (relative)  for  Ge  and  0.81 %  mass  fraction (relative)  for  Si.    The  Ge  composition  was 
determined  by  inductively  coupled  plasma  optical  emission  spectrometry (ICP-OES)  and  instrumental  neutron 
activation analysis (INAA) to be 30.228 % mass fraction with an expanded uncertainty of the mean of 0.195 % mass 
fraction [6].   The Ge  and  Si concentrations  calculated for  both films  are  consistent  at both 15 kV  and 20 kV,  and 
they are consistent using both the pure elements and the Si0.86Ge0.14 boule as reference standards.  The mass balance 
for the two elements in the films is less than 100 % mass fraction.  The reasons are not fully evident without further 
investigation.  A short description of work done to investigate the lack of mass balance is given in the Appendix and 
further details are given in reference 3. 
 
 
 
                                                 

(1)  Certain  commercial  equipment,  instruments  or  materials  are  identified  in  this  report  to  adequately  specify  the 
experimental  procedure.  Such  identification  does  not  imply  recommendation  or  endorsement  by  the  National  Institute  of 
Standards and Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the 
purpose.

(a) The reference values for Si and Ge mass fraction, in %, are a weighted mean of the results from EPMA obtained under four 
experimental  conditions.    The  uncertainties  for  the  elemental  values  are  an  expanded  uncertainty  about  the  mean  with 
coverage factor 2, calculated by combining variance between experimental conditions [7-9] with a pooled variance across 
the  four  experimental  conditions  following  the  ISO  Guide [10].    Relative  expanded  uncertainties  are  provided  in 
parentheses.  Uncertainties for data collected under each experimental condition are given in reference 3. 

(b) The uncertainties for the total values are calculated from propagation of uncertainty.  Relative expanded uncertainties for 

the total values are provided in parentheses. 

(c) The  uncertainties  reported  here are  slightly  different  from  those reported  in  reference 3  due  to the  recent  adoption  of  an 

updated procedure for calculating uncertainties from different sources [7-9].

(a) The information values for Ge atom fraction and Ge/Si atom ratio were obtained by normalizing the mass fraction values in 
Table 1.    The  Si  and  Ge  mass  fractions  for  a  given  film  were  multiplied  by  a  common  scaling  factor  so  that  their 
normalized mass fractions total 100 %.  The normalized mass fraction ratios were divided by the atomic weight ratio of the 
two  elements  to  obtain  the  atom  fraction  ratios  and  from  these  values  the  atom  fractions  of  Ge  for  the  two  films  were 
calculated.    The  uncertainties  were  obtained  using  a  Monte  Carlo  procedure  based  on  the  mass  fraction  uncertainties  of 
Table 1.    The  uncertainties  are  an  expanded  uncertainty  about  the  mean  with  a  coverage  factor 2.    Relative  expanded 
uncertainties for the total values are provided in parentheses.

Depth Profiles:  An example SIMS depth profile plot for a Si0.75Ge0.25 film specimen is given in Figure A1 below.  
Below  2 µm,  gradual  concentration  changes  occur.    In  the  six  Si0.75Ge0.25  specimens  measured,  the  Ge/Si  ratio 
increased by 2.9 %  0.9 % (1) at a depth interval of 3 µm to 4 µm relative to a depth interval of 0.5 µm to 2 µm.  
For the Si0.90Ge0.10 specimens, this transition was negative, 1.6 %  0.8 % (1) for a depth interval of 2 µm to 3 µm 
relative to a depth interval of 0.5 µm to 1.5 µm.  Further details of analyses are given in reference 3. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure A1.  SIMS depth profile plot of Ge/Si ratio vs. depth for a Si0.75Ge0.25 film specimen.  The ratio in this sample 
is constant to about a depth of about 2 µm and then increases by 2.9 % over an interval of about 1 µm after which it 
appears to remain constant down to the film-Si interface.  The ratio change near the top surface is a SIMS-related 
artifact.

Mass  Balance:    The  lack  of  mass  balance  in  these  films  may  be  caused  by  physical  characteristics,  such  as  very 
small voids in the films, vacancies in the lattice, or a density that is different from the SiGe boule that was used as a 
standard.  INAA, Auger spectrometry, and FIB SEM analyses were used to evaluate these possibilities.  Impurities 
are known to be present.  Traces of carbon and oxygen were observed in 2000s, 10 kV EDS spectra of both films, 
but these elements were also observed in EDS spectra of the pure Si and Ge wafers used as reference materials for 
the quantification.  Oxygen (atom fraction > 10 %) and some carbon were detected on the surfaces of the films to 
depths  from  3 nm  to  6 nm  with  field  emission  Auger  electron  spectroscopy,  and  a  NIST  Monte  Carlo [11] 
calculation determined that the amount of oxygen detected by Auger spectroscopy could be responsible for as much 
as  a 1 %  mass  fraction  loss of  GeK X-rays.   No  voids were  observed  in  the  FIB  SEM  work, so  if present,  they 
would  be  expected  to  be  at  the  atomic  level.    Some  work  may  be  done  in  the  future  with  the  analytical  electron 
microscope  to  investigate  the  structure  of  these  films  more  fully.    In  addition  to  the  possibilities  cited  above, 
elements may be present that could not be detected by EPMA.  Hydrogen was eliminated as a major contributor to 
the mass discrepancy by INAA where each film was determined to contain a hydrogen concentration < 1 µg/cm2.  
SIMS depth profiles obtained from Evans Analytical Group (East Windsor, NJ) of both films confirmed the INAA 
results.    Surface  concentrations  of  oxygen,  carbon,  and  hydrogen  decreased  to  0.0002 atom  fraction  or  less  at 
100 nm below the film surface, and both oxygen and carbon concentrations continued to decrease with depth.
