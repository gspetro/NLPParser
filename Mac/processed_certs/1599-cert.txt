Anticonvulsant ·Drug· Level  Assay· Standard 

This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is certified for the concentrations of two anti-convuls�nt drugs (valproic acid 
and carbamazepine) in a processed human serum base.  It is intended for use in the calibrati9n and standardization of 
procedures employed in clinical  laboratories for the determination of these drugs in  serum.  It can also be used for the 
critical evaluation  of  working or  secondary reference solutions  prepared either in-house or by a commercial  supplier. 
The certified concentrations apply to the two drugs after the serum is reconstituted following the procedures described on 
the back of this certificate. 

THIS  SRM  IS  INTENDED  FOR  "IN  VITRO"  DIAGNOSTIC  USE  ONLY.  HANDLE  AS  IF  CAPABLE  OF 
TRANSMITTING  HEPATITIS. 

This SRM is supplied as a set of four different freeze-dried preparations (three different concentrations and a blank).  It 
should be stored  in a refrigerator at a temperature of  about  4 ° C and should not be exposed to sunlight or ultraviolet 
radiation. 

The certified concentration levels are the average of the results of the two methods performed at NBS.  The range gives 
an indication of  the  uncertainty of  the  certified  value.

The analytical techniques used in the certification of this SRM were high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), 
calibrated  with  external  standards  for  determination  of carbamazepine and internal standards  for determination of 
valproic acid, and gas chromatography (GC), calibrated by bracketing with internal standards for both compounds.  The 
results obtained by these methods and their uncertainties (expressed as the standard deviations of the mean concentra­
tions)  are  given  below:

A  stratified  sampling  plan  was  used to test  for  homogeneity  in which refractive index  measurements  were  made on 
reconstituted  material.  These  measurements indicated that  the homogeneity  was  acceptable,  the  standard deviation 
(n=60)  being less  than 0.6  percent  of the  concentration  level. 

The modified  human  serum  base was  obtained  from  Seraplex,  Inc.,  Arcadia, California.  Drugs were added by NBS 
personnel and  the serum  was  then  processed,  vialed,  and  packaged by M.A.  Bioproducts,  Walkersville,  Maryland. 
Analyses leading to certification were performed in the Center for Analytical Chemistry by D.P. Enagonio, W.F. Kline, 
W.E.  May, R.G.  Christensen,  and  D.J.  Reeder. 

Measurements made at  the  University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, by D.L.  Bius,  K. Dudley and co-workers using 
a gas chromatography method commonly used in clinical laboratories  gave the  following results:

Good agreement  with the certified values was obtained by J.  Burd, Miles Laboratories, Elkhart, Indiana; H. Kupferberg, 
NIN CDS,  Bethesda, Maryland; M.R. Lohff, The Pathology Center, Omaha, Nebraska; and G. Szabo, Veterans Admin­
istration  Hospital,  Boston.  Massachusetts. 

Source material from which this serum base was derived was found non-reactive for Hepatitis B antigen when tested with 
licensed third-generation  reagents.  No known test method can provide complete assurance that products derived from 
human blood will not transmit  hepatitis. 

For use, it  is necessary to reconstitute the freeze-dried materials with high-purity water.  When a vial is opened, remove 
the rubber stopper carefully so as not to dislodge any serum particles that may adhere to the stopper.  Add 5.00 ± 0.01 mL 
of water to the vial from a calibrated volumetric pipet or other dispenser.  Replace the stopper, and allow the contents to 
stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.  Finally,  mix the contents by gently,swirling while inverting to wet all surfaces. 
DO  NOT  shake vigorously  because  denaturation and  frothing  may result. 

After  reconstitution,  the  contents should  be  used  within  one day;  otherwise  the  certified  values  cannot be  assured 
because of the  possible deterioration of the drugs  or the degradation of  the serum base. 

When properly stored, this SRM is expected to be stable for at least 2 years.  Samples will be monitored and if evidence of 
degradation  of  the  certified values occurs,  the  purchasers  will  be  notified. 

This  Standard  Reference  Material  has  been  measured  and  certified  at  the  laboratories  of the  National  Bureau  of 
Standards.  All inquires  should be  addressed  to:
