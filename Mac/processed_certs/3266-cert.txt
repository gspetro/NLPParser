Standard Reference Material® 3266 

 

 

 

Hypericin Calibration Solution 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) consists of a solution of hypericin in methanol with approximately 1.4 % 
(mass fraction) pyridine.  SRM 3266 is intended primarily for use in calibration of instruments and techniques used 
for the determination of hypericin.  A unit consists of five 2 mL ampoules, each containing approximately 1.2 mL of 
the hypericin solution. 
 
Development of SRM 3266 was a collaboration between the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 
and the National Institutes of Health, Office of Dietary Supplements (NIH ODS). 
 
Certified Values:  The certified values for hypericin are based on the masses used in the gravimetric preparation of 
the  solution  and  from  the  analytical  results  determined  using  liquid  chromatography  with  absorbance 
detection (LC-abs) and liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (LC-MS).  A NIST certified value 
is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias 
have  been  investigated  or  taken  into  account [1].    Values  are  provided  in  mass  fraction  units (mg/g)  and  mass 
concentration units (mg/mL) [2].  The mass concentration was obtained by multiplying the certified value in mass 
fraction units by the density of the solution at 21 °C (0.79301 mg/mL).  The uncertainty provided with each value is 
an  expanded  uncertainty  about  the  mean  to  cover  the  measurand  with  approximately  95 %  confidence.    The 
expanded  uncertainty  is  calculated  as  U = kuc,  where  uc  incorporates  the  observed  difference  between  the  results 
from the methods and their respective uncertainties, as well as uncertainty related to purity correction, consistently 
with the ISO Guide and with its Supplement 1, and k = 2 is a coverage factor corresponding to approximately 95 %  
confidence [3-5].    The  expanded  uncertainty  for  the  mass  concentration  incorporates  additional  uncertainty 
components  related  to  density  measurement  and  variability  of  density  due  to  changes  in  temperature  over  the 
interval 18 °C to 24 °C.

Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 3266 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until  01 January 2017,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  instructions  given  in  this 
certificate (see “Instructions for Handling, Storage, and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, 
contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance  of  SRM  Certification:    NIST  will  monitor  this  SRM  over  the  period  of  its  certification.    If 
substantive  technical  changes  occur  that affect  the  certification before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST will 
notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
Support for the development of SRM 3266 was provided in part by NIH ODS.  Technical consultation was provided 
by J.M. Betz (NIH ODS). 
 
The overall direction and coordination of the technical measurements leading to the certification of this SRM were 
performed by L.C. Sander, K.E. Sharpless, and S.A. Wise of the NIST Analytical Chemistry Division. 
 
Preparation  of  the  SRM  solution  and  analytical  measurements  were  performed  by  R. Lieberman  of  the  NIST 
Analytical Chemistry Division.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
Handling:  This SRM consists of a solution of methanol, pyridine, and hypericin contained in tip-sealed borosilicate 
glass ampoules with pre-scored stems.  Therefore, all appropriate safety precautions, including use of gloves during 
handling, should be taken.  Unopened ampoules should be stored under normal laboratory conditions in an upright 
position inside the original container supplied by NIST. 
 
Storage:  Sealed ampoules, as received, should be stored in the dark at temperatures at or below –20 °C. 
 
Use:    Prior  to  removal  of  a  test  portion  for  analysis,  an  ampoule  of  the  SRM  should  be  equilibrated  to  room 
temperature  and  the  contents  mixed  thoroughly.    Test  portions  for  use  should  be  withdrawn  immediately  after 
opening the ampoules, and should be processed or diluted without delay for the certified value to be valid within the 
stated uncertainty.  The stability of hypericin in previously opened and stored ampoules has not been investigated. 
 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS(1) 

Solution Preparation:  The solution was prepared gravimetrically at NIST from methanol and a primary standard 
for  hypericin  obtained  from  Blaze  Science  Industries  LLC  (Lawndale, CA).    The  solution  was  mixed  overnight 
(18 h)  and  aliquoted  into  2 mL  amber  glass  ampoules  that  had  been  purged  with  argon  prior  to  addition  of  the 
solution.    The  ampoules  were  then  flame-sealed.    The  masses  of  the  primary  standards  and  the  total  mass  of  the 
solution  were  used  to  calculate  the  gravimetric  mass  fraction.    The  mass  fraction  was  adjusted  for  the  purity 
estimates of the primary standard, which was determined using liquid chromatography with ultraviolet and visible 
detection at 210 nm, 270 nm, and 590 nm; Karl Fischer titration; and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). 
 
Analytical  Approach:    Aliquots  from  10 ampoules,  selected  using  a  stratified  random  sampling  scheme,  were 
analyzed  in  duplicate  using  LC-abs  at  590 nm.    Four  independent  calibration  solutions  were  gravimetrically 
prepared.  For LC-abs, an external standard calibration approach was used.  A representative chromatogram and the 
separation conditions are presented in Figure 1.  A second set of aliquots from 10 ampoules, also selected using a 
stratified  random  sampling  scheme,  were  analyzed  in  duplicate  using  LC-MS.    Rhodamine 6G  was  used  as  an 
internal standard. 
 
Homogeneity  Assessment:    The  homogeneity  of  hypericin  mass  fractions  was  assessed  at  NIST  by  using  the 
analytical  approach  described  above.    An  analysis  of  variance  did  not  show  inhomogeneity  for  the  test  portions 
analyzed. 
 
Value Assignment:  For calculation of assigned values, the mean of the available sets of data were averaged.  The 
certified value is the mean of the mass fraction determined by gravimetric preparation and the means from the two 
chromatographic methods.
