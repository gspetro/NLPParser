Standard Reference Material 1588c 

 

 
 

Organics in Fish Oil 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended primarily for use in developing and validating analytical methods 
for  the  determination  of  polychlorinated  biphenyls  (PCBs),  chlorinated  pesticides,  polybrominated  diphenyl 
ethers (PBDEs), and fatty acids in fish oils and similar materials.  SRM 1588c can also be used for quality assurance 
when assigning values to in-house reference materials.  A unit of SRM 1588c consists of five ampoules with each 
ampoule containing approximately 1.2 mL of fish oil. 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values:  Certified mass fraction values for 44 PCB congeners (one pair in combination), 
8 chlorinated pesticides, 7 PBDE congeners, and 18 fatty acids are provided in Tables 1 through 4, respectively.  A 
NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that all known or suspected 
sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [1].  Values are reported on an as-received basis in mass 
fraction units [2].  The measurands are the total mass fraction for the analytes listed in Tables 1 through 4 and are 
metrologically traceable to the SI unit for mass, expressed as micrograms per kilogram in Tables 1 through 3 and 
milligrams per gram in Table 4. 
 
Reference Mass Fraction Values:  Reference mass fraction values for 12 PCB congeners, 2 chlorinated pesticides, 
and 3 fatty acids are provided in Tables 5 through 7, respectively.  A NIST reference value is a noncertified value that 
is the best estimate of the true value based on available data; however, the value does not meet the NIST criteria for 
certification [1] and is provided with associated uncertainties that may reflect only measurement reproducibility, may 
not include all sources of uncertainty, or may reflect a lack of sufficient statistical agreement among multiple analytical 
methods.  Values are reported on an as-received basis in mass fraction units [2].  The measurand is the total mass 
fraction for the analytes listed in Tables 5 through 7 as determined by the methods indicated and is metrologically 
traceable to the SI unit for mass, expressed as micrograms per kilogram in Tables 5 and 6 and milligrams per gram in 
Table 7. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 1588c is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until 03 June 2015, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given in this certificate 
(see  “Instructions  for  Handling,  Storage,  and  Use”).    The  certification  is  nullified  if  the  SRM  is  damaged, 
contaminated, or otherwise modified.  
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register on-line) will facilitate notification. 
 
Coordination of the technical measurements leading to the certification of this SRM was performed by M.M. Schantz former 
of NIST and L.C. Sander of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division. 
 
Analytical measurements at NIST were performed by J. Hoguet, and C. Luvonga (formerly of NIST Analytical Sciences 
Division) and J.R. Kucklick, of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division and M.M. Schantz.

>  ampoule 

Source and Preparation:  This SRM is composed of menhaden oil (Brevoortia tyrannus) collected in 2003 and 2004 
from six rendering plants along the Southeast Atlantic and Gulf Coasts of the United States.  The oil was provided by 
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Centers for Coastal Ocean Research, Hollings Marine 
Laboratory, Charleston, SC.  The oil was filtered and mixed prior to ampouling.  Each 2-mL amber glass ampoule 
was purged with argon prior to addition of approximately 1.2 mL of oil.   
 
Analytical Approach for Determination of PCBs, Chlorinated Pesticides, and PBDEs:  Value assignment of PCB 
congener, chlorinated pesticide, and PBDE congener mass fractions in SRM 1588c was based on the combination of 
measurements made using multiple analytical methods at NIST, all of which were based on gas chromatography (GC) 
with mass spectrometric detection (MS) as described below. 
 
For  GC/MS  I,  two  0.5  g  test  portions  from  each  of  10  ampoules  of  SRM  1588c  were  combined  with  an  internal 
standard  solution  containing  carbon-13  labeled  4,4'-DDE,  4,4'-DDT,  γ-HCH,  trans-nonachlor,  PBDE  209,  and 
PCB 28, PCB 52, PCB 101, PCB 138, PCB 153, PCB 180, and PCB 209, and fluorinated PBDE congeners 47 and 208.  
Samples were mixed with hexane and sulfuric acid, followed by the separation and removal of the hexane phase.  The 
sulfuric  acid  layer  was  washed  an  additional  two  times  with  hexane.    The  hexane  phases  were  combined  and 
concentrated  to  approximately  0.5  mL.    The  concentrated  extracts  were  eluted  through  a  silica  solid-phase 
extraction (SPE) column using 20 mL of 10 % (volume fraction) methylene chloride in hexane.  The collected fractions 
were concentrated for GC/MS analysis.  The PCB congeners and chlorinated pesticides were quantified using GC/MS 
in  the  electron  ionization  (EI)  mode  with  a  0.25  mm  ×  60  m  fused  silica  capillary  column  containing  a 
50 % phenyl + 50 % methylpolysiloxane (mole fraction) phase.  The PBDE congeners were quantified using GC/MS 
in the negative chemical ionization (NCI) mode using a 0.25 mm × 15 m fused silica capillary column containing a 
50 % liquid crystal + 50 % methylpolysiloxane (mole fraction) phase.  A single internal standard solution was used 
for the calibrants and samples.  Quantitation was based on a calibration curve bracketing the concentrations in the oil 
samples. 
 
For GC/MS II, single 1 g test portions from each of six ampoules of SRM 1588c were combined with an internal 
standard solution containing deuterated 4,4'-DDD, carbon-13 labeled trans-chlordane, trans-nonachlor, oxychlordane, 
HCB, 4,4'-DDT, 4,4'-DDE, PBDE 209, PCB 28, PCB 52, PCB 77, PCB 188, PCB 126, PCB 153, PCB 169, PCB 180, 
PCB 194, PCB 206, PBDE 104, and fluorinated PBDE 47, 160, and 208.  The oil and internal standard were mixed 
with  sodium  sulfate  in  a  pressurized-fluid  extraction  (PFE)  cell.    The  PFE  conditions  were:  solvent,  methylene 
chloride;  cell  temperature,  100  °C;  equilibration  time,  5  min;  static  time,  5  min;  cell  pressure,  13.8  MPa;  and 
three cycles.  The extracts were concentrated to 1 mL for size exclusion chromatography (SEC).  SEC was performed 
using a preparative-scale column to remove the majority of the lipids and high molecular mass compounds.  The SEC 
fraction was concentrated and eluted through an alumina SPE column using 9 mL of 35 % (volume fraction) methylene 
chloride in hexane.  The SPE fractions were concentrated for GC/MS analysis.  GC/MS was run in the EI mode and 
NCI mode using a 0.18 mm × 30 m fused silica capillary column containing a 5 % phenyl + 95 % methylpolysiloxane 
(mole fraction) phase.  A single internal standard solution was used for the calibrants and samples.  Quantitation was 
based on a calibration curve bracketing the concentrations in the oil samples. 
 

                                                           

(1) Certain commercial equipment, instruments, or materials are identified in this certificate in order to specify adequately 
the  experimental  procedure.    Such  identification  does  not  imply  recommendation  or  endorsement  by  the  National  Institute  of 
Standards and Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the 
purpose.

Analytical Approach for Determination of Fatty Acids:  Value assignment of the concentrations of fatty acids in 
1588c was based on the combination of measurements made using two independent analytical methods at NIST:  GC 
with flame ionization detection (FID) and GC/MS as described below.   
 
For GC-FID, two 0.5 g test portions from each of 10 ampoules of SRM 1588c were combined with an internal standard 
solution  containing  octacosanoic  acid  and  myristic-d27  acid. 
[0.1  mol/L  methanolic 
(m-trifluoromethylphenyl) trimethylammonium hydroxide, Alltech, Deerfield, IL] and 2,2,4-trimethylpentane  were 
added stepwise  for conversion of fatty acids to their  methyl esters (FAMEs)  prior to analysis by GC-FID  using a 
0.25 mm × 100 m nonbonded biscyanopropyl polysiloxane fused silica capillary column.  Calibrants were prepared 
gravimetrically, at levels intended to approximate the levels of the fatty acids in the SRM.  A single internal standard 
solution  was  used  for  the  calibrants  and  samples.    Quantification  was  based  on  average  response  factors  for  the 
calibrants. 
   
For GC/MS, two 0.5 g test portions from each of 10 ampoules of SRM 1588c were combined with an internal standard 
solution  containing  octacosanoic  acid  and  myristic-d27  acid.    A  two-step  process  employing  methanolic  sodium 
hydroxide  and  boron  trifluoride  was  used  to  convert  the  fatty  acids  to  FAMEs.    GC/MS  was  performed  using  a 
0.25 mm  × 60  m fused silica capillary column containing  a  50 % cyanopropyl + 50 %  methylpolysiloxane (mole 
fraction) phase.  Calibrants were prepared gravimetrically, at levels intended to approximate the levels of the fatty 
acids in the SRM.  A single internal standard solution was used for the calibrants and samples.  Calculations are based 
on average response factors for the calibrants. 
 
Homogeneity Assessment:  The homogeneity of PCBs, chlorinated pesticides, and PBDEs  was assessed at NIST 
using the GC/MS I method described above, and the homogeneity of the fatty acids was assessed at NIST using the 
methods  and  test  portion  sizes  described  above.    The  analyses  of  variance  did  not  show  statistically  significant 
heterogeneity.   
 
Value Assignment:  For calculation of assigned values, the means of the individual sets of data were averaged.

(a) PCB congeners are numbered according to the scheme proposed by Ballschmiter and Zell [3] and later revised by Schulte and 

Malisch [4] to conform with IUPAC rules.   

(b) The  reference  mass  fraction  value  is  the  mean  of  results  obtained  using  one  analytical  technique, GC/MS  I.    The  expanded 
uncertainty,  U,  is  calculated  as  =  kuc,  where  uc  is  one  standard  deviation  of  the  analyte  mean,  and  the  coverage  factor,  k,  is 
determined from the Student’s t-distribution corresponding to 19 degrees of freedom and a 95 % confidence level for each analyte. 
(c) The reference  mass fraction value is the mean of results obtained using one analytical technique, GC/MS II.  The expanded 
uncertainty,  U,  is  calculated  as  =  kuc,  where  uc  is  one  standard  deviation  of  the  analyte  mean,  and  the  coverage  factor,  k,  is 
determined from the Student’s t-distribution corresponding to 5 degrees of freedom and a 95 % confidence level for each analyte. 

(d) PCB 196 and PCB 203 coeluted under the conditions used.
