Standard Reference Material® 1597a 

 

 

 
Complex Mixture of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons from Coal Tar 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended for use in the evaluation and validation of analytical methods 
for  the  determination  of  a  natural,  combustion-related  mixture  of  polycyclic  aromatic  hydrocarbons (PAHs).  
SRM 1597a is isolated from a coal tar sample and dissolved in toluene.  It is suitable for direct analysis (i.e., without 
sample  cleanup  or  concentration)  in  the  determination  of  PAHs  using  analytical  techniques  such  as  gas 
chromatography (GC),  liquid  chromatography (LC),  or  gas  chromatography/mass  spectrometry (GC/MS).    This 
SRM  may  also  be  used  to  evaluate  procedures  for  measurement  of  mutagenic  activity  of  combustion-related 
mixtures of PAHs and related compounds.  A unit of SRM 1597a consists of one 5 mL ampoule, containing 1.3 mL 
of material. 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values:  Certified values for concentrations, expressed as mass fractions, for 34 PAHs are 
provided in Table 1.  The certified values are based on the agreement of results obtained at NIST from two or more 
chemically  independent  analytical  techniques  [1,2].    A  NIST  certified  value  is  a  value  for  which  NIST  has  the 
highest confidence in its accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or accounted 
for by NIST.  
 
Reference Mass Fraction Values:  Reference values for concentrations, expressed as mass fractions, are provided 
for 36 additional PAHs in Table 2 and for 10 polycyclic aromatic sulfur heterocycles (PASH) in Table 3.  Reference 
values are given in Table 4 for the mutagenic activity of SRM 1597a.  Reference values are noncertified values that 
are the best estimate of the true value.  However, the values do not meet the NIST criteria for certification and are 
provided with associated uncertainties that may reflect only measurement precision, may not include all sources of 
uncertainty, or may reflect a lack of sufficient statistical agreement among multiple analytical methods.  
 
Expiration  of  Certification:    The  certification  of  SRM 1597a  is  valid,  within  the  measurement  uncertainty 
specified, until 01 October 2028, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given 
in this certificate (see “Instructions for Handling, Storage, and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is 
damaged, contaminated, or modified. 
 
Maintenance  of  SRM  Certification:    NIST  will  monitor  this  SRM  over  the  period  of  its  certification.    If 
substantive technical changes occur which affect the certification before the expiration of this certificate, NIST will 
notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
The coordination of the technical measurements leading to the certification of this material was under the leadership 
of M.M. Schantz and S.A. Wise of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division. 
 
The preparation of SRM 1597a was performed by S.A. Wise of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
Handling:  This material contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon compounds (many of which have been reported 
to have mutagenic and/or carcinogenic properties) in toluene and should be handled with care.  Use proper disposal 
methods.  See Material Safety Data Sheet for safe handling instructions. 
 
Storage:  The sealed ampoule, as received, should be stored in the dark at temperatures between 10 °C and 30 °C. 
 
Use:  Sample aliquots for analysis should be withdrawn at 20 °C to 25 °C immediately after opening the ampoule 
and should be processed without delay for the certified values in Table 1 to be valid within the stated uncertainty.  
Because of the volatility of toluene, certified values are not applicable to material stored in an ampoule that has been 
opened for more than 5 min, even if it is resealed.  Material may be transferred to a vial that can be sealed to prevent 
evaporation of the solvent. 
 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Sample  Preparation:  The  coal  tar  used  in  the  preparation  of  SRM 1597a  is  a  medium  crude  coke  oven  tar.  
Approximately  36 g  of  the  coal  tar  sample  was  processed  through  a  liquid  chromatographic  column  containing 
attapulgus clay to remove the highly polar constituents in the sample.  The column was eluted with approximately 
7 L  of  10 %  methylene  chloride  in  n-pentane,  and  the  eluant  was  collected  and  concentrated  until  a  thick  orange 
syrup  remained.    This  material  was  then  dissolved  in  approximately  4.5 L  of  toluene  and  aliquoted  into  a  5 mL 
amber ampoule.  An ampoule contains approximately 1.3 mL of solution, and the density of the solution at 23 °C is 
approximately 0.866 g/mL.  This material was originally issued in 1988 as SRM 1597 [3].  
 
Polycyclic  Aromatic  Hydrocarbons:    The  general  approach  used  for  the  value  assignment  of  the  PAHs  in 
SRM 1597a is similar to that reported for the recent certification of several environmental matrix SRMs [4–8] and 
consisted  of  combining  results  from  analyses  using  various  combinations  of  different  chromatographic  separation 
and  detection  techniques.    The  methods  utilized  analysis  by  GC/MS  on  four  stationary  phases  of  different 
selectivity,  i.e.,  a  5 %  (mole  fraction)  phenyl-substituted  methylpolysiloxane  phase,  a  50 %    phenyl-substituted 
methylpolysiloxane phase,  a  relatively  non-polar  proprietary  phase,  and a  liquid  crystalline  phase  and  analysis  by 
liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (LC-FL). 
 
Seven sets of GC/MS results, designated as GC/MS (Ia), (Ib), (IIa), (IIb), (IIIa), (IIIb), and (IV) were obtained using 
four columns with different selectivities for the separation of PAHs.  For the GC/MS (Ia), (Ib), (IIa), (IIb), (IIIa), and 
(IIIb) analyses, subsamples of approximately 0.5 mL (exact mass known) were used for analysis.  For GC/MS (IV), 
subsamples of approximately 0.25 mL (exact mass known) were used for analysis.  For methods GC/MS (Ia), (Ib), 
(IIIa), and (IIIb), the samples were analyzed without a pretreatment step.  For methods GC/MS (IIa) and (IIb), the 
coal  tar  samples  were  fractionated  on  a  semi-preparative  aminopropylsilane  column  (μBondapak  NH2, 
9 mm i.d.  30 cm, Waters Associates, Milford, MA) to isolate isomeric PAH fractions as described [3,9–11]. 
 
The  samples  were  then  analyzed  by  GC/MS  using  the  following  methods.    Methods  designated  as  GC/MS (Ia), 
GC/MS (IIa), GC/MS (IIIa), and GC/MS (IV) used a 0.25 mm i.d.  60 m fused silica capillary column with 50 % 
(mole fraction) phenyl-substituted methylpolysiloxane phase (0.25 μm film thickness) (DB-17MS, J&W Scientific, 
Folsom, CA).    For  GC/MS (Ib),  samples  were  analyzed  by  GC/MS  using  a  0.25 mm  i.d.  15 m  fused  silica 
capillary column with dimethyl 50 % (mole fraction) liquid crystalline polysiloxane phase (0.25 μm film thickness) 
(LC-50,  J&K  Environmental,  Sydney,  Nova  Scotia, Canada).    The  GC/MS (IIb)  analyses  were  performed  using  a 
0.25 mm i.d.  60 m fused silica capillary column with 5 % (mole fraction) phenyl-substituted methylpolysiloxane 
phase  (0.25 μm  film  thickness)  (DB-5MS,  J&W  Scientific,  Folsom, CA).    The  GC/MS (IIIb)  analyses  were 
performed  using  0.25 mm  i.d.  60 m  fused  silica  capillary  column  with  a  relatively  non-polar  proprietary  phase 
(0.25 μm film thickness) (DB-XLB, J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA). 
 
For the GC/MS measurements described above, selected perdeuterated PAHs were added to the coal tar for use as 
internal standards for quantification purposes. 

                                                           
 

(1) Certain commercial equipment, instrumentation, or materials are identified in this certificate to adequately specify the 
experimental  procedure.    Such  identification  does  not  imply  recommendation  or  endorsement  by  the  National  Institute  of 
Standards and Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the 
purpose.

In addition to the GC/MS methods, one LC-FL method was used [11] for the determination of PAHs of molecular 
mass 278 and 302.  For the LC-FL method, subsamples of 1 mL from four ampoules were spiked with an internal 
standard  solution  containing  selected  perdeuterated  PAHs.    These  samples  were  fractionated  using  the 
semi-preparative aminopropylsilane column described above.  The reversed-phase LC analyses of the fractions were 
performed on a polymeric C18 column (Vydac 201TP, The Separations Group, Hesperia, CA). 
 
Polycyclic  Aromatic  Sulfur  Heterocycles:    The  methods  used  for  the  value  assignment  of  the  PASHs  in 
SRM 1597a  are  summarized  in  detail  in  Mössner  and  Wise [12].    In  summary,  1 g  samples  of  SRM 1597a  were 
diluted  in  dichloromethane (DCM),  perdeuterated  internal  standard  solutions  were  added,  and  the  mixtures  were 
sonicated.  These samples were fractionated using the semi-preparative aminopropylsilane column described above.  
Two  subfractions  were  collected,  one  containing 
the 
benzonaphthothiophenes.  The samples were then analyzed by GC with atomic emission detection (GC-AED) and 
GC/MS  using  a  0.25 mm i.d.  60  m  fused  silica  capillary  column  with  5 %  (mole  fraction)  phenyl-substituted 
methylpolysiloxane  phase  (0.25 μm  film  thickness)  (DB-5MS)  and  a  0.25 mm i.d.   60 m  fused  silica  capillary 
column  with  50 %  (mole  fraction)  phenyl-substituted  methylpolysiloxane  phase  (0.25 μm  film  thickness) 
(DB-17MS). 
 
Mutagenic Activity of SRM 1597a:  The reference values for the mutagenic activity of this SRM were determined 
as  part  of  an  international  collaborative  study  sponsored  by  the  International  Programme  on  Chemical  Safety 
(IPCS).    The  IPCS  study  is  jointly  sponsored  by  the  World  Health  Organization (WHO),  the  United  Nations 
Environmental  Programme (UNEP),  and  the  International  Labor  Organization  (ILO).    The  program  was  initiated, 
supported, and technically coordinated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Health Research.  
Twenty  laboratories  from  North  America,  Europe,  and  Japan  participated  in  the  study  for  which  a  complete 
summary is available in references 13 and 14.  As part of the protocol, each laboratory solvent-exchanged an aliquot 
of  SRM 1597a  into  dimethylsulfoxide  prior  to  Salmonella/mammalian  microsomal  plate-incorporation  bioassay 
using strains TA98 and TA100 [15]. 
 
The  suggested  bioassay  reference  values  are  given  in  Table 4  in  both  rev/µL  and  rev/mg  units.    Two  types  of 
reference values are provided.  The first value is the best estimate of the mutagenic activity from the data available 
for a methylene chloride extract of SRM 1597a using the protocol specified for the IPCS collaborative study.  For 
the reference values to apply, the bioassay procedure should follow the Salmonella typhimurium plate incorporation 
protocol as described by Marion and Ames [15] and adhere to the guidelines published by Claxton et al. [16].   
 
The uncertainty in the mutagenic activity, expressed as the 95 % confidence limits about mean potency value, takes 
into account both between- and within-laboratory sources of variation.  While these confidence limits represent the 
uncertainty  for  the  best  estimate  of  the  mutagenic  activity  of  SRM 1597a,  they  do  not  reflect  the  variation  in  the 
values reported by individual participating laboratories.  They also do not represent the range of mutagenic activity 
values  from  other  laboratories  using  the  protocol  of  Maron  and  Ames [15]  with  some  additional  constraints [17].  
Tolerance  (prediction  or  control)  limits [18]  are  provided  to  characterize  differences  in  the  mutagenic  activity 
reported by the 20 laboratories that participated in the IPCS interlaboratory study and to establish a target range for 
other laboratories that analyze SRM 1597a using the modified Maron and Ames protocol.  Additionally, to assess 
values using the tolerance limits given, data should be treated using the same or very similar statistical methods as 
those used in this study [19,20]. 
 
The  “80 %  Tolerance  Limits”  is  the  range  within  which  80 %  of  the  mutagenic  activity  values  reported  in  the 
interlaboratory study are expected to reside.  These limits may be used by all laboratories using the IPCS Salmonella 
bioassay  protocol  to  determine  if  their  findings  are  consistent  with  those  reported  for  the  20 laboratories  that 
participated  in  the  IPCS  study.    Although  these  laboratories  may  not  be  representative  of  all  laboratories  that 
conduct  the  Salmonella  bioassay,  the  tolerance  limits  given  do  provide  a  range  of  values  that  all  laboratories 
following the IPCS protocol should strive to obtain.  The first set of tolerance limits given are for laboratories that 
use the same number of replicate extractions and bioassays as was performed in the IPCS collaborative study.  The 
second set of tolerance limits, which are slightly wider, apply to the case where only a single extraction and bioassay 
is performed.

(a) Reference  values  are  unweighted  means  of the results  from  two  to  four  analytical  methods.   The  uncertainty listed  with  the 
value  is  an  expanded  uncertainty  about  the  mean,  with  coverage  factor  2,  calculated  by  combining  a  between-method 
variance [22] with a pooled, within-method variance following the ISO Guide [2]. 

(b) GC/MS on a 50 % phenyl-substituted methylpolysiloxane phase. 
(c) GC-AED on a 50 % phenyl-substituted methylpolysiloxane phase. 
(d) GC/MS on a 5 % phenyl-substituted methylpolysiloxane phase. 
(e) GC-AED on a 5 % phenyl-substituted methylpolysiloxane phase.
