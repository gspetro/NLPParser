This Standard Reference Material
2,2,4-trimethylpentane (isooctane) intended primarily for use in the calibration of chromatog raphic instrumentation.  
A unit of SRM 2275 consists of five 2 mL ampoules, each containing approximately 1.2 mL of solution.  
 
Certified Concentrations of Constituent Pesticides:  
fractions, for  eight pesticides are given in Table  1. These values are based on results obtained from the gravimetric 
preparation of this solution and from the analytical results determined by using gas chromatography.  A NIST certified 
value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in  that all known or suspected sources of 
bias have been investigated or ac counted for by NIST  [1].   The measurands are listed in Table  1 and the certified 
values are metrologically traceable to the SI derived unit for mass fraction, expressed as milligrams per kilogram.  
 
Information  Values:   A summary of the gravimetric and gas
  chromatographic measurements for SRM  2275 is 
provided in Table 2.  This information is NOT to be used as a substitute for NIST certified values.  Information values 
cannot be used to establish metrological traceability. 
 
Additional Information :   Table 3 lists alternative names, Chemical Abstracts Service
 (CAS)  nomenclature, and 
registry numbers of the certified components.   Also, a representative chromatogram from the gas chromatographic 
analysis is shown in Figure l.  
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 2275 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until  31 January 2030, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given i
n this 
certificate (see “Instructions for  Handling, Storage, and  Use”). The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, 
contaminated, or otherwise modified.  
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical changes occur that affect the certification be

INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
Handling: This material contains chlorinated pesticide compounds, many of which have been reported to have toxic, 
mutagenic, and/or carcinogenic properties, and should be handled with care.  Use proper disposal methods. 
 
Storage:  Sealed ampoules, as received, should be stored in the dark at temperatures between 10 °C and 30 °C. 
 
Opening of Ampoule:  Open ampoules carefully to prevent contamination and injury.  The ampoules are pre-scored 
and should  NOT  be opened using a file.   Sample aliquots for analysis should be   withdrawn at 20  °C to 25  °C 
immediately after opening the ampoules and should be processed without delay for the certified values in Table 1 to 
be valid within the stated uncertainties.  Because of  the volatility of 2,2,4 -trimethylpentane, certified value s are not 
applicable to material stored in ampoules that have been opened for more than 5 minutes, even if they are resealed. 
 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS 
 
ce of Refer ence 
SRM Preparation:    Pesticides used in the preparation of this SRM were obtained from the Offi
 (United Kingdom ); Ultra Scientific  (North Kingston,  RI); and 
Materials, Laboratory of the Government Chemist
AccuStandard (New Haven, CT).  The pesticide solution was prepared at NIST by weighing and mixing the individual 
pesticides and 2,2,4-trimethylpentane.  The weighed components were added to the 2,2,4-trimethylpentane and mixed 
until completely dissolved and homogenized.  The total mass of this solution was  measured and the concentrations 
calculated for the components (see Table 2).  These gravimetric concentrations were adjusted for the consensus purity 
estimation of each component that was determine
detection, differential scanning calorimetry, and the purity assay information from the component suppliers.  This bulk 
solution was then chilled to approximately –5 °C and 1.2 mL aliquots were dispensed into 2 mL amber glass ampoules 
that were then flame sealed. 
 
SRM Analysis:  Aliquots from nine ampoules selected using a random  stratified sampling scheme were analyzed in 
duplicate by using capillary gas chromatography with electron capture detection employing an immobilized non-polar 
stationary phase column.  The two deuterated internal standards added to each 
sample for quantif ication purposes 
were: endosulfan -I-d4  and 4,4 '-DDT-d8.  Calibration solutions consisting of weighed amounts of the pesticides 
(adjusted for the consensus purity estimation) and internal standard comp
chromatographically  analyzed to determine analyte response factors.  The analytical values det
compounds also are given in Table 2.

(a) Each result is expressed as the certified value  ± the expanded uncertainty.  The certified value is the unweighted average of the 
concentrations determined by gravimetric and chromatographic measurements.  The  expanded uncertainty, at the 95 % level of 
confidence, is calculated as,  U = kuc, where  uc is a combined standard uncertainty calculated according to the ISO /JCGM and 
NIST Guides [2] and k = 2 is the coverage factor.  The value of uc includes both a correction for estimated purity and an allowance 
for differences between the concentration determined by gravimetric preparation and chromatographic measurements.
