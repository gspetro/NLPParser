Certificate of Analysis 
Standard Reference Material® 3274 

 

 
Botanical Oils Containing Omega-3 and Omega-6 Fatty Acids 

 
w

 
This  Standard  Reference  Material  (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  use  in  validating  analytical  methods  for  the 
determination of fatty acids in botanical oils and similar matrices.  This SRM can also be used for quality assurance 
when assigning values to in-house reference materials.  A unit of SRM 3274 consists of a total of four ampoules, one 
each  of  four  seed  oils:    (3274-1  Borage  [Borago  officinalis],  3274-2  Evening  Primrose  [Oenothera  biennis], 
3274-3 Flax [Linium usitatissimum], and 3274-4 Perilla [Perilla frutescens]).  Each ampoule contains approximately 
1.2 mL of oil under argon. 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values:  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its 
accuracy in that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [1].  The certified 
mass fraction values of selected fatty acids are provided in bold typeface in Table 1.  Values were derived from the 
combination of results provided by two or three analytical methods employed at NIST.  The certified values in this 
material  are  the  equally  weighted  means  of  the  individual  sets  of  data;  the  associated  uncertainties  are  expanded 
uncertainties at the 95 % level of confidence [2,3].  Values are reported on an “as-received” basis in mass fraction units [4]. 
 
Reference Mass Fraction Values:  Reference values are noncertified values that are the best estimate of the true 
values based on available data; however, the values do not meet the NIST criteria for certification and are provided 
with  associated  uncertainties  that  may  reflect  only  measurement  reproducibility,  may  not  include  all  sources  of 
uncertainty, or may reflect a lack of sufficient statistical agreement among multiple analytical methods [1].  Reference 
mass fraction values for additional fatty acids are provided in normal typeface in Table 1. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 3274 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
in  accordance  with  instructions  given  in  this 
until  28  February  2021,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  instructions  given  in  this 
certificate (see “Instructions for Storage and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, 
ataminated, 
or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Coordination of the technical measurements leading to the certification of this SRM was performed by L.C. Sander, 
K.E. Sharpless, and S.A. Wise of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division. 
 
Analytical measurements at NIST were performed by M.M. Schantz formerly of NIST. 
 
Acquisition and preparation of the material was coordinated by K.E. Sharpless.  Material preparation prior to 
ampouling was performed by M.C. Tims and R.J. Case of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division. 
 
The development of SRM 3274 was a collaboration between NIST and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Office 
of Dietary Supplements (ODS).  Technical consultation was provided by J. Betz of NIH-ODS. 
 
Statistical analysis was provided by J.H. Yen of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division. 
 
Support aspects involved with the certification and issuance of this SRM were coordinated through the NIST Office 
of Reference Materials.

STORAGE  AND 

NOTICE AND WARNING TO USERS 
 
WARNING:  FOR LABORATORY USE ONLY; NOT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE AND USE 
 
Storage:  The material should be stored under refrigeration (0 °C to 4 °C), in an unopened ampoule, until required for 
use. 
 
Use:  Prior to removal of a test portion for analysis, the contents of an ampoule of material should be allowed to warm 
to room temperature and mixed thoroughly.  (Solids that have precipitated during refrigeration should redissolve when 
the material reaches room temperature.)  Test portions used for fatty acid analyses described below were 0.5 g.  For 
certified values to be valid, test portions of at least 0.5 g should be used. 
 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Material Acquisition and Preparation:  Borage oil, evening primrose oil, flaxseed oil, and perilla oil from single 
  Individual  oils  were  combined  with 
lots  were  obtained  from  Arista  Industries,  Inc.,  (Wilton,  CT). 
tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), an antioxidant, to yield a final TBHQ concentration of approximately 190 mg/L.  To 
facilitate dissolution of the TBHQ, the mixture was stirred overnight, at room temperature, using a magnetic stir bar.  
SRM 3274 was ampouled under argon with each ampoule containing approximately 1.2 mL of oil. 
 
Analytical Approach for Determination of Fatty Acids:  Value assignment of the concentrations of the fatty acids 
in SRM 3274 was based on the combination of measurements from three different analytical methods at NIST:  a 
combination  of  two  independent  sample  preparation  methods  and  two  gas  chromatography  (GC)  methods  with 
different detection (i.e., flame ionization detection [FID] and mass spectrometry [MS] as described below). 
 
NIST ANALYSES FOR FATTY ACIDS 
 
Fatty acids were measured by using combinations of two sample preparation methods and two GC methods with FID 
or MS detection.  Six independently prepared calibrants were used for each of the methods.  Calibrants were prepared 
gravimetrically, at levels intended to approximate the levels of the fatty acids in the SRM.  A single internal standard 
solution containing stearic-d35 acid and myristic-d27 acid was used for the calibrants and samples.  Calculations are 
based on average response factors for the calibrants. 
 
Sample Preparation Method 1:  Two 0.5 g test portions from each of ten ampoules were combined with the internal 
standard  solution.    Approximately  0.5  mL  of  MethPrep  II  (0.1  mol/L  methanolic  [m-trifluoromethylphenyl]-
trimethylammonium hydroxide, Alltech; Deerfield, IL) was added, samples were mixed for 1 min, and allowed to 
stand for at least 30 min prior to addition of toluene and analysis by using GC-FID. 
 
Sample Preparation Method 2:  Two 0.5 g test portions from one ampoule and single 0.5 g test portions from each 
of another nine ampoules were combined with the internal standard.  A two-step process involving methanolic sodium 
hydroxide and boron trifluoride was used to convert the fatty acids to their methyl esters.  Methyl esters were extracted 
into hexane three times, and the combined hexane portions were concentrated to approximately 1 mL.  Following the 
addition of toluene, samples were analyzed by using GC/MS and GC-FID. 
 
GC  with  Flame  Ionization  Detection:    GC-FID  was  performed  using  a  0.25  mm  ×  100  m  biscyanopropyl 
polysiloxane fused silica capillary column.  A typical separation is provided in Appendix A. 
 
GC  with  Mass  Spectrometric  Detection:    GC/MS  was  performed  using  a  0.25  mm  ×  60  m  cyanopropyl  and 
phenylpolysiloxane fused silica capillary column.  The MS was operated in the scan mode (70 amu to 400 amu). 
 
Homogeneity Assessment:   The  homogeneity  of  fatty  acids  was  assessed  at  NIST  by  using  the  GC-FID  method 
ince  did  not  show  inhomogeneity  for  a  0.5 
described above.  An analysis of variance did not show inhomogeneity for a 0.5 g sample. 
 
ilable  for  that  analyte.  Each 
Value Assignment:  Each value is the equally weighted average of the method means available for that analyte.  Each 
method mean is the mean of the measurements for that analyte.  Certified values are means of either two or three 
method means.  A reference value may be based on one to three method means.  The uncertainty of each value is 
estimated following the method in the ISO/JCGM Guide [2].

ty  in  each  value,  calculated  according  to  the  method  described 
(a)  Each certified and reference mass fraction value is an equally weighted mean of the results provided by NIST.  The uncertainty in each value, calculated according to the method described 
in the ISO/JCGM Guide [2,3], is expressed as an expanded uncertainty, U.  The expanded uncertainty is calculated as U = kuc, where uc is intended to represent, at the level of one standard 
deviation, the combined effect of between-laboratory and within-laboratory components of uncertainty.  The coverage factor (k) is determined from the Student's t-distribution corresponding 
to the appropriate associated degrees of freedom and approximately 95 % confidence for each analyte.  All certified and reference values are based on results from three methods (GC-FID 
using sample preparation methods 1 and 2 [GC-FID1 and GC-FID2, respectively] and GC/MS) except as indicated below.  The measurands for the certified values are mass fractions 
as  determined  by  the  methods  indicated  above.  The  values  are 
reported in bold in Table 1; the measurands for the reference values are the mass fractions in Table 1, normal font, and are as determined by the methods indicated above.  The values are 
metrologically traceable to the SI unit of mass.
