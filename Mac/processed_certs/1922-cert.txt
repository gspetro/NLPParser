Standard Reference Material® 1922 
 
Liquid Refractive Index - Mineral Oil 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended for use as a calibration material for refractometers, especially 
for  the  refractive  index  range  applicable  to  solutions  of  sugar  and  water.    A  unit  of  SRM  1922  is  a  mineral  oil 
characterized for refractive index, n, in the visible light range, and consists of one bottle of approximately 30 mL of 
liquid. Certified values are given in Table 1 for the refractive indices at six wavelengths, λ, at 20 °C, and for the 
change in n with respect to temperature, dn/dT.  
 
Certified  Values  and  Uncertainties:    The  measurements  of  refractive  index  were  conducted  on  a  precision 
spectrometer-goniometer  using  the  classical  method  of  minimum  deviation  [1,2].    A  cadmium  lamp  was  used  for 
measurements at 643.8 nm, 508.6 nm, 480.0 nm, and 467.8 nm, and a mercury lamp was used for measurements at 
546.1 nm.  The measurements were performed at a series of temperatures between 15 °C and 35 °C.  The mineral oil 
was contained in a hollow prism and the temperature was controlled by a water bath.   
 
The  uncertainties  of  the  temperature  measurements  are  estimated  to  be  on  the  order  of  ±  0.1  °C.    The  refractive 
indices at 20 °C and the slopes (dn/dT) were determined by linear fits to the measured data.  The certified values at 
589.3  nm  were  determined  by  fits  of  a  standard  dispersion  (Cauchy)  equation  to  the  refractive  index  and  dn/dT 
values  derived  from  the  linear  regressions.    The  homogeneity  of  the  oil  was  tested  by  measurements  on  multiple 
aliquots,  using  both  the  minimum  deviation  technique  and  an  Abbϑ-type  refractometer.    Uncertainties  in  the 
certified  values  were  calculated  in  accordance  with  NIST  policy  [3-4]  and  are  expanded  uncertainties  with  a 
coverage factor k = 2 incorporating a Type B error in temperature of ± 0.1 °C. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 1922 is valid indefinitely, within the uncertainty specified, 
provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  given  in  this  certificate  (see 
“Instructions for Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance  of  SRM  Certification:    NIST  will  monitor  this  SRM  over  the  period  of  its  certification.    If 
substantive technical changes occur that affect the certification before the expiration of this certificate, NIST will 
notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate this notification. 
 
The  overall  direction  and  coordination  of  the  technical  measurements  leading  to  certification  was  provided  by 
J.R. Verkouteren and R.A. Velapoldi of the NIST Surface and Microanalysis Science Division. 
 
Characterization  of  this  SRM  was  performed  in  the  NIST  Surface  and  Microanalysis  Science  Division  by 
J.R. Verkouteren. 
 
Statistical analysis was provided by S.D. Leigh of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division. 
 
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the NIST Measurement Services 
Division.

(a) The refractive index corresponds to approximately 71.6 on the Brix scale. 
(b) By  convention,  the  most  common  wavelength  for  reporting  refractive  index  is  589.3  nm,  the  intensity-weighted  mean 

wavelength of the sodium doublet, D1, D2. 

 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 
 
Use a clean glass pipette or dropper to extract a few drops of oil from the bottle to place on the measuring surface of 
the  refractometer.    Measure  the  refractive  index,  n,  at  one  of  the  wavelengths,  λ,  given  in  Table  1  and  at  a 
λn   by  using  Equation  1  and  the temperature 
coefficient, dnλ/dT, from Table 1.  (Temperatures above 20 °C will decrease the refractive index, and temperatures 
below 20 °C will increase the refractive index.)

The uncertainty in the measured value will be a combination of errors arising from the measurements of refractive 
index and temperature and the uncertainty in dn/dT.  The total uncertainty can be estimated by using a first order 
propagation of error [5]:

is the standard error in the measured refractive index,  s20-T is equivalent to the standard error in T, and 

λns
is one-half the uncertainty in dnλ/dT from Table 1.  If the standard error in the measured refractive index 

is ± 1×10-4, then the error derived from measurements at temperatures other than 20 °C (but within the range 
15  °C  to  35  °C)  will  be  very  small  with  respect  to  the  total  uncertainty.    The  error  in  the  measurement  of  T, 
however, can contribute significantly to the total uncertainty.  For example, given the calibration procedure from 
the example with T = 28.0 °C ± 0.1 °C and a measured            = 1.4665 ± 0.0001, the uncertainty is:

Given the same example with a standard error in T of ± 0.5 °C increases U to ± 0.0002.  This approach is not meant 
to be descriptive of all errors expected in the use of SRM 1922, but is useful for gauging the errors associated, in 
particular, with the measurement of temperature. 
 
Source, Preparation, and Analysis1 
 
The  mineral  oil  is  a  commercial  non-volatile  paraffin  oil  and  is  expected  to  be  very  stable  with  respect  to 
composition.  The oil was supplied in a 20 L container and aliquoted into amber glass bottles with Teflon-lined lids.  
Each bottle contains approximately 30 mL of oil.  
 
Storage and Handling:  This SRM should be stored in its original bottle at normal ambient temperatures between 
approximately 20 °C and 25 °C.  It must be tightly recapped after use and protected from excessive moisture and 
light.
