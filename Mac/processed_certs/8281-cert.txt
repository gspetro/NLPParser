Report of Investigation 
Reference Material 8281 
 
Single-Wall Carbon Nanotubes 
-Resolved  Populations) 
(Dispersed, Three Length-Resolved Populations) 

 

 
This  Reference  Material (RM)  is  intended  to  provide  a  common  set  of  single-wall  carbon  nanotube (SWCNT) 
dispersions of varying aspect ratios and purity for measurement comparisons.  A unit of RM 8281 consists of four 
ampoules,  three  of  the  ampoules  contain  a  single  dispersion  of  average  length  SWCNTs  and  are  labeled  Long, 
Medium, and Short according to the population present in surfactant solution and the fourth ampoule labeled Blank 
which contains only surfactant solution.  The surfactant is sodium deoxycholate and is present at a concentration of 
approximately 10 g/L in each of the four ampoules.  Each ampoule contains approximately 2.5 mL of solution.  The 
surfactant solution is  subjected to the same processing as the  nanotube dispersions and  is included as a blank;  no 
reference values are provided for this sample. 
 
Reference  Values:    Reference  values  are  provided  in  Table 1,  for  the  ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis)  absorbance  at 
specific wavelengths, and in Table 2 and 3 for the Raman G/D and G′/G ratios measured at 514.5 nm excitation for 
each nanotube population, respectively.  Reference values are noncertified values that are the best estimate of the true 
value; however, the values do not meet the NIST criteria for certification [1]. 
  
Additional User Information:  Spectra, images, and micrographs are provided in Figure 1 through 6.  This additional 
information is considered to be of interest to the RM user. 
 
Expiration  of  Value  Assignment:    RM 8281  is  valid,  within  the  measurement  uncertainty  specified,  until 
31 January 2023,  provided  the  RM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  instructions  given  in  this  report 
(see “Instructions for Use”).  This report is nullified if the RM is damaged, contaminated, or otherwise modified.

NOTICE AND WARNING TO USERS 
 
This  material  should  be  handled  as  recommended  by  the  National  Institute  for  Occupational  Safety  and 
Health (NIOSH).    According  to  NIOSH,  currently  there  are  no  studies  reported  in  the  literature  of  adverse  health 
effects in workers producing or using carbon nanotubes or carbon nanofibers.  The concern about worker exposure to 
these materials arises from results of animal studies.  Several studies in rodents have shown an equal or greater potency 
of carbon nanotubes compared to other inhaled particles known to be hazardous to exposed workers in causing adverse 
lung effects including pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis [2].  Currently, the adverse effects of skin penetration or 
ingestion of nanoparticles have not been fully studied.  For further information, refer to the Safety Data Sheet (SDS). 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 
 
Individual ampoules of the SWCNT dispersion can be opened by holding the ampoule and applying pressure to the 
head of the ampoules above the score line.  Opened ampoules should no longer be considered sterile, and the contents 
should be transferred to a clean, sealable, container for use subsequent to immediate withdrawal.  Opened samples 
can be stored under refrigeration to slow bacterial growth; however, freezing conditions should be avoided.   
 
The  dispersant,  sodium  deoxycholate,  is  not  compatible  for  direct  use  in  many  biological  studies.    The  surfactant 
solution containing the nanotubes can be exchanged using filtration or dialysis using membranes rated for between 
10 kDa MW and 100 kDa MW if needed for other measurements; a sufficient amount of dispersant must be present 
with the nanotubes at all times to maintain dispersion.  However, the reference values are not valid after any exchange 
of dispersant or additional processing. 
 
Stability:  This material is considered stable when stored at room temperature and protected from exposure to strong 
ultraviolet radiation.  However, its stability has not been rigorously assessed. 
 
PREPARATION 
 
ifter 
The nanotube length populations were produced through a centrifugation-based length separation method [3].  After 
the separation, multiple length fractions were combined to form the three populations that comprise the RM.  The 
dispersing medium was exchanged with fresh surfactant solution for each the three nanotube populations.  The samples 
and Blank were dispensed into pre-cleaned glass ampules under an argon gas.  The ampules were then irradiated to 
sterilize the contents.  Additional details on sample preparation, methods, and sterilization process are provided in 
references 3 and 4. 
 
REFERENCE VALUES 
 
Reference values are assigned for the homogeneity of the finalized ampoule sets based on multiple measurements.  
Reference values are given for two ratios of peak features measurable using Raman scattering, and for the ratio of the 
optical absorbance measured at two different wavelengths in the ultraviolet and visible ranges of light.  The uncertainty 
in the reference values, calculated according to the method described in the ISO/JCGM Guide [5], is expressed as an 
expanded uncertainty, U.  The expanded uncertainty is calculated as U = kuc, where uc is intended to represent the 
standard  deviation.    The  coverage  factor (k)  is  determined  from  the  Student's  t-distribution  corresponding  to  the 
appropriate associated degrees of freedom and approximately 95 % confidence for SWCNT sample. 
 
UV-Vis Absorbance Spectroscopy:  The ratio of the absorbance values at two wavelengths, 571 nm and 785 nm, were 
using  a  one
measured  using  an  UV-Vis-near  infrared (UV-Vis-NIR)  spectrophotometer  in  transmission  mode  using  a  one 
millimeter quartz cuvette.  The addition of an integrating sphere detector was not used to complete these measurements 
and is not required for use with this material.  The absorbance of the surfactant solution and cuvette were measured 
using the Blank and subtracted from the SWCNT dispersion absorbance before the ratio was calculated.

Raman Scattering Ratio:  The Raman scattering measurements were done using a 514.5 nm Ar+ laser with a spot size 
tio  of  two  distinct  Raman  scattering  features  of 
roughly 100 μm in diameter.  At this excitation  wavelength, the ratio of two distinct Raman scattering features of 
graphitic  carbon,  the  G-band  (located  at  approximately  1587 cm–1)  and  the  D-band  (located  at  approximately 
1320 cm-1), is considered indicative of the fraction of defects in the graphitic carbon content, including nanotubes.  
The ratio of the G-band and an additional peak feature, the G′-band (located at approximately 2625 cm–1), is indicative 
of the SWCNT carbon purity [3]. 
 
The homogeneity of RM 8281 was assessed by using both the G/D ratio and G′/G ratio.  Completely homogenous 
nanotube containing material is expected to exhibit a consistent G/D ratio and G′/G ratio value for the Raman features 
at a given excitation wavelength.  An inhomogeneous sample will exhibit varying ratios of nanotube to graphitic and 
amorphous carbon.  Multiple subsamples were tested to assess homogeneity.  Heterogeneity occurs over a length scale 
smaller than the measured volume of 100 μm3.  Tabulated values for the G/D ratio and G′/G ratio metrics appear in 
Tables 2 and 3, respectively.

ADDITIONAL USER INFORMATION 
 
UV-Vis-NIR Absorbance Spectroscopy:  The wavelength dependent UV-Vis-NIR absorbance spectra are provided in 
Figure 1.  The absorbance spectrum  was recorded in transmission  mode through a 1 mm pathlength cuvette.    The 
addition of an integrating sphere detector was not used to complete these measurements and is not required for use 
with this material.  The absorbance spectrum of the Blank sample was measured independently and subtracted from 
the raw spectra recorded of the nanotube dispersions during data analysis.   
 
The absorbance spectra of each SWCNT population displays multiple peak features identifiable to individual nanotube 
species.  These species are often identified by their chiral vector indices (n,m), which describes the orientation of the 
tubular graphic structure.  Readily observed species include the semiconducting (6,5), (7,5), (7,6), (8,3), (8,4), and 
(9,1) species; the metallic (6,6) and (7,4) nanotubes are also clearly observed.  Other nanotube species may be present 
in the samples but are not readily identified from the absorbance measurement due to their low concentration levels, 
or due to overlapping absorbance features.

Figure 2.    Raman  scattering  spectra  for  RM 8281  length  populations  with  excitation  at  514.5 nm.    Peak 
features  corresponding  to  different  SWCNT  Raman  features,  including  several  RBM  modes,  D-band, 
G-band, M and iTOLA, and G′ (2D)-bands, are visible in the SWCNT samples.  The panels are: A (Long 
population); B (Medium population); and C (Short population).  The D-band (≈1320 cm–1) increases in size 
relative to the G-band (≈1587 cm–1) comparing from the Long to the Short population spectra.  The relative 
size of the G′-band (≈2625 cm–1) to the G-band changes monotonically across the three samples as well.

Near  Infrared  Fluorescence:    Excitation – emission  contour  plot  intensities  and  a  single-wavelength  excitation 
line - emission line plot were measured for each of the nanotube populations and shown in Figure 3.  Prior to analysis, 
samples were diluted to an absorbance of 0.12 cm−1 at 775 nm with the sodium deoxycholate solution from the Blank 
sample.    The  reported  spectra  are  corrected  for  the  emission  train  wavelength-dependent  sensitivity  and  the 
wavelength-dependent excitation power, but not for the inner-filter effects of absorbance or Rayleigh scattering for 
the  solution  in  the  cuvette.    Observation  of  specific  peak  features  is  an  indication  that  specific  semiconducting 
nanotubes are present in the sample, although the direct correlation between intensity and concentration is not fully 
established.  The technique is not sensitive to metallic nanotubes or heavily chemically functionalized nanotubes. 
 
In  Figure 3,  the  emission  intensity  has  been  corrected  for  the  excitation  intensity  and  emission  side 
wavelength-dependent sensitivity.  Dominant peak features are emission from the (6,5), (7,5), and (8,3) chiralities.  
The  (6,4),  (7,6),  (8,4),  (9,1),  (9,2),  (9,4),  (10,2)  and  (8,6)  are  also  present  in  sufficient  quantity  to  be  detected, 
particularly  in  the  Long  population.    Other  chiralities  are  likely  present,  but  in  quantities  too  small  to  display 
fluorescence on this intensity scale (the intensity is normalized by the maximum of the (6,5) emission peak divided 
by 10).  As a reference, empirical excitation – emission peak locations for different SWCNT structures as assigned in 
reference 6 are noted by white dots.  The NIR fluorescence measurement technique is only sensitive to semiconducting 
nanotube chiralities.

Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM):  Images of the contour lengths of RM 8281 populations were acquired using AFM 
and are shown in Figure 4.  Prior to measurement, aliquots of each of the SWCNT length populations were washed 
with  fresh  10 g/L  sodium  deoxycholate  solution  using  an  ultrafiltration  membrane  (30 000 Da  molecular  weight 
cutoff) in a stirred ultrafiltration cell to achieve a volumetric dilution of the irradiated surfactant solution of greater 
than 100 fold. 
 
This step was necessary, because an artifact of the irradiation used for sterilization of the SWCNT populations is the 
formation of small particles in the surfactant solution that prevent the deposition of the SWCNTs on a surface for 
AFM measurement.  In this surfactant exchange, the small particles pass through the membrane and are removed, but 
the nanotubes of all lengths are too large to pass through the pores and are retained for measurement.  Figure 4 contains 
images of each of the populations.

Transmission  Electron  Microscopy (TEM):    Figure 6  contains  images  of  the  TEM  micrograph  of  SWCNTs  from 
aliquots  of  RM 8281  deposited  onto  a  TEM  grid.    Sample  aliquots  were  prepared  by  diluting  each  of  the  three 
RM 8281  sample  ampoules  with  ultrapure  water,  a  1:10 dilution.    From  each  dilution,  approximately  15 µL  was 
deposited onto a copper grid and allowed to dry.  A single-tilt sample holder was used for TEM observation.  Images 
were taken on a TEM operated at 200 kV under low-dose operating conditions.  Low dose means that the electron 
flux onto the samples was restricted with a small condenser aperture (typically 40 µm in diameter) and defocusing the 
illumination to the minimum that would allow an image to be captured with a 2 s exposure.  All images were captured 
with a one megapixel CCD camera located below the viewing chamber.  The SWCNT samples comprise primarily, 
on  a  dry-mass  basis,  the  dispersing  surfactant.    Nanotubes  are  visible  in  each  of  the  images  mixed  with  the  dried 
surfactant. 
 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

Figure 6.  Micrographs of SWCNTs from aliquots of RM 8281 deposited onto a TEM grid.  The SWCNT 
sample  panels  are:    A (Long  population);  B (Medium  population);  and  C (Short  population).    Bundled 
nanotubes are visible along with the surfactant in each image.  On an individual basis, the nanotubes visible 
in the image are approximately 0.7 nm in diameter, consistent  with the spectroscopic results.  Significant 
quantities of surfactant are visible in the images due to the large quantity of surfactant in the liquid dispersions 
on a dry-mass basis.
