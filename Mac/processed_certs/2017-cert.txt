Multi-Angle White Reflectance Standard 
 
Serial No.:   
 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended for use in calibrating the reflectance factor scale of multi-angle 
reflectance instruments for an illumina tion angle of 45° and aspecular angl es of 15°, 25°, 45°, 75°, and 110° at 
visible wavelengths.  SRM 2017 is a polished white Russian opal glass with a diameter of 44 mm, mounted in a 
Delrin1 holder with a diameter of 57 mm and a thickness of 13 mm.  A mark in the holder indicates the direction of 
illumination.  The serial number is located on the back of the holder. 
 
Certified Values of Reflectance Factor:   This SRM was individually calibrated using the NIST High Accuracy 
Reference Reflectometer [1,2], which  determines bi-directional spectral refl ectance with an absolute technique.  
Figure 1 shows typical reflectance factors as a function of wavelength for the reported aspecular geometries.  The 
certified reflectance factor is given in Table 1 for wavelengths from 360 nm to 780 nm at an increment of 10 nm.  
This reflectance factor is valid for  unpolarized light at an illumination angl e of 45º from the sample normal and 
aspecular angles of 15°, 25°, 45°, 75°, and 110°, as shown in Figure 2, over the central 20 mm diameter of the 
sample.  The uncertainty contributions and expanded uncertainty for the certified reflectance factors are given in 
Table 2. 
 
Expiration of Certification:   The certification of this SRM is deemed to be valid, within the uncertainties 
specified, for a period of five years from the date of certification specified in Table 1, provided the sample has been 
handled in accordance with the handling instructions given in this certifi cate.  This SRM may be recertified if the 
sample surface has not been altered, contaminated, 
contingent upon inspection by NIST.  For acceptance inspection and recertification information, contact M.E. Nadal 
of the NIST Optical Technology Division by phone (301) 975-4632; fax (301) 869-5700; or email 
maria.nadal@nist.gov. 
 
Handling Instructions: When not in use, the sample should be properly stored in its original container.  Improper 
handling will adversely affect the condition of the front su rface.  Lint-free gloves (nylon  or latex) should be used 
when handling the sample to prevent  fingerprints on the surface.  Gently us e a clean air bulb to remove dust from 
the front surface.  The polished surface 
of the sample is very stable.  Ho wever, care should be exercised while 
cleaning and handling the sample to avoid scratching the polished surface. 
 
The overall direction and coordination leading to certifica tion was provided by G.T. Fraser of the NIST Optical 
Technology Division.  The initial research , development, and technical measurements leading to certification of this 
SRM were performed in the NIST Optical Technology Division by M.E. Nadal and E.A. Early. 
 
Statistical consultation was provided by A.I. Aviles of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division. 
 
The support aspects involved in the preparation, certifica tion, and issuance of this SRM were coordinated through 
the NIST Standard Reference Materials Group by J.W.L. Thomas.

Source of Material:  The samples were produced by the Hemmendinger Color Laboratory, Princeton, NJ. 
 
Determination of Reflectance Factor:   The bi-directional spectral reflectan ce measurements were made using the 
NIST High Accuracy Reference Reflectom eter [1,2].  The sample was placed  in a mount on the sample goniometer 
so that its front surface was on the axis  of rotation.  The collimated illuminati on beam, with less than 1º divergence, 
a 14.5 nm spectral bandwidth, and a diameter of 14 mm was centered on the front of the sample.  The orientation of 
the mount was adjusted so that, at a  goniometer angle of 0º, the illumination b eam was retroreflected.  This aligned 
the normal of the sample parallel to the illumination axis.  The geometry is denoted by 
θi/θv  with respect to the 
normal of the sample so that, fo r example, the specular condition  θi  = 45°,  θv = –45° is represented by 45°/–45°.  
The aspecular angle is the viewing angle measured from th e specular angle toward the sample normal.  Radiant flux 
was collected and measured using a r eceiver mounted on an arm of the goniometer.  The distance from the center of 
the illuminated area to the cente r of the limiting aperture of  the collector optics was 670.7 mm.  The diameter of the 
limiting aperture was 31.85 mm.  The sources of radiant flux into the monochromator were a xenon arc lamp for 
wavelengths less than 390 nm and a quartz-tungsten-hal
ogen incandescent lamp for longer wavelengths.  The 
optical detector was a silicon photodiode.  During the measurements, the am bient temperature was 20 ºC ± 3 ºC and 
the relative humidity was 40 % ± 10 %. 
 
The bi-directional spectral reflectance was measured at wavelengths from 360 nm to 780 nm at a 10 nm increment 
for polarizations of the illumination beam both parallel and perpendicular to the plane of illumination
, an 
illumination angle of 45°, and aspecular  angles of 15°, 25°, 45°, 75°, and 110°.   As shown in Figure 2, the sample 
was positioned so that the projection of the illumination 
Delrin holder.  For each wavelength a nd polarization, the following measurement sequence was followed.  With the 
sample translated out of the illumination beam, a signal pr oportional to the incident ra diant flux was measured by 
the receiver, termed the incident signa l.  The reflected radiant flux was measured by centering the sample in the 
illumination beam and rotating it with the goniometer to 
rotated so that the viewing angle was in the desired aspecular direction, and a signal proportional to the reflected 
  The sequence was completed by again measuring the 
radiant flux was measured, termed the reflected signal.
incident signal.  Also, after each signal reading, a shutter was closed on th e monochromator and a dark signal was 
measured. 
 
For each wavelength and polarization, th e reflectance factor was calculated by  subtracting the dark signals from the 
incident and reflected signals to yield net signals, dividing  the net reflected signal by the  average of the net incident 
signals and the projected solid angle of the limiting aperture, and multiplying by the constant 
π.  The reflectance 
factor for unpolarized incident light was calculated by averaging the reflectance factors of both polarizations. 
 
Discussion of Uncertainties:  Uncertainties were calculated according to  the procedures outlined in Reference [3]. 
Type A uncertainty components due to  random effects include source stability a nd detector noise.  The uncertainty 
contribution caused by these effects was  evaluated from the standard deviation  of repeat measurements (three scans 
with ten measurements each) of each sample. 
 
Type B uncertainty components due to systematic effects include those that depend on the scattering properties of 
the sample (wavelength, uniformity, illumination, and viewing angle) and those that are independent of the 
(solid angle and viewing angle).  The uncertainty contribution for the solid angle includes the standard uncertainty 
in the distance from the illuminated area to the center of the limiting aperture of the collector optics and the standard 
standard uncertainties in distance, diameter, wavelength, 
uncertainty in the diameter of the limiting aperture.  The 
and angles are given in Reference [2].  The uncerta
derivative of the reflectance factor.  The uncertainty contributions for illumination and viewing angles were 
evaluated from reflectance factors measur ed at angles differing from the nominal angles by 0.1º.  The uncertainty 
contribution for uniformity was evaluated from reflectance factors measured at 5 mm displacements, both horizontal 
and vertical, from the center of the sa mple.  All uncertainty components were  assumed to have normal probability 
distributions. 
 
The sources of uncertainty and uncertainty contributions ar e given in Table 2, categorized by effect and dependence 
on sample.  The expanded uncertainty in reflectance factor is obtained from the root-sum-square of the uncertainty 
contributions multiplied by a coverage factor k = 2.
