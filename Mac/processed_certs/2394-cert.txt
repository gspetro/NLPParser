Standard Reference Material® 2394



Heteroplasmic Mitochondrial DNA Mutation Detection Standard



This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is composed of human mitochondrial DNA mixtures which simulate different levels of heteroplasmy.  SRM 2394 is intended to provide quality control benchmarks for forensic, medical, and DNA scientists to assess the detection sensitivity of low-frequency mutations, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in either mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or in pooled nuclear DNA samples, or heteroplasmic sites in mtDNA.  A unit of SRM 2394 consists of a single protective plastic box containing ten tubes: one tube containing the 100 % (by mass) polymorphic DNA, one tube containing the 100 % (by mass) CRS() DNA, and eight tubes containing different mass percentages of the polymorphic/CRS mtDNA mixtures.  Each tube contains 25 μL of DNA at a concentration of 8 ng/μL in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5.



The DNA mixtures are constructed from the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products from two different cell culture lines (CHR and GM09947A) that differ by one base pair (bp) at nucleotide position (np) 6371 in the 285 bp amplified region.  The cell line (CHR) designated polymorphic has a T at np 6371 and the cell line (GM09947A) containing the CRS sequence has a C at that site.



Certified Values:  Table 1 contains the certified mass fraction values of polymorphic/CRS mtDNA mixtures (mass % polymorphic levels are 1 %, 2.5 %, 5 %, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, and 50 %).  The uncertainty values calculated on the 50/50 mixture are reported in section, “Uncertainty Analysis”.  Table 2 contains the certified sequence information of the 285 bp amplicon from the two cell lines (CHR and GM09947A) and shows the one bp difference at np 6371.  The entire 16,569 bp of mtDNA from both CHR and GM09947A was sequenced for SRM 2392, and that sequence is given in reference 1, the Certificate of Analysis for SRM 2392 [2], and in NIST SP260-155 [3].  



Reference Values:  Table 3 contains the reference sequences of the forward and reverse primers used in the PCR amplifications of the 285 bp DNAs that were blended to construct these mixtures.



Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 2394 is valid, within the measurement uncertainties specified, until 31 July 2019 provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given in this certificate (see “Instructions for Use”).  This certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, or modified.



Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive technical changes occur that affect the certification before the expiration of this certificate, NIST will notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification.



Overall direction and coordination of the technical measurements leading to the certification were performed by D.K. Hancock and B.C. Levin formerly of the NIST Biotechnology Division.



The analytical determination, technical measurements, and analysis of data for the certification of this SRM were performed by D.K. Hancock, L.A. Tully, and B.C. Levin formerly of the NIST Biotechnology Division.  Complete details can be found in reference 4.

Support aspects involved in the issuance of this SRM were coordinated through the NIST Office of Reference Materials.



Permissions:  The research using CHR and GM09947A DNA was deemed exempt by the NIST Institutional Review Board and the Director of the Chemical Science and Technology Laboratory.  This work fits into the exemption category described in 15 CFR 27.101(b)(4) which exempts:  “Research, involving the collection or study of existing data, documents, pathological specimens, or diagnostic specimens, if, these sources are publicly available or if the information is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that subjects cannot be identified, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects.”



INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE AND USE



Storage:  Store frozen at a temperature of –20 °C.  Do not store in a self-defrosting freezer because the periodic cycling of temperatures may shorten the shelflife of this SRM.



Use:  Minimize repeated freezing and thawing of these materials as this might shorten the shelf-life of the SRM.  If it is necessary to perform many repeated analyses, the SRM may be thawed and the tube contents aliquoted into sterile tubes that can be kept frozen until use.  Thawing can be conducted at refrigerator temperatures, room temperature, or at 37 °C.  After thawing, briefly centrifuge the sample tube to spin down any condensate present in the tube cap, and gently mix to obtain a homogeneous solution.  The tube manufacturer cautions that the sample tube caps should be tightened snugly, but not over-tightened.  DNA concentrations given are nominal values and are NOT intended for use as concentration standards; only the mass concentration ratios are certified.



SOURCE AND ANALYSIS()



Source of Material:  CHR DNA was prepared in the NIST DNA Technologies Group, Biotechnology Division.  GM09947A DNA was prepared by Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD).  (Note:  The current vendor of GM09947A is Marligen Biosciences Inc., Ijamsville, MD.)  The 285 bp amplicons from CHR and GM09947A and their mixtures were prepared by the DNA Technologies Group, formerly of the NIST Biotechnology Division.



NIST Analysis:  PCR was used to amplify the 285 bp area of the mtDNA from cell lines CHR and GM09947A using the primer set shown in Table 3.  The PCR products were sequenced with an ABI PRISM® 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA).  Multiple techniques were examined to identify an optimal way to determine the relative mass concentration of each amplicon. The techniques examined included ultraviolet (UV) absorbance at 254 nm, fluorescence analysis using a number of DNA dyes on different platforms, peptide nucleic acid (PNA), Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE), Denaturing High Performance Liquid Chromatography and oligonucleotide hybridization analysis using the Luminex 100 system.  Once the relative mass concentrations of the PCR products were determined, the mixtures were prepared.

(a) Ten color-coded components are included in each kit.  These components are labeled with an “A” designating DNA from cell line CHR (polymorphic) and “B” designating DNA from GM09947A (CRS).  Components 1 and 2 contain equal mass concentrations of CHR and GM09947A, respectively.  The mixtures (components 3 through 10) were prepared by blending appropriate masses of components 1 and 2.





						Uncertainty Analysis:  The certified values listed in Table 1 correspond to means of the mass concentrations ratios.  Each certified DNA ratio is assigned a relative expanded uncertainty about the mean, with coverage factor k = 2 (95 % confidence level), of 1.7 %, calculated by combining a between-method variance with a pooled within-method variance [7,8] following the ISO/JCGM Guide [9] and reference 10.  Since all mixtures are prepared from the same stock solutions that were adjusted to have equal (1:1) mass concentrations, and no sequential dilutions were performed, the uncertainty reported on the certified DNA ratios is on the actual quotients of the 50/50 mixture of CHR and GM09947A DNA.  A consensus mean, across all measured conditions, for such a quotient is 1.002.  The 1.7 % relative error (k = 2) associated with the number 1.002 is  0.017.  The measurand is the total mass fraction for each analyte listed in Table 1.  The certified values are metrological traceable to the SI unit of mass.
