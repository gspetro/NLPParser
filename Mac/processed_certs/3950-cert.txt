This Standard Reference Material  (SRM) is intended primarily for  use in  evaluating the accuracy of procedures for 
the determination of the vitamin B6 metabolite pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) in human serum.  It is also intended for 
use in validating working or secondary reference materials.   PLP is the major circulating form of  vitamin B6 and the 
most common direct measure of this vitamin in serum or plasma.  A unit of SRM 3950 consists of two stoppered vials 
of frozen human serum,  one  vial each at two different concentration levels.  Each vial contains 1.0  mL of human 
serum. 
 
The development of SRM  3950  was a   collaboration between the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology (NIST) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS).  Analyses for 
value assignment were performed by NIST and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, GA. 
 
Certified  Concentration  Values:   The certified  concentration  values  for  PLP  are  provided in Table  1.   A NIST 
certified value is a  value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that all
 known or suspected 
sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [1].  The certified concentration values for each level are 
based  on the agreement of results from 
spectrometry (ID LC-MS/MS)  at NIST  [2]  and liquid chromatography/fluorescence 
CDC [3].  All values were combined without weighting.   The certified concentrations apply only to serum thawed to

Information Concentration Values:  Information concentration values are provided  for the vitamin  B6 metabolite 
4-pyridoxic acid   in Table  2.   A NIST   information value is a value that may be of interest to the SRM user, but 
insufficient information is available to assess the uncertain

metrological traceability. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 3950 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
ructions given in this 
until  31 March 2023, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the inst
this 
certificate (see “Instructions for Storage and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, 
11s  damaged,  contaminated, 
or otherwise modified.  
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes occur that affect the certification before the expiration of th
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification.

Analytical measurements were performed by J. Camara, E.L. Kilpatrick, and L.T. Sniegoski of the Chemical Sciences 
Division.   Measurements at CDC were performed by M.
C.M. Pfeiffer. 
 
Certified Concentration Values:    The uncertainty provided with each value is an expanded uncertainty about the
 
mean to cover the measurand with approximately 95  % confidence; it incorporates Type  B uncertainty components 
sults from the methods and their 
related to the analyses, and expresses both the observed difference between the re
respective uncertainties, consistent with the ISO /JCGM  Guide and with its Supplement
 1 [4–6].  The expanded 
uncertainty is calculated as U = kuc, where uc is the combined uncertainty, and k is a coverage factor corresponding to 
approximately 95 % confidence for each analyte [4].  For the certified values shown below, k = 2.  The measurand is 
the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate value listed in Table 1.  Metrological traceability is to the SI derived unit for mass fraction 
(expressed as ng/g), mass concentration (expressed as ng/mL), and amount -of-substance concentration (expressed as 
nmol/L).

INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE AND USE 
 
Storage:  The serum is shipped frozen (on dry ice) and, upon receipt, should be stored frozen until ready for use.  The 
material should be stored at or below  –60 °C.  This SRM should be handled under subdued lighting conditions (i.e., 
yellow light) [8,9]. 
 
Use:   SRM 3950 is provided as frozen  serum that should be allowed to thaw at room temperature  (20 °C to 25  °C) 
ial  should  then 
under subdued light.  After the material is thawed, it should be used immediately.  The contents of the vial should then 
se
be gently mixed prior to removal of a test portion for analysis.  Precauti ons should be taken to expo se serum only 
under subdued lighting conditions. 
 
SOURCE, PREPARATION, AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Source and Preparation:  SRM 3950 was prepared by Aalto Scientific Ltd. (Carlsbad, CA).  Level 1 is an unfortified 
pool of human serum.  In order to achieve the desired level of 
PLP in Level  2, a human serum pool conta ining a 
naturally lower level was fortified with additional PLP. 
 
Analytical Methods:  NIST determined vitamin B6 levels as PLP by ID LC-MS/MS [2].  A labeled internal standard 
(pyridoxal-[2H3] 5'-phosphate) was added to 0.5 g serum and allowed to equilibrate for 30 min.  Serum proteins were 
precipitated by the addition of aqueous trichloroacetic acid 
-MS/MS.   The transitions at  m/z 248.0  →  m/z 149.9  and  
centrifugation, supernatants were analyzed by LC
m/z 251.1 → m/z 153.0 were monitored for the unlabeled and labeled forms of the analyte, respectiv ely.   The CDC 
  determined  the  vitamin B6  vitamers 
precipitated proteins with metaphosphoric acid, filtered the samples, and
pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and 4 -pyridoxic acid by LC with chlorite post
-column derivatization and fluorescence 
detection [3,10].  The B6 vitamers were separated  under isocratic conditions on a C 18 column with a mobile phase 
comprised of aqueous phosphate buffer (with 0.2  % acetonitrile , volume fraction ).  The initial mobile phase was 
comprised of 100 % aqueous buffer, and a linear gradient from 0  % to 30 % methanol was employed after elution of 
the B6 vitamers to facilitate column cleanup between injections. 
 
Homogeneity Assessment:  The homogeneity of  PLP was assessed at NIST using the  method and test portion size 
described above; analysis of variance did not show statis
tically significant   heterogeneity.    All analytes have been 
treated as though they are homogeneously distributed in the material althou gh the homogeneity of the other analytes 
was not assessed.

and Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the purpose.
