Potassium  Fluoride 
(Standard  for  Ion-Selective!  Electrodes) 

KE.  S.  Etz 

This  Standard  Reference  Material,  certified  for  the  activity  of  fluoride  ion  in  solutions  of  this 
salt,  is  made  available  for  the  standardization  of  fluoride  ion-selective  electrodes.  The  material  is  of 
analytical  reagent-grade  purity,  but  should  not  be  considered  entirely  free  of  traces  of  chloride, 
fluosilicates 
and  heavy  metals.  Potentiometric  measurements  on  solutions  of 
this  material 
employing  fluoride  ion-selective  electrodes  in  cells  without  liquid  junction  indicate  this  material to 
be  homogencous  within  the  precision  (+  0.003  pF  unit)  of  the  measured  potential  of  the  fluoride 
ion-selective  electrode.  Chemical  analysis  of  this  material  indicates  a  minimum  assay  of  99.5  percent 
KF  after  drying.

This  material  is  certified  for  the  activity  coefficient  of  fluoride  ion  and  the  related  value  of  pF 
=~log  ap-,  where  ap  -  is 
a  conventional  activity  of  fluoride  ion)  at  25  °C  for  solutions  of  potassium 
fluoride  over  the  range  of  molalities  m  =  0.0001  to  m 
=  2.0.  Certified  values  of  ay-  and  pF(S)  at 
selected  molalities  are  found  in  the  table  on  the  reverse  page.  The  pF(S)  values  given  are  estimated 
to  be  accurate  to  +  0.01  pF  unit.

The  mean  molal  activity  coefficient  of  potassium  fluoride  from  m  =  0.0001  to  m  =  2.0  may  be 

represented  at  25  °C  by  the  equation: 

log  Y= 

13 

+  Bm  +  Cm?

Am! 

1+Bm 

where  m  is  the  molality.  The  numerical  values  of  the  constants  appearing  in  this  expression  are,  at 
25  °C: 

A=  0.5108 
B  =  1.2880 
B|=  2.7843  x  10-2 
C  =  4.6933  x  10°3 
The  overall  direction  and  coordination  of  the  technical  measurements  leading  to  certification 

were  performed  under  the  chairmanship  of  R.  A.  Durst. 

The  technical  and  support  aspects  involved  in  the  preparation,  certification,  and  issuance  of  this 
standard  reference  material  were  coordinated  through  the  Office  of  Standard  Reference  Materials 
by  T.  W.  Mears.

The  equation  relating  the  mean  molal  activity  coefficient  to  molality  may  be  used  to  calculate 
values  of  pF  at  concentrations  other  than  those  appearing  in  the  table.  The  convention  used  here  for 
the  assignment  of  ionic  activities  in  solutions  of  potassium  fluoride  is  based  on  hydration  theory 
and  is  described  by  Robinson,  Duer  and  Bates  [Anal.  Chem.  43,  1862  (1971)].  For  this  particular 
1:1  electrolyte,  the  convention  leads  to’Y  p- 
in  aqueous  solution,  and  values  of  aF-  are 
therefore  obtained  by  the  relation

Preparation  of  Standard  Solutions 

To  prepare  a  1.0  molal  solution,  transfer  57.363  g  of  potassium  fluoride  (weight  in  air)  to  a 
l-liter  volumetric  flask.  Dissolve  and  fill  to  the  mark  with  distilled  water  at  25  °C,  The  distilled 
water  should  have  a  conductivity  no  greater  than  2  x  10°°Q-!.  The  potassium  fluoride  is  hygro- 
scopic  and  should  be  dried  in  two  consecutive  stages;  initially  for  a  period  of  2  hours  at  110  °C, 
followed  by  drying  at  200  +  10  °C  for  an  additional  2  hours.  After  drying,  normal  precautions 
should  be  exercised  to  prevent  pickup  of  moisture,  i.e.,  minimal  exposure  to  humid  conditions  prior 
to  and  during  weighing.

Similarly,  a  0.1  molal  solution  may  be  prepared  by  the  transfer  of  5.786  g  of  potassium  fluoride 
(weight  in  air)  to  a  1-liter  volumetric  flask,  dissolving,  and  diluting  to  the  mark  with  distilled  water 
at  25  °C.  Appropriate  dilution  of  either  standard  solution  should  be  used  to  obtain  standards  in  the 
concentration  range  of  interest  to  the  user. 

After  preparation,  standard  solutions  should  be  transferred  to  non-silicate  storage  containers, 
c.g.,  polyethylene  bottles,  to  avoid  fluosilicate  formation  and  the  resulting  decrease  in  fluoride  ion 
activity. 

Electrode  Calibration 

In  order  to  minimize  residual  liquid  junction  potential  errors  arising  at  the  reference  electrode 
junction,  it  is  recommended  that  reference  standards  be  used  at  concentrations  similar  to  those  of 
the  samples.  Also,  the  use  of  a  bracketing  technique,  whereby  two  standard  solutions  bracket  the 
concentration  range  of  the  samples,  will  increase  the  reliability  of  the  measurements  by  minimizing 
errors  due  to  non-Nernstian  clectrode  response.
