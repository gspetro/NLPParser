elements 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended primarily for validation of methods for determining elements 
in  wheat  flour  and  similar  materials.    This  SRM  can  also  be  used  for  quality  assurance  when  assigning  values  to 
in-house  reference  materials.    A  unit  of  SRM 1567b  consists  of  a  single  bottle  containing  approximately  50 g  of 
material sealed inside an aluminized pouch. 
 
mass  fraction 
Certified  Mass  Fraction  Values:    The  certified  mass  fraction  values  of  selected  elements  in  SRM 1567b  are 
provided in Table 1.  A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in 
that all known or suspected sources of bias have been investigated or taken into account [1].  Values are reported on 
a dry-mass basis in mass fraction units [2]. 
 
Reference Mass Fraction Values:  Reference mass fraction values are provided for additional elements (Table 2).  
A NIST reference  value is a  noncertified value that is the  best estimate of the true  value based on available data; 
however,  the  value  does  not  meet  the  NIST  criteria  for  certification  and  is  provided  with  associated  uncertainties 
that may reflect only measurement reproducibility, may not include all sources of uncertainty, or may reflect a lack 
of sufficient statistical agreement among multiple analytical methods [1].  Values are reported on a dry-mass basis in 
mass fraction units [2]. 
 
Information  Mass  Fraction  Values:    Information  mass  fraction  values  for  several  elements  determined  using  a 
single method at NIST are provided in Table 3.  A NIST information value is a value that may be of interest to the 
SRM  user,  but  insufficient  information  is  available  to  assess  the  uncertainty  associated  with  the  value  or  only  a 
limited  number  of  analyses  were  performed.    Values  are  reported  on  a  dry-mass  basis  in  mass  fraction  units [2].  
Information values cannot be used to establish metrological traceability. 
 
Expiration  of  Certification:    The  certification  of  SRM 1567b  is  valid,  within  the  measurement  uncertainty 
specified,  until  01 November 2023,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  and  stored  in  accordance  with  the  instructions 
given  in  this  certificate  (see  “Instructions  for  Storage  and  Use”).    The  certification  is  nullified  if  the  SRM  is 
damaged, contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance  of  SRM  Certification:    NIST  will  monitor  this  SRM  over  the  period  of  its  certification.    If 
substantive  technical changes occur that affect the certification before the expiration of this certificate, NIST  will 
notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification.

USERS 
NOTICE AND WARNING TO USERS 
 
SRM 1567b IS INTENDED FOR LABORATORY USE ONLY, NOT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE AND USE 
 
Storage:    The  SRM  should  be  stored  at  controlled  room  temperature  (20 °C to 25 °C)  in  the  original  unopened 
bottle.  For elemental analyses, the bottle can be re-capped, stored at controlled room temperature (20 °C to 25 °C),  
and test portions removed and analyzed until the material reaches its expiration date. 
 
Use:  Before use, the contents of the bottle should be mixed thoroughly.  Allow the contents to settle for one minute 
prior to opening to minimize the loss of fine particles.  To relate analytical determinations to the certified values in 
this Certificate of Analysis, the test portion mass indicated in the description of the NIST analyses for each group of 
analytes below should be used.  Results obtained in analyses should include their own estimates of uncertainty and 
can  be  compared  to  the  certified  values  using  procedures  described  in  reference [3].    A  minimum  sample  mass 
related to the NIST analytical determination is described in the “Source, Preparation, and Analysis” section. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR DRYING 
 
Residual  moisture  content  should  be  determined  on  a  separate  sample  for  conversion  of  analytical  results  to  a 
dry-mass basis.  The recommended drying methods are (1) freeze drying at 25 °C for 24 h; (2) oven drying at 90 °C 
for 2 h; or (3) desiccator drying over magnesium perchlorate for 28 d.  The observed moisture content ranges from 
6.6 % to 8.5 % (mass fraction). 
 
SOURCE, PREPARATION, AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
2013  to  produce
Source and Preparation:  Material existing from production of SRM 1567a was reprocessed in 2013 to produce 
SRM 1567b.  SRM 1567b is wheat flour milled from a blend of hard red spring  wheat and hard red winter  wheat 
grown primarily in South Dakota.  The flour was taken from the mill packer during the middle of a run to obtain a 
homogeneous  material.    The  flour  has  been  bleached  and  brominated  in  accordance  with  standard  treatment  for 
commercial  bakery  use  before  1991.    The  original  wheat  flour  was  ground  to  pass  through  a  425 μm  (40 mesh) 
sieve, blended, and bottled at NIST.  The original bottled material was then irradiated to an absorbed dose of 25 kGy 
of 60Co by Neutron Products, Inc. (Dickerson, MD).  The reprocessed material was dried for 24 h at 101 °C and then 
double-blended using a ceramic-lined cone blender for 30 min.  Fifty grams of material were placed in 4 oz amber 
bottles.  The bottles were capped and individually sealed in aluminized bags. 
 
Analytical Approach for Determination of Elements:  Value assignment of the mass fractions of the elements in 
SRM 1567b was based on the combination of measurements from two different analytical methods at NIST where 
available.  Where certified values from SRM 1567a were considered scientifically valid, the combined estimator is 
the  mean  of  two  methods,  one  from  the  new  data  and  the  other  being  from  the  certified  value  from  SRM 1567a.  
NIST  provided  measurements  by  using  inductively  coupled  plasma  optical  emission  spectrometry (ICP-OES), 
inductively  coupled  plasma  mass  spectrometry (ICP-MS),  isotope  dilution  inductively  coupled  plasma  mass 
spectrometry (ID-ICP-MS),  instrumental  neutron  activation  analysis (INAA),  sector  field  inductively  coupled 
plasma mass spectrometry (SF-ICP-MS), and wavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (WDXRF). 
 
NIST Analyses for Al, As, Cu, Mo, Rb, Se, and Na Using ICP-OES, SF-ICP-MS, and/or ICP-MS:  Aluminum, 
arsenic,  copper,  molybdenum,  rubidium,  selenium,  and  sodium  were  measured  by  ICP-OES,  SF-ICP-MS,  or 
ICP-MS using duplicate 0.5 g test portions taken from each of eight bottles of SRM 1567b.  Samples were digested 
in nitric acid using a microwave sample preparation system.  Quantification was based on the method of standard 
additions.   
 
NIST Analyses for Pb Using Isotope Dilution ICP-MS:  Lead was measured by ID-ICP-MS using duplicate 1.0 g 
test portions taken from each of six bottles of SRM 1567b.  Samples  were spiked with isotopically enriched  206Pb 
and were digested in nitric acid using a microwave sample preparation system.  Sample digests were evaporated to 
near dryness and a portion was reconstituted in dilute nitric acid for lead analysis. 
 

                                                           

(1)  Certain  commercial  equipment,  instruments  or  materials  are  identified  in  this  certificate  to  adequately  specify  the 
experimental  procedure.    Such  identification  does  not  imply  recommendation  or  endorsement  by  the  National  Institute  of 
Standards and Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the 
purpose.

NIST  Analyses  for  Al,  Br,  Ca,  Cl,  Fe,  Mg,  Mn,  P,  K,  Rb,  S,  and  Zn  Using  WDXRF:    Aluminum,  bromine, 
calcium, chlorine, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, potassium, rubidium, sulfur, and zinc were measured 
by  WDXRF  using  duplicate  2.5 g  test  portions  taken  from  each  of  24 bottles  of  SRM 1567b.    Briquettes  were 
prepared for each sample.  The K-L2,3 characteristic X-ray lines of all elements were used for quantification. 
 
NIST  Analyses  for  Br,  K,  Mn,  and  Na  Using  INAA:    Bromine,  manganese,  potassium,  and  sodium  were 
measured by INAA using duplicate 0.25 g test portions taken from each of six bottles of SRM 1567b.  Powders were 
pressed into cylindrical pellets and irradiated in the pneumatic tube RT-2 of the NIST reactor at a reactor power of 
20 MW.  Samples, standards, and controls were packaged individually in clean polyethylene bags for analysis using 
gamma-ray spectroscopy.  The count was done after several hours decay at a sample-to-detector distance of 5 cm for 
30 min counting time. 
 
Homogeneity  Assessment:    The  homogeneity  of  elements  was  assessed  at  NIST  from  methods  and  test  portion 
sizes  described  above.    For  the  elements  measured  from  bottles  of  SRM 1567b,  analyses  of  variance  with  5 % 
pattern  of
significance  level  did  not  show  statistically  significant  heterogeneity.    The  data  for  Pb  indicated  a  pattern  of 
heterogeneity so the uncertainty for Pb incorporates an uncertainty component for possible heterogeneity. 
 
Value Assignment:  For elements for which the certified values for SRM 1567a remained valid, new NIST data and 
these values were combined.  The combined estimator is the mean of the new NIST data and the original certified 
value for SRM 1567a.  For elements for which the certified values for SRM 1567a were no longer valid, the values 
are the  mean  from the combination of the  means of results from analyses by NIST.    In the case of cadmium, the 
certified value  for SRM 1567a  was  used  for SRM 1567b.  Original values for SRM 1567a  were determined using 
the  following  methods:  graphite  furnace  atomic  absorption  spectrometry  (GFAAS),  flame  atomic  absorption 
spectrometry (FAAS), 
absorption 
spectrometry (FES), 
spectrometry (HydAAS),  inductively  coupled  plasma  optical  emission  spectrometry (ICP-OES),  direct-current 
plasma  atomic  emission  spectrometry (DCP-AES)  thermal  ionization  mass  spectrometry (TIMS),    isotope  dilution 
inductively  coupled  plasma  mass  spectrometry (ID-ICP-MS),  instrumental  neutron  activation  analysis (INAA), 
radiochemical neutron activation analysis (RNAA), and spectrophotometry (SPECTRO). 
 
Certified Mass Fraction Values for Selected Elements:  Each certified mass fraction value is the mean from the 
combination of the  means of  results from analyses by NIST or the combination of  mean results from analyses by 
NIST and the certificate value from SRM 1567a treated as a method estimate, where appropriate.  The uncertainty 
provided  with  each  value  is  an  expanded  uncertainty  about  the  mean  to  cover  the  measurand  with  approximately 
95 % confidence.  The expanded uncertainty is calculated as U = kuc, where uc incorporates the observed difference 
between the results from the methods and their respective uncertainties and an uncertainty component for moisture 
correction, consistent with the ISO/JCGM Guide, and k is a coverage factor corresponding to an approximately 95 % 
level of confidence [4–6].  Since two or more methods were used for each analyte, the measurand is the total mass 
fraction  for  each  analyte  listed.    The  certified  values  are  metrologically  traceable  to  the  SI  unit  of  milligram  per 
kilogram on a dry-mass basis.

Reference Mass Fraction Values for Selected Elements:  Each reference mass fraction value is the mean result of 
a NIST analysis using a single method or the mean from the combination of the mean of results from analyses by 
NIST.    The  uncertainty  provided  is  an  expanded  uncertainty  about  the  mean  to  cover  the  measurand  with 
approximately  95 %  confidence.    The  expanded  uncertainty  is  calculated  as  U = kuc,  where  uc  represents  the 
combined  uncertainty,  incorporating  an  uncertainty  component  for  moisture  correction,  consistent  with  the 
ISO/JCGM  Guide,  and  k  is  a  coverage  factor  corresponding  to  an  approximately  95 %  level  of  confidence [4,5].  
Since  one  or  more  methods  were  used  for  each  analyte,  the  measurand  is  the  total  mass  fraction  for  each  analyte 
listed.    The  reference  values  are  metrologically  traceable  to  the  SI  unit  of  milligram  per  kilogram  on  a  dry-mass 
basis.
