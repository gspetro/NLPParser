Lead-Silica  Glass  for  dc  Volume  Resistivity 

M.  J.  Cellarosi 

This  Standard  Reference  Material  is  in  the  form  of  a  block  of  fine  annealed  lead-silica  glass  approximately  5cm 
square  by  2.5  cm  thick  (about  0.2  kg)  from  which  several  specimens  can  be  cut. 
It  is  certified  and  designed  to 
check  test  methods  and  to  calibrate  equipment  for  determination  of  the  dc  volume  resistivity  of  glass  in  accord- 
ance  with  ASTM  C  657-72(1). 

. 

Using  vacuum-evaporated  gold  electrodes  and  a  dc  voltage  of  100  V,  the  volume  resistivity  is:

The  indicated  uncertainties  are  the  95  percent  tolerance  limits  for  coverage  of  at  least  95  percent  of  these 
specimens  (see  NBS  Mono  148,  pp.  13-14).  In  brief,  if  all  specimens  were  measured,  95  percent  of  the  measured 
values  would  fall  within  the  indicated  tolerance  limits  95  percent  of  the  time.  Included  in  this  uncertainty  are 
possible  specimen  inhomogeneities,  preparation  of  specimens,  and  measurement  errors. 

The  dependence  of  the  resistivity,  p,  on  temperature,  t,  within  the  range  200  °C  to  375  °C  can  be  expressed  as 

7139 
logiop  =  t+  273.15  —  2.577. 

The  technical  and  support  aspects  involved  in  the  preparation,  certification,  and  issuance  of  this  Standard 
Reference  Material  were  coordinated  through  the  Office  of  Standard  Reference  Materials  by  R.  K.  Kirby.

SUPPLEMENTARY  INFORMATION 

  

Direction  and  coordination  of  the  ASTM  interlaboratory  comparisons  were  given  by  Henry  E.  Hagy,  Chair- 
man,  ASTM  Subcommittee  C-14.04  on  Physical  and  Mechanical  Properties  of  Glass.  The  laboratories  that 
cooperated  in  these  measurements  are: 

Corning  Glass  Works,  Corning,  New  York 
General  Electric  Co.,  Richmond  Hts.,  Ohio 
Motorola  Inc.,  Phoenix,  Arizona 
National  Bureau  of  Standards,  Washington,  D.C. 
Ontario  Research  Foundation,  Mississauga,  Ontario,  Canada 
Owens-Illinois,  Inc.,  Toledo,  Ohio 
PPG  Industries,  Creighton,  Pennsylvania 
Rensselaer  Polytechnic  Institute,  Troy,  New  York 

Statistical  analysis  of  the  data  leading  to  certification  was  performed  by  H. 
Standards.
