Standard  Reference  Materials  1819a 

Sulfur  in  Lubricating  Base  Oil 

This  Standard  Reference  Material  (SRM)  is  intended  for  use  as  an  analytical  standard  in  the  determination  of  tou 
sulfur  in  lubricating  base  oils  or  materials  of  similar  composition,  SRM  1819a  consists  of  five  hibricaling  base  ails 
at  different  sulfur  concentrations,

The  sulfur  contents  in  SRM  1819a  were  certified  using  isotope  dilution  thermal  ionization  mass  spectrometry  (1D- 
TIMS).  The  expanded  uncertainty  of  the  certified  values  was  computed  according  to  the  NIST  uncertainty  policy, 
as  described  in  NIST  Technical  Note  1297  [1],  and  is  at  the  95%  level  of  canfidence. 

Oils

SUPPLEMENTAL  INFORMATION 

The  uncertainty  of  the  certified  value  does  not  réflect  the  expected  precision  of  a  finture  measurement  by  X-ray 
fluorescence  spectrascopy  (modified  ASTM  D  4294-90);  therefore,  a  table  providing  the  expected  precision  of  a 
single  future  measurement  (at  the  95%  confidence  level)  is  given,  Assuming  the  measurement  process  is  under 
comiral,  a  future  measurement  should  fall  within  this  unceriainty  of  the  certified  value.

The  table  below  describes  the  sources  of  uncertaimty  combined  co  determine  the  expanded  uncertainties  of  the 
certified  values. 
The  combined  suuulard  uncertainty  is  the  root  sum  of  squares  of  the  individual  standard 
uncertainties,  and  the  expanded  uncertainty  is  the  product  of  the  combined  standard  uncertaimy  and  a  t-multiplier 
based  on  the  degrees  of  freedom  reported  in  the  table.
