Near Infrared Transmission Wavelength Standard from 10 300 cm-1 to 5 130 cm-1  
 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is a certified transfer standard intended for the verification and calibration 
of the wavenumber/wavelength scale of near infrared spectrometers operating in transmission mode.  SRM 2035 is 
certified  for  the  location  of  the  center  of  gravity  (COG)  of  seven  absorbance  bands  in  the  spectral  range  from 
10 300 cm-1 (971 nm) to 5 130 cm-1 (1949 nm) at six spectral bandwidths from 4 cm-1 to 128 cm-1.  
 
SRM  2035  is  a  glass  filter  consisting  of  a  mole  fraction  of  3.00  %  holmium  oxide  (Ho2O3),  a  mole  fraction  of 
1.30 % samarium  oxide  (Sm2O3),  a  mole  fraction  of  0.68  %  ytterbium  oxide  (Yb2O3),  and  a  mole  fraction  of 
0.47 % neodymium  oxide  (Nd2O3)  in  a  base  glass  containing  lanthanum  oxide  (La2O3).    The  filter  is  25  mm  in 
diameter and 1.5 mm thick in an optical mount.  This combination of the rare earth oxide concentrations and filter 
thickness yields absorption bands between 0.1 and 0.6 absorbance units.   
 
Certification:  The certified band locations for the SRM 2035 absorbance spectrum are given in Tables 1 and 2 of 
this certificate.   
 
Certified Values:  The certified[1] vacuum wavenumber locations for seven bands from 10 300 cm-1 to 5 130 cm-1 
and six spectral bandwidths at 24 °C  ±  1.5 °C are given below in Table 1.  When using these filters to verify the 
wavenumber scale of a spectrometer, the certified values that are most representative of the spectral bandwidth of 
the spectrometer being tested should be used.  The absorbance spectrum of SRM 2035 is illustrated in Figure 1 of 
this certificate.  Also shown in Figure 1 is the single channel air reference spectrum (arbitrary units).  Atmospheric 
water vapor is a significant source of variance for band 3 and the associated peak should be used with caution when 
calibrating commercial spectrometers with SRM 2035. 
 
The certified values for wavelength peak locations for seven bands of SRM 2035 from 971 nm to 1949 nm and six 
spectral bandwidths determined by the COG method at 24 °C  ±  1.5 °C are given in Table 2.  These wavelength 
locations were derived from the constant-wavenumber-resolution FT data.   
 
Reference Values:  The reference values [1] of the wavelength band locations at constant wavelength resolution are 
given  in  Table  3. 
  The  band  locations  were  corroborated  with  measurements  from  the  commercial 
spectrophotometer used in the certification of NIST SRM 1920 Near Infrared Reflectance Wavelength Standard [2]. 
 
Information  Values:    Information  values  [1]  of  the  peak  wavelength  and  wavenumber  positions  of  SRM  2035 
derived using the Bruker maximum-finding method (four-point polynomial fit to the top of the peak) are listed in 
Table 4.  These values may be useful in comparing SRM 2035 peak locations on a spectrometer that lacks a center-
of-gravity peak location algorithm. 
 
Expiration  of  Certification:    The  certification  of  SRM  2035  is  valid,  within  the  measurement  uncertainty 
specified,  until  31  December  2018,  provided  the  SRM  is  handled  in  accordance  with  instructions  given  in  this 
certificate  (see  “Instructions  for  Use”).    The  certification  is  nullified  if  the  SRM  is  damaged,  contaminated,  or 
otherwise modified.  
 
The  overall  direction  and  coordination  of  the  technical  measurements  leading  to  certification  were  performed  by 
S.J. Choquette and G.W. Kramer of the NIST Analytical Chemistry Division.

The production and certification of SRM 2035 were performed by S.J. Choquette and J.C. Travis with the assistance 
of C. Zhu of the NIST Analytical Chemistry Division. 
 
The SRM filters were cut and polished by J. Fuller of the NIST Fabrication Technology Division. 
 
Statistical consultation was provided by J.J. Filliben of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division. 
 
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the NIST Measurement Services 
Division. 
 
Maintenance  of  SRM  Certification:    NIST  will  monitor  this  SRM  over  the  period  of  its  certification.    If 
substantive technical changes occur that affect the certification before the expiration of this certificate, NIST will 
notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
Measurement Conditions:  The certification measurements were made using a Bruker IFS 66 Fourier Transform 
(FT)  spectrophotometer1.    The  NIST  spectrophotometer  was  calibrated  in  vacuum  wavenumber  units  using  NIST 
SRM 2517 Wavelength Reference Absorption Cell-Acetylene and water vapor bands.  Details of the measurements 
and data analysis can be found in reference [7]  
 
Wavenumber  and  Wavelength  Band  Location  Methodology:    The  method  used  to  determine  the  certified 
wavenumber (cm-1) and reference wavelength (nm) band locations of SRM 2035 is the COG technique [3,4,5].  If 
another  technique  is  used,  a  comparison  with  the  certified  values may  not  be valid.  In this certificate, positions 
determined with the COG algorithm are referred to as band locations, whereas those determined by other techniques 
are referred to as peak locations.  Only those values listed in Table 4 are peak locations.  For COG calculations, a 10 
% fraction was used for both wavenumber and wavelength absorption data.  Table 2 lists the certified values for the 
wavelength locations of SRM 2035 determined by the COG method.  These values were derived from the certified 
FT  spectrometer  measurements  by  converting  wavenumber  scale  to  air  wavelength.    Because  resolution  varies 
nonlinearly when converting from the wavenumber to the wavelength scale, the appropriate wavelength bandwidth 
is listed for each band.  Table 3 lists the calculated wavelength band locations at constant wavelength bandwidth.  
These values were determined by interpolating the appropriate data from Table 2.  Because all sources of error and 
bias have not been fully investigated in this procedure, the locations in Table 3 are reference values.   
 
NIST  will  provide,  upon  request,  a  copy  of  the  COG  algorithm  used  for  band  certification  by  contacting 
S.J. Choquette at steven.choquette@nist.gov or fax 301-977-0587. 
 
Certification Uncertainty:  The expanded uncertainty (U) [6]for the peak wavenumber and wavelength values is 
given  in  Tables  1  to  3.    U  is  determined  from  the  root-mean-square  combination  of  component  standard 
uncertainties  (i.e. estimated  standard  deviations)  and  a  coverage  factor  k  =  2  computed  according  to  reference  7.  
The coverage factor defines the interval within which the unknown value of the band wavenumber location can be 
asserted  to  lie  with  a  level  of  confidence  of  approximately  95  %.    Components  of  the  uncertainty  include: 
calibration  of  the  NIST  FT  spectrometer  with  SRM  2517  [7],  COG  location  estimate,  location  shift  due  to 
temperature,  and  water  vapor  interference.    Expanded  uncertainties  for  the  reference  wavelength  values  include 
propagation of errors in the interpolation technique. 

                                                 
 

 

1Certain  commercial  equipment,  instruments  or  materials  are  identified  in  this  certificate  to  adequately  specify  the 
experimental procedure.  Such identification does not imply recommendation or endorsement by the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the purpose.

Temperature  Coefficients:    The  filter  temperature  can  be  a  significant  source  of  variance  of  the  band  location. 
Band  locations  of  the  filter  were  determined  using  the  COG  algorithm  with  a  10  %  fraction  over  a  temperature 
range between 6 °C and 50 °C.  The location of each absorbance band as a function of temperature was determined 
by least squares fit to obtain the fit temperature coefficients given in Table 5.  The uncertainties of the values listed 
in  Tables 1  to  3  include  a  temperature  variation  of  3  °C  uniformly  distributed  around  a  nominal  measurement 
temperature of 24 °C. 
 
Handling  and  Storage:    To  maintain  the  integrity  of  SRM  2035,  the  filter  should  only  be  handled  in  its  optical 
mount.    While  not  in  use,  the  SRM  should  be  stored  in  the  container  provided  or  one  with  similar  or  better 
mechanical protection. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 
 
Carefully  insert  SRM  2035  into  the  sample  beam  of  the  spectrometer  being  tested.  Measurements  under  a  dry 
nitrogen  purge  are  highly  recommended.    If  a  nitrogen  purge  is  not  available,  the  location  of  band  3  may 
significantly  differ  from  the  certified  values.    Acquire  the  absorbance  spectrum,  referenced  to  air,  at  a  nominal 
temperature of 24 °C  ±  1.5 °C.  Compare each measured band location to its certified value listed in Table 1 or 3 
for the spectral bandwidth most representative of the spectrophotometer being used.  Band locations in Table 1 are 
vacuum  wavenumber  values,  while  those  in  Tables  2  and  3  are  air  wavelength  values.  To  convert  between  the 
values in Tables 1 and 2, the appropriate correction for the index of refraction of air must be applied [8].  Taking 
into  account  the  certification  uncertainty  of  each  band  of  SRM  2035,  any  significant  differences  between  the 
measured and certified band locations may then be used to recalibrate the spectrometer wavenumber scale.
