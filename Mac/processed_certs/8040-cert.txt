Report of Investigation 
 
Reference Material 8040 
 
Sodium Oxalate (Na2C2O4) Reductometric Standard 

 
This Reference Material (RM) was prepared to provide material of uniform, high purity for use as a working standard 
for oxidation-reduction reactions.  The material conforms to the American Chemical Society specification for reagent-
grade  material,  but  should  not  be  considered  as  entirely  free  from  impurities  such  as  moisture,  sodium  hydrogen 
oxalate and sodium  hydrogen carbonate.  A unit of RM 8040 consists of one bottle containing 60  g of crystalline 
sodium oxalate. 
 
Reference Mass Fraction Value and Uncertainty:  The reference value below is based on the titration of sodium 
oxalate  against  ceric  ammonium  nitrate,  (NH4)2Ce(NO3)6,  which  had  been  standardized  with  SRM  40h,  Sodium 
Oxalate, Na2C2O4, using a modification of the method described by Smith and Fly [1].  The reductometric assay is 
based on a molecular weight of 133.9985 g/mol [2].  Corrections for the effect of buoyancy of air were applied using 
the  values  of  2.34  g/cm3  and  2.61  g/cm3  for  the  densities  of  sodium  oxalate  [3]  and  ceric  ammonium  nitrate  [1], 
respectively.  The reductometric assay of the sodium oxalate can be used for standardizing potassium permanganate, 
KMnO4, solutions by following the procedure in this report.  A NIST reference value is a noncertified value that is 
the best estimate of the true value; however, the value does not meet NIST criteria for certification and is provided 
with  associated  uncertainties  that  may  reflect  only  measurement  precision  and  may  not  include  all  sources  of 
uncertainty. 
 
The expanded uncertainty of the reference value, U, is calculated as U = kuc(y), where uc(y) is the combined standard 
uncertainty calculated according to the ISO/JCGM Guide [4].  The value of uc(y) is intended to represent the combined 
effect of the uncertainty components associated with the measurement method and material homogeneity.  The value 
of  uc(y)  has  been  multiplied  by  a  coverage  factor  of  k  =  2,  obtained  from  the  Student’s  t-distribution  with  ν  =  ∞ 
effective degrees of freedom, to obtain an expanded uncertainty, U, with an approximate 95 % confidence level.  The 
measurand is the  value based on the  method indicated.  The reference  value is  traceable to the  SI derived unit of 
mass fraction (expresses as percent). 
 

Reductometric Assay (mass fraction): 

99.951 %  ±  0.038 % 

 
Expiration  of  Value  Assignment:    RM  8040  is  valid,  within  the  measurement  uncertainty  specified,  until 
29 October 2020, provided the RM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given in this Report of 
Investigation  (see  “Instructions  for  Storage,  Handling  and  Use”).    This  report  is  nullified  if  the  RM  is  damaged, 
contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of RM:  NIST will monitor this RM over the period of its validity.  If substantive technical changes 
occur that affect the value assignment before the expiration of this report, NIST will notify the purchaser.  Registration 
(see attached sheet) will facilitate notification.

Division.   
 
Statistical consultation was provided by W.F. Guthrie of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division.

for  sodium  oxalate 

NOTICE TO USERS 
 
This  material  conforms  to  the 
Source of Material:  The sodium oxalate was obtained from a commercial company.  This material conforms to the 
specifications of the American Chemical Society for sodium oxalate [5]. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORAGE, HANDLING AND USE 
 
Storage:  This RM is stable when stored in its original container, with the cap tightly closed, in a dry environment, 
and under normal laboratory temperatures. 
 
Drying Instructions:  To remove the small amount of surface moisture (about 0.005 %), dry samples for two hours at 
105 °C. 
 
Directions  for  Use  in  Oxidimetry,  Standardization  of  0.02  mol/L  [0.1  equivalents  (eq)/L]  Potassium 
Permanganate, KMnO4:  Transfer 0.3 g of RM 8040, weighed to the nearest 0.1 mg, to a 600 mL beaker.  Add 250 mL 
of dilute sulfuric acid (1 part concentrated to 20 parts final volume with deionized water) previously boiled for 10 minutes 
to 15 minutes and cooled to room temperature.  Stir until the oxalate has dissolved.  Add 39 mL to 40 mL, measured to 
the nearest 0.02 mL, of 0.02 mol/L KMnO4 at a rate of 25 mL to 35 mL per minute while stirring slowly.  Let stand until 
discard,
the pink color disappears [about 45 seconds; if the pink color should persist because the endpoint has been passed, discard, 
and  begin  again,  adding  less  of  the  KMnO4  solution  (0.3  g  of  sodium  oxalate  requires  approximately  44.8  mL  of 
0.02 mol/L KMnO4)].  Heat to 55 °C to 60 °C and complete the titration by adding KMnO4 solution until a faint pink 
color persists for 30 seconds.  Add the last 0.5 mL to 1 mL dropwise, with particular care to allow the solution to become 
decolorized, before the next drop is introduced. 
 
Determine  the  excess  of  KMnO4  required  to  impart  the  permanent  pink  color  to  the  solution.    This  can  be  done  by 
matching the color by adding KMnO4 solution to the same volume of the specially treated dilute sulfuric acid at 55 °C to 
60 °C.  This correction usually amounts to 0.03 mL to 0.05 mL. 
 
In potentiometric titrations, the correction is negligible if the end point is reached slowly. 
 
For the standardization of more dilute solutions, the same conditions are recommended, except that the initial volume 
and size of sample are proportionally reduced. 
 
In very accurate work, the correction is best obtained iodometrically [6] as follows:  Cool the titrated solution to 25 °C, 
add 0.5 g of KI, 2 mL of starch solution, and titrate the liberated iodine with 0.02 mol/L (0.02 eq/L) thiosulfate.  To obtain 
the ratio of the thiosulfate to the KMnO4 solution, add 1 mL of the 0.02 mol/L KMnO4 to 350 mL of the diluted sulfuric 
acid (1 part concentrated to 20 parts final volume with deionized water), stir, add 0.5 g KI, and titrate with the thiosulfate 
solution, adding starch just before the end point is reached.
