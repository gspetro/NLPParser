Report  of  Inbestigation 

Reference  Material  8441 

Wheat  Hardness 

United  States  Department  of  Agriculture 
Federal  Grain  Inspection  Service 

This  Reference  Material  (RM)  is  intended  primarily  for  use  in  calibrating  instruments  used  for  the  determination  of 
hardness  of  bulk  or  single  kerne]  wheat.  RM  8441  was  prepared  and  analyzed  by  the  Federal  Grain  Inspection 
Service  (FGIS)  program,  Grain  Inspection  Packers  and  Stockyards  Administration  of  the  United  States  Department 
of  Agriculture  (USDA).  The  USDA  is  the  sole  authority  for  all  of  the  information  provided  in  this  report,  including 
reference  values  and  other  technical  information.  One  unit  of  RM  8441  consists  of  fifty  pouches,  five  pouches  each 
of  five  hard  wheats  and  five  soft  wheats.  Each  pouch  contains  20  g  of  material. 

Sources  and  Preparation  of  Materials:  Ten  separate  lots  of  wheat  (three  pure  varieties  of  hard  red  winter,  two 
pure  varieties  of  hard  red  spring,  two  pure  varieties  of  soft  red  winter,  and  three  pure  varieties  of  soft  white  wheat) 
were  purchased  from  commercial  sources. 
All  lots  were  cleaned  with  a  Carter-Day'  dockage  tester  and  split  into 
15.9  kg  (35  lb)  sublots  using  a  Garnet’  divider.  A  Boerner’  divider  was  then  used  to  further  split  these  sublots  into 
20  g  portions,  which  were  then  packaged  in  barrier  film  aluminized  pouches. 

CAUTION: 
CONSUMPTION. 

This  RM  is  tor  laboratory  use  only; 

IT  IS  NOT  INTENDED  FOR  HUMAN  OR  ANIMAL 

Stability  and  Use:  For  the  intended  use  of  this  RM  the  wheats,  in  unopened  pouches  and  stored  at  2  °C  to  5  °C,  are 
considered  stable  for  five  years  from  the  date  of  shipment  from  NIST.  Each  pouch  should  be  allowed  to  warm  to 
room  temperature  (23  °C  +  2  °C)  immediately  before  use.  The  FGIS  will  monitor  representative  samples  from  each 
of  the  lots  of  wheat  comprising  this  RM  and  if  any  changes  occur  that  invalidate  this  Report  of  Investigation,  NIST 
will  notify  customers. 

RM  8441  was  characterized  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  Agriculture  Federal  Grain  and  Inspection  Service  (FGIS). 
The  cleaning,  dividing,  and  packaging  of  each  wheat  was  done  at  the  FGIS  under  the  direction  of  A.C.  Johnson. 

The  technical  and  support  aspects  involved  in  the  preparation  and  issuance  of  this  Reference  Material  were 
coordinated  through  the  Standard  Reference  Materials  Program  by  D.G.  Friend  and  N.M.  Trahey.

Such 
identification  does  not  imply  a  recommendation  or  endorsement  by  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology,  nor  does  it  imply  that  the

Bulk  and  Single  Kernel  Reference  Values  and  Uncertainties:  RM  8441  was  prepared  as  a  transfer  standard  for 
linking  the  measurements  of  Near-Infrared  Reflectance  (NIR)  instruments  and  Single  Kernel  Characterization 
System  (SKCS)  4100  instruments  to  the  National 
FGIS  wheat  hardness  reference  scale.  The  bulk  hardness  values 
assigned  to  RM  8441  are  the  scores  that  were  obtained  using  two  reference  NIR  instruments  that  had  been  sloped 
and  biased  to  the  Standard  Hardness  Samples  (SHS).  Hardness  scores  were  obtained  from  ten  sets  of  measurements 
that  were  made  on  each  RM  8441  sample  over  a  period  of  five  weeks  (two  sets  of  measurements  per  week).  Each 
set  of  measurements  consisted  of  determining  the  hardness  values  for  five  ground  portions  of  a  sample  in  the  two 
The  bulk  hardness  score  assigned  to  the  RM  8441  unit  is  the  grand  average  of  one  hundred 
NIR  instruments. 
hardness  measurements  made  on  that  unit  (Table  1). 
The  uncertainty  in  measuring  the  bulk  hardness  values  is 
estimated  from  the  standard  deviation  among  the  averages  of  all  measurements  made  in  the  measuring  period.  The 
mean  hardness  scores  listed  in  Table  1,  are  the  values  that  the  user  should  obtain  using  an  NIR  instrument 
standardized  to  RM  8441  using  AACC  Method  39-70  [1],  such  that  the  mean  hardness  value  measured  for  the  five 
hard  RM  wheats  (M,;,  to  M,,;)  is  76.7  and  the  mean  of  the  hardness  measured  for  the  five  soft  RM  wheats  (Mg,  to 
Mg;)  is  30.5. 
On  a  properly  standardized  NIR  instrument,  using  AACC  Method  39-70,  the  bulk  hardness  value 
measured  for  each  wheat  should  be  within  three  times  the  uncertainty  values  (3  x  u,)  listed  in  Table  1.

The  wheat  hardness  scores  listed  in  Table  2  are  the  values  that  the  user  should  obtain  using  a  SKCS  4100  instrument 
that  has  been  sloped  and  biased  to  RM  8441,  following  the  instructions  in  the  SKCS  4100  Operation  Manual  [2], 
such  that  the  mean  of  the  hardness  values  measured  for  the  five  hard  RM  wheats  (M,,,  to  M,,,)  is  72.6  and  the  mean 
of  the  hardness  scores  measured  for  the  five  soft  RM  wheats  (Mg,  to  Mg;)  is  31.2.  On  a  properly  sloped  and  biased 
SKCS  4100  instrument,  the  hardness  value  measured  for  each  RM  should  be  within  three  times  the  uncertainty 
values  (3  x  u,)  listed  in  Table  2.

Appendix  A 

Computation  Procedure  for  the  Standardization 
of  NIR  and  SKCS  4100  Instruments  Using  RM  8441 

The  process  by  which  the  mean  of  the  hardness  values  measured  for  the  five  hard  RM  8441  wheats  is  adjusted  to 
the  fixed  value,  H,,  and  the  mean  of  the  hardness  values  measured  for  the  five  soft  RM  8441  wheats  is  adjusted  to 
the  fixed  value,  S,  is  called  standardization.  For  bulk  hardness  measurements,  H,  and  S,  are  fixed  at  76.7  and 
are  fixed  at  72.6  and  31.2, 
30.05,  respectively. 
respectively. 

For  single  kernel  hardness  measurements,  Hg,  and  S, 

Let  Mu;,  Min,  Mu3,  Mus,  and  My;  be  the  means  of  the  hardness  values  for  two  or  more  hardness  measurements 
performed  on  Hard  1,  Hard  2,  Hard  3,  Hard  4,  and  Hard  5  RM  wheats,  respectively,  and  let  Ms;,  Mgo,  Ms3,  Msza, 
and  M,,;  be  the  means  of  the  hardness  values  for  two  or  more  hardness  measurements  performed  on  Soft  1,  Soft  2, 
Soft  3,  Soft  4,  and  Soft  5  RM  wheats,  respectively. 

then, 

My  =  (My;  +  My  +  My3  +  Mya  +  Mus)  >  5 

and 

Mg  =  (Mg,  +  Mg.  +  Mg;  +  Mg,  +  Mgs)  +  5 

An  NIR  or  SKCS  4100  instrument  is  standardized  to  RM  8441  if  My  =  H,  and  M,  =  Hg. 
If  My  #  Hy  and  Mg  #  He, 
then  the  hardness  values  measured  for  the  RM  using  these  instruments  are  sloped  and  biased  such  that  M,  =  Hy, 

and  Mg  =  Hg. 

The  following  relationship  holds  true  for  Hz,  Ss,  My,  and  Ms: 
H,  =  a  +  (b  x  My)  and  S,  =  a  +  (b  x  Ms), 
where,  a  and  b  are  the  bias  and  slope  factors  used  to  adjust  the  measured  hardness  values  to  the  appropriate  fixed 
values. 

The  slope  factors  can  be  computed  as  follows:  b  =  (Hg  —  Sg) 

+  (My  —  Ms). 

The  bias  factor  can  be  computed  from:  a  =  H,  -  (b  x  Mj)  or  a  =  Sz  -  (D  x  Mg). 

Therefore,  the  standard  hardness  value  (SHV)  for  each  RM  can  be  determined  using  the  following  relationship: 
SHV  =  a  +  (b  x  Old  HV)  where  old  HV  is  the  hardness  measured  for  RM  8441. 

Example:  Suppose  that  the  SKCS  4100  yielded  the  hardness  values  listed  in  Table  Al  for  RM  8441.
