Nitrated Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Methylene Chloride II 
 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is a solution of 16 nitrated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (nitro-PAHs) 
from nitrophenanthrenes to nitrobenzopyrenes in methylene chloride.  This SRM is intended primarily for use in the 
calibration of chromatographic instrumentation used for the determination of nitro-PAHs.  SRM 2265 is part of a 
suite  of  SRMs containing nitro PAHs in various solvents.  A unit of SRM 2265 consists of five 2-mL ampoules, 
each containing approximately 1.2 mL of solution. 
 
Certified  Concentrations  of  Constituents:    The  certified  concentration  values  and  estimated  uncertainties  for 
14 nitro-PAHs,  expressed  as  mass  fractions,  are  given  in  Table  1  with  the  Chemical  Abstract  Service  (CAS) 
Registry  Numbers  [1].  The  certified  concentration  values  are  based  on  results  obtained  from  the  gravimetric 
preparation  of  this  solution  and  from  the  analytical  results  determined  by  using  gas  chromatography.    A  NIST 
certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that all known or suspected 
sources of bias have been investigated or accounted for by NIST [2].  
 
Reference  Concentration  Values:    Reference  values,  also  expressed  as  mass  fractions,  for  two  additional 
nitro-PAHs are provided in Table 2.  The reference values are noncertified values that do not meet NIST criteria 
for  certification  and  are  provided  with  associated  uncertainties  that  may  reflect  only  measurement  precision,  may 
not  include  all  sources  of  uncertainty,  or  may  reflect  a  lack  of  sufficient  statistical  agreement  among  multiple 
methods.   
 
Expiration  of  Certification:    The  certification  of  this  SRM  lot  is  valid  until  31  March  2016,  within  the 
measurement uncertainties specified, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions 
given in this certificate.  However, the certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, contaminated, or modified.  
NIST reserves the right to withdraw, amend, or extend this certification at any time.   
 
Maintenance  of  SRM  Certification:    NIST  will  monitor  representative  solutions  from  this  SRM  lot  over  the 
period  of  its  certification.    If  substantive  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of 
certification, NIST will notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
Partial funding support for the preparation and certification of this Standard Reference Material was provided by the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Research and Development, Human Exposure and Atmospheric 
Science Division, National Exposure Research Laboratory. 
 
The coordination of the technical measurements leading to the certification of this SRM was under the direction of 
M.M. Schantz and L.C. Sander of the NIST Analytical Chemistry Division. 
 
Preparation  and  analytical  measurements  of  the  SRM  were  performed  by  M.M.  Schantz  of  the  NIST  Analytical 
Chemistry Division and M.P. Cronise and C.N. Fales of the Standard Reference Materials Group.

Consultation  on  the  statistical  design  of  the  experimental  work  and  evaluation  of  the  data  were  provided  by 
S.D. Leigh of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division. 
 
The  support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Measurement

NOTICE AND WARNING TO USERS 
 
Handling:  This  material  contains  nitro-PAHs  and  should  be  handled  with  care.    Use  proper  disposal  methods.  
Refer to the corresponding Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for further handling instructions. 
 
Storage:  Sealed ampoules, as received, should be stored in the dark at temperatures between 10 °C and 30 °C. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE   
 
Sample aliquots for analysis should be withdrawn at 20 °C to 25 °C immediately after opening the ampoules and 
should  be  processed  without  delay  for  the  certified  values  in  Table  1  to  be  valid  within  the  stated  uncertainty. 
Because  of  the  volatility  of  methylene  chloride,  certified  values  are not applicable to material stored in ampoules 
that have been opened for more than 4 minutes, even if they are resealed. 
 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS1
 
The  compounds  used  in  the  preparation  of  this  SRM  were  obtained  from  commercial  sources  or  as  Certified 
Reference Materials (CRMs) from the Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM) (formerly BCR 
[Community Bureau of Reference], Geel, Belgium).  The solution was prepared at NIST by weighing and mixing 
the individual compounds and methylene chloride.  The weighed components were added to the methylene chloride 
and mixed overnight.  The total mass of this solution was measured, and the concentrations were calculated from 
this  gravimetric  procedure.    These  gravimetric  concentrations  were  adjusted  for  the  purity  estimation  of  each 
component, which was determined using flame ionization capillary gas chromatography with two stationary phases 
of different polarities and differential scanning calorimetry.  This bulk solution was then chilled to approximately 
−5 °C, and 1.2 mL aliquots were dispensed into 2-mL amber glass ampoules, which were then flame sealed. 
 
Aliquots from nine ampoules (selected using a stratified, random sampling scheme) were analyzed in duplicate by 
using capillary gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection in the negative ion chemical ionization mode 
and  a  non-polar  5 %  phenyl  methylpolysiloxane  phase.    The  internal  standards  added  to  each  sample  for 
quantification  purposes  were  deuterated  nitro-PAHs.    Calibration  solutions  consisting  of  weighed  amounts  of  the 
compounds  (adjusted  for  the  purity  estimation)  and  the  internal  standard  compounds  in  methylene  chloride  were 
chromatographically analyzed to determine analyte response factors.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

                                                           

1Certain commercial equipment, instrumentation, or materials are identified in this certificate to specify adequately the 
ment  by  the  NIST,  nor  does  it  imply  that
experimental procedure.  Such identification does not imply recommendation or endorsement by the NIST, nor does it imply that 
the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the purpose.

(a)  The results are expressed as the certified value ± the expanded uncertainty.  The certified value is the average of the concentrations determined 
by gravimetric and chromatographic measurements.  The expanded 95 % uncertainty uses a coverage factor of 2 and includes both correction 
for  estimated  purity  and  allowance  for  differences  between  the  concentration  determined  by  gravimetric  preparation  and  chromatographic 
measurements [3]. 

(b)  The  concentrations  listed  in  µg/mL  units  were  obtained  by  multiplying  the  certified  values  in  µg/g  by  the  density  of  the  solution  at  20  °C 

(1.326 g/mL).  A concentration change of less than 1% will occur for a 5 °C temperature change.
