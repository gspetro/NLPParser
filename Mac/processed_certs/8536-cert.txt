Report of Investigation 
 
Reference Material 8536 
 
GISP Greenland Ice Sheet Precipitation 
 
(Hydrogen and Oxygen Isotopes in Water) 

 
This Reference Material (RM) is a secondary reference material with known isotope-number ratios for hydrogen (H) and 
oxygen (O) that are intermediate to VSMOW2 (RM 8535a) and SLAP (RM 8537).  It is intended to be a control for 
working standards that have been calibrated to the VSMOW-SLAP (Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water-Standard Light 
Antarctic Precipitation) δ-scales for isotope-number ratios of hydrogen and oxygen. While the values for this RM are 
reference values, its widespread use permits comparability of data from different laboratories.  A reference value is a 
non-certified value that is the best estimate of the true value; however, the value may reflect only the measurement 
precision  and  may  not  include  all  sources  of  uncertainty [1].    The  equivalent  name  for  this  RM,  as  used  by  the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), is GISP.  A unit of RM 8536 
consists of one ampoule containing approximately 20 mL of water.

Reference  Values  for  the  Relative  Difference  in  Isotope-Number  Ratios:    The  differences  in  measured 
isotope-number ratios of stable hydrogen isotopes [N(2H)/N(1H)] and stable oxygen isotopes [N(18O)/N(16O)] are reported 
as δ2H and δ18O values, respectively.  The relative difference in isotope-number ratios for hydrogen and oxygen are 
defined as: 

δ2H = ([N (2H)sample / N (1H)sample] – [N (2H)VSMOW-SLAP / N (1H)VSMOW-SLAP]) / [N (2H)VSMOW-SLAP / N (2H)VSMOW-SLAP] 

δ18O = ([N (18O)sample / N (16O)sample] – [N (18O)VSMOW-SLAP / N (16O)VSMOW-SLAP]) / [N (18O)VSMOW-SLAP / N (16OVSMOW-SLAP)] 
VSMOW-SLAP refers to the Vienna SMOW-SLAP δ-scales, which are defined by assigning δ2H and δ18O values of 0 ‰ 
to VSMOW2 (RM 8535a) and values of –427.5 ‰ (δ2H) and –55.50 ‰ (δ18O) to measurements of SLAP (RM 8537) for 
the purpose of normalizing stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope measurements (see “Normalization”) [2-4]. 
 
Expiration  of  Value  Assignment:    RM 8536  is  valid,  within  the  measurement  uncertainty  specified,  until 
31 December 2020, provided the RM is handled and stored in accordance with instructions given in this Report of 
Investigation  (see  “Instructions  for  Handling,  Storage,  and  Use”).    The  report  is  nullified  if  the  RM  is  damaged, 
contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of RM:  NIST will monitor this RM over the period of its validity.  If substantive technical changes occur 
that affect the value assignment before the expiration of this report, NIST will notify the purchaser.  Registration (see 
attached sheet) will facilitate notification.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
Storage and Stability:  The original, unopened ampoules of RM 8536 should be stored at ambient temperature in the 
dark.  The unused fractions of this RM should be discarded after opening due to the strong possibility of evaporative 
losses causing significant isotope fractionation.  Furthermore, aliquots of this RM should not be used for repeated 
calibrations by repeated stable isotope measurements using water/CO2 equilibration devices over multiple days due to 
isotopic  exchange  with  the  applied  gas  and  resulting  shift  of  the  isotopic  composition  of  the  material  during  the 
preparation process.  The reference values in this Report of Investigation apply only to freshly opened ampoules. 
 
Use:  GISP is intended as a calibration check of working standards that are normalized to the VSMOW-SLAP scale. 
 
Distribution:  The distribution of GISP (RM 8536) is limited to one unit per year.  Users are strongly advised to prepare 
their  own  standards  for  daily  use  and  calibrate  those  standards  against  the  international  reference  materials 
VSMOW2 (RM 8535a) and SLAP (RM 8537). 
 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS 
 
Sample Preparation:  GISP was prepared by W. Dansgaard, University of Copenhagen, Denmark from a sample of 
Greenland firn [3]. 
 
Isotope-Number  Ratios  in  GISP:    The  δ2H  and  δ18O  isotope-number  ratios  of  GISP  were  derived  from  two 
interlaboratory comparison exercises.  After eliminating outliers, the average δ2H and δ18O values of the screened data 
together with their standard deviations and standard uncertainties were reported to the IAEA in 1984 and 1995 [5,6].  The 
results of those two studies are listed in the first two rows of Table 2.  The δ2H and δ18O isotope-number ratios listed in 
the third row are a statistical re-evaluation of both data sets combined, using an interquartile range rejection criterion to 
eliminate outliers.  The values in this last row are the values for GISP presented in Table 1.

Information Values:  The [N(17O)/N(16O)] ratio of GISP has been measured [7].  The average δ17O value, normalized to 
the VSMOW/SLAP scale, is –12.71 ‰.  The expanded uncertainty for this measurement is  0.1 ‰. 
 
Homogeneity:    The  isotopic  homogeneity  of  the  ampoules  was  checked  before  distribution  of  the  samples  in  the 
interlaboratory comparison exercise. These checks gave identical values within experimental uncertainty.

Normalization:  The δ-values for hydrogen and oxygen, when measured in samples, are presented as parts per thousand 
differences (per mill; ‰) from the VSMOW δ-value normalized with the defined SLAP δ-value.  The adoption of 
VSMOW as the zero point of the δ-scale and of a fixed SLAP δ-value by convention corresponds to the normalization of 
δ-values on the VSMOW–SLAP scale [3].  A general formula for normalizing hydrogen isotope measurement results 
using two laboratory standards LS1 (VSMOW2) and LS2 (SLAP) can be expressed as: 
 


2H sample,cal 2H LS1,cal  2H sample,WS 2H LS1,WS

 f    

(1) 

 
where the normalization factor f is: 
 


2H LS 2,cal 2H LS1,cal

f 



2H LS 2,WS 2H LS1,WS

 

 

(2) 

 
where   WS denotes measurements made versus a transfer gas (working standard),  

cal denotes calibrated measurements made versus the VSMOW–SLAP scale, and  
δ2H LS1,cal and δ2HLS2,cal are the conventionally fixed δ2H values for VSMOW2 and SLAP or those of calibrated 
laboratory working standards. 

 
Similar formulae are used for δ18O. 
 
The δ-definition of Eq. (1) is identical to the one in conventional use if and only if f = 1, that is if no scale compression 
occurs and the δ-values measured on a given instrument correspond exactly to the recommended values for δVSMOW2 and 
δSLAP. 
 
Please note that the reporting scales for δ2H and δ18O are still denoted and referred to as the VSMOW-SLAP scales in 
spite of the exhaustion of the original supply of VSMOW [8].  Therefore in Eq.1 and Eq.2, the measured values for the 
new  international  measurement  standards  VSMOW2  and  SLAP  are  entered  for  LS1  and  LS2.    The  data  are  then 
normalized to the VSMOW–SLAP scale using VSMOW2 and SLAP.  Of course, the standard uncertainties of VSMOW2 
and SLAP isotopic values have to be included in any uncertainty budget. 
 
Reporting  of  Stable  Isotope  δ-values:    The  following  recommendations  are  provided  for  reporting  the  relative 
difference of hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope-number ratios using the δ-notation modified from Coplen [9].  It is 
recommended that:  

 

 

 

δ2H values of all hydrogen-bearing substances be expressed relative to VSMOW-SLAP on a scale where 
δ2HSLAP = –427.5 ‰; 
δ18O values of all oxygen-bearing substances be expressed relative to VSMOW-SLAP or relative to VPDB (for 
carbonates) on a scale such that δ18O SLAP = –55.5 ‰ or δ18O NBS19 = –2.2 ‰, respectively;  
the  reporting  of  the  relative  difference  of  stable  isotope-number  ratios  relative  to  SMOW  and 
PDB (PeeDee Belemnite) be discontinued [10].
