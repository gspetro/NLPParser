Standard Reference Material 1928 

Standard 
Infrared Specular High Reflectance Standard 
(Nominal Diameter 51 mm) 
 
Sample
Serial Number:  Sample 

 
This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  calibrating  the  reflectance  scales  of  specular 
reflectometers  in  the  infrared (IR)  spectral  region  from  1.0 µm  to  18.0 µm  (555 cm-1  to  10,000 cm-1).    A  unit  of 
SRM 1928 consists of a specular finish gold plated copper disk, approximately 9.0 mm thick and 50.8 mm in diameter.  
Each unit is inscribed with an identifier number; the two digits after the left “/” of the inscription correspond to the 
serial number assigned by NIST.  SRM 1928 is shipped in an anodized aluminum container with protective inserts 
constructed in such a way as not to impinge upon the front surface of the mirror.   The SRM is placed with its front 
surface face down into the bottom half of the container. 
 
Certified  Reflectance  Values: 
  SRM 1928  was  measured  using  the  NIST  Fourier  Transform  Infrared 
Spectrophotometer  and  Infrared  Reference  Integrating  Sphere [1-5].    This  instrument  measures  reflectance  using 
absolute  techniques.    The  measurements  are  made  as  a  function  of  wavelength.    Each  unit  of  SRM 1928  is 
independently certified for a wavelength range of 1 µm to 18 µm.  This SRM is certified for specular reflectance for 
near-normal geometries, unpolarized incident light with an average angle of incidence on the sample between 0° and 
30°, and any incident geometry between f/1 and f/16, and any collection geometry from near zero solid angle up to 
the full reflected hemisphere.  For each unit of SRM 1928, at each wavelength, the certified value of the reflectance 
is given in absolute units (between 0 and 1).  The measurand is the regular reflectance measured as a function of 
wavelength (µm)  or  equivalent  wavenumber (cm-1).    Metrological  traceability  is  to  the  NIST  infrared  regular 
reflectance scale as described in NIST Special Publication 250-94 [1].  The values shown in Figure 1 of this certificate 
are  valid  for  the  ranges  mentioned  only.    The  certification  data  for  SRM 1928  Serial  Number  Sample  can  be 
downloaded at the NIST website at https://www-s.nist.gov/srmors/view_detail.cfm?srm=1928. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 1928 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until 31 December 2023, provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given in this 
certificate (see “Instructions for Handling, Storage and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, 
contaminated, exposed to excess humidity, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance of SRM Certification:  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its certification.  If substantive 
technical  changes  occur  that  affect  the  certification  before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST  will  notify  the 
purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet or register online) will facilitate notification. 
 
Overall direction and coordination of the technical measurements leading to certification were performed under the 
supervision of J.P. Rice and L.M. Hanssen of the NIST Sensor Science Division. 
 
Technical  measurements  leading  to  certification  were  performed  by  S.G. Kaplan  and  L.M. Hanssen  of  the  NIST

INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
Handling and Storage:  SRM 1928 is fragile and must be handled with care.  Airborne particulates, aromatics, and 
improper handling may adversely affect the surface conditions.  The SRM should always be handled carefully so 
that nothing is allowed to contact the bare gold surface, including fingers, other than any holder the user may require.  
Any holder should be designed such that any contact with the holder is limited to the outside edges away from the 
regions used for measurement.  Other than using a clean air bulb to gently remove dust from its front surface, the 
user should not attempt any other cleaning process, as such action may adversely affect the gold coating.  When not 
in use, SRM 1928 should be kept in its original container.  For storage, it is advisable to keep the SRM in a desiccator 
cabinet. 
 
Use:  The sample reflectance should be measured using unpolarized light at near normal incidence within the above 
specified  ranges.    A  measurement  of  a  sample  at  45°  incidence  using  polarized  light  showed  a  variation  of  up  to 
± 0.005 in reflectance for s or p polarization, but only 0.0005 for unpolarized light.  If the light source or detector 
system used for reflectance measurements have significant polarization content or sensitivity and the incidence angle 
is  greater  than  10°,  then  some  effort  should  be  made  to  depolarize  the  light  or  average  two  orthogonal  linear 
polarization measurements. 
 
Certification Data:  The certification data, as shown in Figure 1, is provided to the user in the form of a tab-delimited 
text  file.    The  data  is  in  columnar  format,  with  columns  for  wavenumber,  wavelength,  reflectance,  and  expanded 
uncertainty, respectively, over the entire spectral range in steps of 4 cm-1.

SOURCE, PREPARATION, AND ANALYSIS 
 
Source  and  Preparation:    The  SRM  samples  were  produced  by  Epner  Technology  Inc.  (Brooklyn, NY).(1)    The 
standard material is an electrodeposited proprietary gold coating over nickel over a polished copper disk.  
 
Certification Measurements:   Infrared  reflectance  measurements  were  performed using  a  Digilab 7000S  Fourier 
Transform  Spectrometer (FTS)  system  coupled  to  a  custom  integrating  sphere  apparatus.    The  instrument  room 
temperature was maintained at 23 °C ± l °C and the humidity ranged from 30 % to 50 % during the measurements.  
Measurements were made under a purge gas of clean air (with CO2 and H2O removed) at atmospheric pressure.  Details 
of the measurement methodology can be found in references 1, 4 and 5.  Spectral directional hemispherical reflectance 
was measured from 2.5 µm through 18.0 µm (555 cm-1 through 4000 cm-1) with the setup of the FTS in a  mid-IR 
mode  with  a  KBr  beamsplitter  and  a  SiC  “globar”  source,  and  in  a  near-IR  mode  from  1.0 µm  through  2.5 µm 
(4000 cm-1 through 10000 cm-1) with a quartz beamsplitter and a quartz-halogen light source.  The spectral resolution 
was  8 cm–1.    A  final  smoothing  was  applied  to  the  measured  reflectance  data,  resulting  in  an  effective  spectral 
resolution of 21 cm-1.  Measurements were performed with an f/6 cone centered on an average 8° angle of incidence 
with nominally unpolarized incident light.  The focus spot on the sample was 10 mm in diameter.  The detector was a 
liquid-nitrogen-cooled mercury-cadmium-telluride photoconductive element with a KCl lens and gold-coated non-
imaging  concentrator,  viewing  a  portion  of  the  inner  sphere  surface.    Additional  details  of  the  measurement 
instrumentation and methodology can be found in references 1-5.  
 
Uncertainty  Evaluation:    The  expanded  uncertainty,  U95%(x),  is  provided  for  each  certified  reflectance  value,  x,  
at  each  wavelength  and  shown  as  error  bars  in  Figure 1.    It  is  the  product  of  the  coverage  factor,  k = 2,  and  the 
combined  standard  uncertainty.    The  true  value  of  the  reflectance  x  is  believed  to  lie  within  x ± U95%(x)  with  an 
approximate 95 % confidence.  The combined standard uncertainty is the root sum of squares of all the uncertainty 
components [6–7].  Uncertainty components due to systematic effects are related to the FTS and interface optics and 
the integrating sphere system.  The uncertainties related to the spectrometer and interface optics are wavelength scale 
error,  phase  correction  error,  beam  geometry,  beam  polarization,  and  system  component  inter-reflections.  
Uncertainties  related  to  the  integrating  sphere  system  are  detector  nonlinearity,  overfill  of  the  integrating  sphere 
entrance and sample ports, nonequivalence of sample and reference alignment, atmospheric absorption variation, and 
the local spatial variations of the integrating sphere throughput.  Uncertainty components due to random effects are 
FTS source and alignment stability and detector noise.  The uncertainty contributions caused by these effects were 
evaluated by multiple measurements of the test items.  Details on the estimation of these uncertainties are given in 
Reference 5.

and Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment is the best available for the purpose
