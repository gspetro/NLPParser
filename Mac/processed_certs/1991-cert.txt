Certificate of Analysis 
Standard Reference Material® 1991 

 

 
Mixed Coal Tar/Petroleum Extract in Methylene Chloride 

 
This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended for use in evaluating analytical methods for the determination 
of  selected  polycyclic  aromatic  hydrocarbons (PAHs),  particularly  in  determining  relative  response  factors  for 
ASTM Method D7363-11  “Standard  Test  Method  for  Determination  of  Parent  and  Alkyl  Polycyclic  Aromatics  in 
Sediment Pore Water Using Solid-Phase Microextraction and Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry in Selected 
Ion  Monitoring  Mode” [1].    All  of  the  constituents  for  which  certified,  reference,  and  information  values  are 
provided are naturally present in the extract.  A unit of SRM 1991 consists of five ampoules each containing 1.2 mL 
of a methylene chloride solution. 
 
Certified  Mass  Fraction  Values:    Certified  mass  fraction  values  for  PAHs  are  provided  in  Table 1.    A  NIST 
certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in its accuracy in that all known or suspected 
sources  of  uncertainty  have  been  investigated  or  taken  into  account [2].    The  certified  values  are  based  on  the 
agreement of results obtained at NIST and the Energy and Environmental Research Center (EERC) at the University 
of North Dakota (Grand Forks, ND) using multiple analytical techniques. 
 
Reference Mass Fraction Values:  Reference mass fraction values are provided in Table 2 for additional PAHs and 
in  Table 3  for  groups  of  alkylated  PAHs.    Reference  values  are  noncertified  values  that  are  estimates  of  the  true 
values.  The values do not meet the NIST criteria for certification and are provided with associated uncertainties that 
may  reflect  only  measurement  precision,  may  not  include  all  sources  of  uncertainty,  or  may  reflect  a  lack  of 
sufficient statistical agreement among multiple analytical methods [2]. 
 
Information  Mass  Fraction  Values:    Information  mass  fraction  values  are  provided  in  Table 4  for  additional 
PAHs.    An  information  value  is  considered  to  be  a  value  that  will  be  of  interest  and  use  to  the  SRM  user,  but 
insufficient information is available to assess adequately the uncertainty associated with the value or only a limited 
number of analyses were performed [2]. 
 
Expiration of Certification:  The certification of SRM 1991 is valid, within the measurement uncertainty specified, 
until 30 September 2020 provided the SRM is handled and stored in accordance with the instructions given in this 
certificate (see “Instructions for Handling, Storage, and Use”).  The certification is nullified if the SRM is damaged, 
contaminated, or otherwise modified. 
 
Maintenance  of  SRM  Certification:    NIST  will  monitor  this  SRM  over  the  period  of  its  certification.    If 
substantive  technical  changes  occur  that affect  the  certification before  the  expiration  of  this  certificate,  NIST will 
notify the purchaser.  Registration (see attached sheet) will facilitate notification. 
 
Overall  direction  and  coordination  of  technical  measurements  leading  to  certification  were  performed  by 
M.M. Schantz and L.C. Sander of the NIST Chemical Sciences Division. 
 
Analytical  measurements  at  NIST  were  performed  by  J.A. Murray  and  M.M. Schantz  of  the  NIST  Chemical 
Sciences Division and D.J. Miller and S.B. Hawthorne of the EERC. 
 
Evaluation of the data was provided by N.A. Heckert and A.L. Pintar of the NIST Statistical Engineering Division.  
 
Support  aspects  involved  in  the  issuance  of  this  SRM  were  coordinated  through  the  NIST  Office  of  Reference 
Materials.

Partial  funding  support  for  the  preparation  and  certification  of  this  SRM  was  provided  by  the  Electric  Power 
Research Institute (EPRI, Palo Alto, CA). 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING, STORAGE, AND USE 
 
Handling:    This  material  contains  PAHs  in  methylene  chloride,  many  of  which  have  been  reported  to  have 
mutagenic and/or carcinogenic properties and should be handled with care (see Material Safety Data Sheet).  Use 
proper disposal methods. 
 
Storage:  Sealed ampoules, as received, should be stored in the dark at temperatures between 10 °C and 30 °C. 
 
Use:  Samples for analysis (minimum sample size of 400 mg) should be withdrawn at 20 °C to 25 °C immediately 
after opening ampoules and should be processed without delay for the certified values in Table 1 to be valid within 
the stated uncertainties.  Certified values are not applicable to material stored in ampoules that have been opened 
longer than 4 minutes. 
 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS(1) 
 
Sample  Preparation:  The  mixed  coal  tar/petroleum  non-aqueous  phase  liquid (NAPL)  used  for  this  SRM  was 
received from  EERC.   A known  mass  of  the  mixed  coal  tar/petroleum  sample  was  diluted  with  a known  mass  of 
methylene chloride in a large glass carboy.  The diluted mixture was stirred overnight and ampouled under an argon 
headspace the following day.  Each 2 mL amber ampoule contains approximately 1.2 mL of the methylene chloride 
solution. 
 
Polycyclic  Aromatic  Hydrocarbons:    The  general  approach  used  for  the  value  assignment  of  the  PAHs  in 
SRM 1991 consisted of combining results from analyses using various combinations of chromatographic separation 
and detection techniques [3]. 
 
Three  sets  of  gas  chromatography/mass  spectrometry (GC/MS)  results,  designated  as  GC/MS (I)  through 
GC/MS (III), were obtained at NIST.  For GC/MS (I) analyses, duplicate test portions of 400 mg from 10 ampoules 
of  SRM 1991  were  transferred  to  individual  vials,  were  spiked  with  a  known  amount  of  an  internal  standard 
solution (see  below),  and  were  analyzed  on  the  GC/MS.    They  were  then  diluted  approximately  1:10 (volume 
fraction)  with  methylene  chloride  and  rerun  on  the  GC/MS.    Each  sample  was  analyzed  by  GC/MS  using  a 
0.25 mm i.d.  × 60 m  fused  silica  capillary  column  with  a  50 % (mole  fraction)  phenyl  methylpolysiloxane  phase 
(0.25 μm  film  thickness;  DB-17MS,  Agilent  Technologies,  Wilmington,  DE).    The  results  from  the  DB-17MS 
column are denoted as GC/MS (I). 
 
For the GC/MS (II) and GC/MS (III) determination of the PAHs, one test portion (400 mg, exact mass known) from 
each of six ampoules was transferred to a vial and spiked with a known amount of internal standard solution (see 
below).  The solutions were analyzed by GC/MS using a 0.25 mm i.d. × 60 m fused silica capillary column with a 
relatively  non-polar  proprietary  stationary  phase  (0.25 μm  film  thickness;  DB-XLB,  Agilent  Technologies).    The 
same  samples  were  analyzed  by  GC/MS  using  a  0.25 mm i.d.  × 15 m  fused  silica  capillary  column  with  a  50 % 
(mole fraction) liquid crystal polysiloxane phase (0.15 μm film thickness; LC-50, J&K Scientific, Milton, Ontario, 
Canada).  The results from the DB-XLB column are denoted as GC/MS (II) and those from the LC-50 column as 
GC/MS (III). 
 
For  the  methods  described  above,  selected  perdeuterated  PAHs  were  added  to  the  coal  tar  solution  as  described 
above for use as internal standards for quantification purposes. 
 
In addition to the analyses performed at NIST, SRM 1991 was analyzed by EERC using a method similar to that 
described in Hawthorne et al. [4].  These data were used as the fourth data set, GC/MS (IV), in the determination of 
the values for PAHs in SRM 1991. 
 
Homogeneity  Assessment  for  PAHs:    The  homogeneity  of  SRM 1991  was  assessed  by  analyzing  duplicate  test 
portions  of  400 mg  from  10 ampoules  selected  by  stratified  random  sampling  using  GC/MS (I).    No  differences 
among ampoules were observed for the PAHs at the 400 mg test portion size.  
 

                                                           

(1) Certain  commercial  equipment,  instruments,  or  materials  are  identified  in  this  certificate  to  adequately  specify  the 
experimental procedure.  Such identification does not imply recommendation or endorsement by NIST, nor does it imply that the 
materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the purpose.

Certified  Mass  Fraction  Values:    The  certified  values  are  weighted  means  of  average  mass  fractions,  with  one 
average  from  each  of  two  or  more  analytical  methods [5,6].    The  expanded  uncertainty  is  the  half  width  of  a 
symmetric  approximately 95 %  parametric  bootstrap  confidence  interval [7],  which  is  consistent  with  the  ISO 
Guide [8,9].  The effective coverage factor, k, is included in the table for each PAH.

Reference Mass Fraction Values for PAHs:  The reference values are weighted means of average mass fractions, 
with one average from each of two or more analytical methods [5,6], when available.  The expanded uncertainty is 
the half width of a symmetric approximately 95 % parametric bootstrap confidence interval [7], which is consistent 
with the ISO Guide [8,9].  For PAHs analyzed by only one method, the reference mass fraction value is the mean of 
results obtained using that analytical technique.  The expanded uncertainty, U, is calculated as U = kuc, where uc is 
one  standard  deviation  of  the  analyte  mean,  and  the  coverage  factor,  k,  is  determined  from  the  Student’s 
t-distribution corresponding to the associated degrees of freedom and a 95 % confidence level for each analyte.  The 
effective coverage factor k is included in the table for each PAH.
