Description:    This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  was  primarily  intended  for  use  in  preparing  oil  solutions 
with known concentrations of sodium.  SRM 1069b is essentially free from other metals and has suitable properties 
for  use  with  most  lubricating  oils  or  petroleum  products.    A  unit  of  SRM 1069b  consists  of  5 g  of  sodium 
cyclohexanebutyrate powder. 

Other Designations:  Cyclohexanebutanoic acid, sodium salt; cyclohexanebutyric acid, sodium salt (1) 

Substance:  Sodium Cyclohexanebutyrate

4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  Give artificial respiration if not breathing.  
Get immediate medical attention. 

Eye  Contact:    Flush  eyes  with  copious  amounts  of  water  for  at  least  15 minutes.    Get  medical  attention,  if 
necessary. 

Skin Contact:  Wash affected area with soap and water for at least 15 minutes.  Seek medical attention, if needed.  
Thoroughly clean and dry contaminated clothing and shoes before reuse. 

Ingestion:  If a large amount is swallowed, get medical attention. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Negligible fire hazard. 

Extinguishing Media:  Use extinguishing agents appropriate for surrounding fire. 

Fire  Fighting:    Avoid  inhalation  of  material  or  combustion  byproducts.    Wear  full  protective  clothing  and 
NIOSH-approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA).

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Occupational Release:  Collect spilled material in appropriate container for disposal. 

Disposal:  Refer to Section 13, “Disposal Considerations”. 

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Handling and Storage:  Store and handle in accordance with all current regulations and standards.  Keep separated 
from incompatible substances. 

Safe Handling Precautions:  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”. 

8.  EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

Exposure Limits: 

OSHA (TWA):  15 mg/m3 (total dust for particulates not otherwise regulated) 
OSHA (TWA):  5 mg/m3 (respirable dust for particulates not otherwise regulated) 

Ventilation:  Use local exhaust ventilation system.  Ensure compliance with applicable exposure limits.  Refer to 
the ACGIH document, Industrial Ventilation, a Manual of Recommended Practices. 

Respirator:    If  workplace  conditions  warrant  a  respirator,  a  respiratory  protection  program  that  meets 
OSHA 29 CFR 1910.134 must be followed.  Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators. 

Eye Protection:  Wear chemical safety goggles.  An eyewash station should be readily available near areas of use. 

Personal Protection:  Wear appropriate chemical resistant clothing and gloves to prevent skin exposure.
