The Standard Reference Material (SRM),   
for  which  you  have  requested  a  Material  Safety  Data  Sheet  (MSDS)  is  not  hazardous  and/or  is  excluded  from 
coverage in our regular MSDS system for one or more of the following reasons. 
 
 
1 

The  SRM  is  an  article,  as  the  word  is  defined  by  the  Occupational  Safety  and  Health 
Administration  (OSHA)  of  the  U.S.  Department  of  Labor  in  paragraph  (c)  of  part  1910.1200  of 
title  29  of  the  Code  of  Federal  Regulations  (29  CFR  1910.1200)  which  does  not  release  or 
otherwise result in exposure to a hazardous chemical, under normal conditions of use. 

168  Heat-Resisting Alloy (S-816) 

 

The  SRM  has  been  determined  to  be  non-hazardous  by  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and 
Technology (NIST) of the U.S. Department of Commerce under paragraph (d) of OSHA Standards 
29 CFR Part 1910.1200.  The SRM will not release or otherwise result in exposure to a hazardous 
chemical under normal conditions of use. 

The SRM is a pesticide or hazardous waste labeled according to regulations issued by the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 

The SRM is a food, food additive, drug, or clinical material labeled according to regulations issued 
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 

The  SRM  is  a  wine  labeled according  to regulations  issued  by  the  Bureau  of Alcohol,  Tobacco, 
Firearms and Explosives (ATF) within the U.S. Department of Justice.  

The  SRM  is  a  radioactive  material  labeled  according  to  regulations  issued  by  the  U.S.  Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission (NRC). 

The SRM is a tobacco or tobacco product, wood or wood product which is exempted by OSHA 
under paragraph (b) (6) (iii) and (iv) of Standards 29 CFR Part 1910.1200. 

The SRM is a chipped material that is not regulated by either OSHA or the American Conference 
of Government  Industrial  Hygienists  (ACGIH).    As  manufactured,  the material’s  average  size  is 
above  the  inhalation  particulate  size  (100  micrometers  or  100  microns)  as  established  by  the 
ACGIH, Appendix D.  Should further processing of this material be done which would reduce the 
average particulate size to less than 100 micrometers, please refer to OSHA Respiratory Protection 
Standards 29 CFR Part 1910.134 for proper protection. 

The  SRM  is  a  particulate  matter  that  requires  inhalation  protection  by  OSHA  because  the 
material’s average particulate size, as manufactured, is less than the inhalation average particulate 
size established by the ACGIH, Appendix D (particulates with average particulate sizes less than 
100 micrometers or less than 100 microns require proper inhalation/respiratory protection).  Please 
refer to OSHA Respiratory Protection Standards 29 CFR Part 1910.134 for proper protection.
