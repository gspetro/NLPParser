4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Description of First Aid Measures  

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to well-ventilated (uncontaminated) area.  If breathing is difficult, 
qualified personnel may administer oxygen.  If not breathing, qualified personnel should give artificial respiration.  
Seek immediate medical attention.  

Skin Contact:  Rinse affected skin with water for at least 15 minutes and then wash thoroughly with soap or mild 
detergent and water.  If skin irritation persists, seek medical aid and bring the container or label. 

Eye Contact:  Immediately flush eyes, including under the eyelids, with copious amounts of water for at least 
15 minutes.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Ingestion:  Aspiration hazard; do not induce vomiting.  If vomiting occurs, keep head lower than hips to help 
prevent aspiration.  Get immediate medical attention. Give artificial respiration if not breathing. 

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed 

Inhalation:  Irritation, cough, ringing in the ears, nausea, chest pain, headache, drowsiness, dizziness, disorient, 
hyperactivity, mood swings, loss of coordination, bluish skin color, lung congestion, convulsions, and coma. 

Skin Contact:  Irritation, absorption; long-term exposure may result in blood disorders.  

Eye Contact:  No information available. 

Ingestion:    Gastrointestinal  irritation,  vomiting,  diarrhea,  stomach  pain,  irregular  heartbeat,  headache, 
drowsiness, dizziness, loss of coordination, coma, aspiration hazard. 

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above 
symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention.

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Moderate fire hazard.  Vapor/air mixtures are explosive above the flash point.  Vapors 
or gases may ignite at distant ignition sources and flash back.  Electrostatic discharges may be generated by flow or 
agitation  resulting  in  ignition  or  explosion.    See  Section  9,  “Physical  and  Chemical  Properties”  for  flammability 
properties. 

Extinguishing Media 
 
 

Suitable:  Regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide, water, or regular foam. 
Unsuitable:  None listed. 

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  Not applicable. 

Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Move container from fire area if it can be done 
without personal risk.  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion by-products.  Wear full protective clothing and 
NIOSH-approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe) 
 

Reactivity = 0 

Health = 2 

Fire = 2 

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Use suitable protective equipment; 
see Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.  Keep out of waters supplies and sewers. 

Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Avoid heat, flames, sparks and other sources of ignition.  
Stop leak if possible without personal risk, with water spray to reduce vapors.  Absorb spilled material with sand or 
non-combustible material and collect in appropriate container for disposal.  

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Safe Handling Precautions:  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”. 

Storage and Incompatible Materials:  Store in a well-ventilated area.  Keep separated from incompatible substances 
(oxidizing materials and halogens).   

8.  EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

Exposure Limits  
OSHA (PEL): 
ACGIH (TLV): 

 
NIOSH (REL): 

No occupational exposure limits listed. 
200 mg/m3 TWA, application restriction to conditions in which there are negligible aerosol 
exposures, total hydrocarbon vapors. 
Skin – potential significant contribution to overall exposure by the cutaneous route. 
100 mg/m3 TWA 

Engineering Controls:   Provide  local  exhaust  or  process  enclosure  ventilation  system.  Ensure  compliance  with 
applicable exposure limits. 

Protection Measures:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I.  Wear appropriate Personal Protective 
Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material. 

Respiratory  Protection:    If workplace conditions warrant a  respirator, a  respiratory protection program that 
meets OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.   Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators. 
Eye Protection:  Splash resistant safety goggles and emergency eyewash are recommended.  Provide emergency 
eyewash fountain and quick drench shower in the immediate work area. 
Skin and Body Protection:  Chemical resistant clothing and gloves are recommended.

Potential Health Effects (Acute, Chronic, and Delayed) 

Inhalation:  Irritation hazard is low unless heated or misted.  High concentrations of vapor or mist may cause 
irritation and possibly systems of central nervous system  depression.  Prolonged contact  may cause irritation, 
bronchitis, and pneumonia. 

Skin Contact:  May cause defatting of the skin resulting in dryness, irritation, dermatitis and edema.   

Eye Contact:  No adverse effects reported. 

Ingestion:  If aspirated, lung damage and death may occur.  Ingestion may cause irritation or burning sensation 
in  digestive  tract  and  other  digestive  discomfort.    In  large  quantities,  central  nervous  system  depression  may 
occur.
