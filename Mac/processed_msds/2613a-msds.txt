2613a 
Carbon Monoxide in Air (Nominal Amount-of-Substance Fraction 20 µmol/mol) 

Recommended Use of This Material and Restrictions of Use 

This  Standard  Reference  Material  (SRM)  is  a  primary  gas  mixture  of  carbon  monoxide  in  air  supplied  in  a 
DOT 3AL specification aluminum (6061 alloy) cylinder with a water volume of 6 L.  This SRM is intended for 
the calibration of instruments used for carbon monoxide determinations and for other applications.  Mixtures are 
shipped with a nominal pressure exceeding 12.4 MPa (1800 psig), which provides the user with 0.73 m3 (25.8 ft3) 
of useable mixture.  The cylinder is the property of the purchaser and is equipped with a CGA-350 brass valve, 
which is the recommended outlet for this carbon monoxide mixture.

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration 
or oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Skin Contact:  Wash skin with soap and water for at least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing and 
shoes. Get medical attention, if needed. 

Eye Contact:  Immediately flush eyes, including under the eyelids with copious amounts of water for at least 
15 minutes.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Ingestion:  Ingestion of a gas is unlikely.  As this product is a gas, refer to the inhalation section. 

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  Harmful if inhaled, blood damage, difficulty breathing, 
and suffocation. 

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above 
symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention.   

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Negligible fire hazard applicable to the identified NIST cylinder.  Cylinders may rupture 
or explode if exposed to heat.  See Section 9, “Physical and Chemical Properties” for flammability properties. 

Extinguishing Media: 
 
 

Suitable:  Use extinguishing media appropriate to the surrounding fire. 
Unsuitable:  None listed. 

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  Oxides of nitrogen, oxides of carbon. 

Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Move cylinder from fire area if it can be done 
without personal risk.  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion byproducts.  Wear full protective clothing and 
NIOSH approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA).

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Personal  Precautions,  Protective  Equipment  and  Emergency  Procedures:    Immediately  contact  emergency 
personnel.  Keep unnecessary personnel away.  Use suitable protective equipment; see Section 8, “Exposure Controls 
and Personal Protection”.  Shut off gas supply if this can be done safely.  Isolate area until gas has dispersed.  

Methods  and  Materials  for  Containment  and  Clean  up:    Stop  leak  if  possible  without  personal  risk.    Isolate 
hazard area and deny entry.  Stay upwind and keep out of low areas. 

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Safe Handling Precautions:  Use only with adequate ventilation.  Do not puncture or incinerate container.  Close valve 
after each use and when empty.  Keep valve protection cap on cylinder when not in use.   

Storage:    Store  and  handle  in  accordance  with  all  current  regulations  and  standards.    Secure  cylinder  to  prevent 
physical damage.  Keep separated from incompatible substances (oxidizing materials, halogens, metal oxides, metals, 
combustible  materials,  lithium).    Store  in  well-ventilated  area.    Subject  to  storage  regulations,  OSHA 
29 CFR 1910.101.
