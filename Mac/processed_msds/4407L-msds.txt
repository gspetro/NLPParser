Product Identifier 

SRM Number:    4407L 
SRM Name:  Iodine-125 Radioactivity Standard 
Other Means of Identification: Not applicable.   

Recommended Use of This Material and Restrictions of Use 

A unit of Standard Reference Material (SRM) 4407L consists of solution of a standardized and certified quantity 
of  radioactive  iodine-125  in  a  suitably  stable  and  homogeneous  matrix.    The  solution  is  contained  in  a  5 mL 
flame-sealed borosilicate-glass ampoule in a plastic vial in a lead shield.  This SRM is intended primarily for the 
calibration  of  instruments  that  are  used  to  measure  radioactivity  and  for  the  monitoring  of  radiochemical 
procedures.

Warning:    THIS  MATERIAL  SHOULD  ONLY  BE  USED  BY  PERSONS  QUALIFIED  TO  HANDLE 
RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL!   

This product contains licensed radioactive material and is therefore subject to the requirements of 10 CFR Part 20 
(e.g., public and occupational exposure limits, waste disposal).  At a minimum, the basic radiation safety principles 
of  time,  distance,  and  shielding,  and  appropriate  radiation  contamination  control  should  be  practiced  to 
avoid/minimize any external and/or internal exposure.  Consult with your Radiation Safety office for your facility’s 
radiation safety requirements/precautions specific to the radionuclide(s) (including its activity and chemical/physical 
form) in this Radioactive SRM. 

SRM 4407L is a radioactive material, Iodine-125, with a total activity of approximately 5 MBq.  Iodine-125 
decays by electron capture, and during the decay process, X-rays and gamma rays with energies from 4 keV to 
36 keV  are  emitted.    THIS  SRM  SHOULD  ONLY  BE  USED  BY  PERSONS  QUALIFIED  TO  HANDLE 
RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL!

4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Description of First Aid Measures:  

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration 
or oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Skin Contact:  Rinse affected area with copious amounts of water followed by washing with soap and water for 
at least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing.  Seek medical attention, if needed. 

Eye Contact:  Immediately flush eyes, including under the eyelids with copious amounts of water for at least 
30 minutes.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Ingestion:  Contact a poison control center immediately for instructions.  Wash out mouth with water, but do not 
induce vomiting.  Seek medical aid at once, and bring the container or label.
