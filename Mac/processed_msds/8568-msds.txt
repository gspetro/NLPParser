4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Description of First Aid Measures:  

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration 
or oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Skin Contact:  Wash skin with soap and water for at least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing and 
shoes.  Get medical attention if needed.  Thoroughly clean and dry contaminated clothing before reuse.  

Eye Contact:  Immediately flush eyes, including under the eyelids with copious amounts of water for at least 
15 minutes.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Ingestion:  If a large amount is swallowed, get medical attention. 

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed: Skin, eye, and respiratory irritation; cyanosis. 

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above 
symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention.   

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Negligible fire hazard.   Oxidizer, contact with combustible  materials  may enhance 
combustion;  risk  of  fire  or  explosion  on  contact  with  reducing  agents.    See  Section  9,  “Physical  and  Chemical 
Properties” for flammability properties. 

Extinguishing Media: 
 
 

Suitable:  Water or other appropriate media. 
Unsuitable:  None listed. 

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  None listed. 

Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion 
byproducts.  Wear full protective clothing and NIOSH approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA).

Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Do not touch spilled material.  Notify safety personnel 
of spills.  Absorb with sand or other non-combustible material.  Collect spilled material in appropriate container for 
disposal.  Isolate hazard area and deny entry. 

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Safe  Handling  Precautions:    Use  methods  to  minimize  dust.    See  Section  8,  “Exposure  Controls  and  Personal 
Protection”. 

Storage:    Store  and  handling  in  accordance  with  all  current  regulations  and  standards.    Keep  separated  from 
incompatible substances; see Section 10, “Stability and Reactivity” for incompatible substances. 

8.  EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

Exposure Limits: 

NIOSH (REL): 
ACGIH (TLV): 
OSHA (PEL): 
 
 

No exposure limits established for potassium nitrate. 
No exposure limits established for potassium nitrate. 
15 mg/m3 (TWA, total dust); 5 mg/m3 (TWA, respirable fraction);  
Particulates not otherwise regulated. 
 

Engineering Controls:   Provide  local  exhaust  or  process  enclosure  ventilation  system.  Ensure  compliance  with 
applicable exposure limits. 

Personal Protection:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal Protective 
Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material. 

Respiratory Protection:    If workplace conditions warrant a respirator, a respiratory protection program that 
meets  OSHA 29CFR  1910.134  must  be  followed.    Refer  to  NIOSH  42  CFR  84  for  applicable certified 
respirators. 

Eye/Face Protection:  Wear splash resistant safety goggles with a face shield.  An eye wash station should 
be readily available near areas of use. 

Skin and Body Protection:  Personal protective equipment for the body should be selected based on the 
task being performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a specialist before handling this 
product.  Chemical-resistant gloves should be worn at all times when handling chemicals.
