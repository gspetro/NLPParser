Note:    This  material  contains  inorganic  compounds  which  have  been  reported  to  have  toxic,  mutagenic,  and/or 
carcinogenic properties and should be handled with care.  The inorganic compounds are reported as oxides, but are 
not freely available in the material as sold.  Health and safety information associated with these oxides is provided 
as a reference for the user.  For actual concentrations, see the Certificate of Analysis. 

Major Health Hazards:  May cause respiratory tract irritation and lung damage.  Cancer hazard (in animals). 

Physical Hazards:  There are no known physical hazards associated with this material. 

Potential Health Effects (Acute and Chronic) 

Inhalation:  Exposure may cause respiratory irritation.  Repeated or prolonged exposure may result in cough, 
weight loss, chest pain, difficulty breathing, bluish skin color, metal fume fever, lung damage, and cancer. 

Skin Contact:  Exposure to intact skin may cause irritation. 

Eye Contact:  Particulates may cause mechanical irritation. 

Ingestion:  Ingestion of this material may result in irritation.
