Product Identifier 

SRM Number:    4401L 
SRM Name:  Iodine-131 Radioactivity Standard 
Other Means of Identification: Not applicable.   

Recommended Use of This Material and Restrictions of Use 

A unit of Standard Reference Material (SRM) 4401L consists of solution of a standardized and certified quantity 
of radioactive iodine-131 in a suitably stable and homogeneous matrix.  The solution is contained in a 5 mL flame 
sealed borosilicate-glass ampoule.  This SRM is intended primarily for the calibration of instruments that are used 
to measure radioactivity and for the monitoring of radiochemical procedures.

Warning:    THIS  MATERIAL  SHOULD  ONLY  BE  USED  BY  PERSONS  QUALIFIED  TO  HANDLE 
RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL!   

This product contains licensed radioactive material and is therefore subject to the requirements of 10 CFR Part 20 
(e.g., public and occupational exposure limits, waste disposal).  At a minimum, the basic radiation safety principles 
of  time,  distance,  and  shielding,  and  appropriate  radiation  contamination  control  should  be  practiced  to 
avoid/minimize any external and/or internal exposure.  Consult with your Radiation Safety office for your facility’s 
radiation safety requirements/precautions specific to the radionuclide(s) (including its activity and chemical/physical 
form) in this Radioactive SRM. 

SRM 4401L is a radioactive material, Iodine-131, with a massic activity of approximately 5 MBq•g‐1 in water. 
Iodine-131 decays by beta-particle emission to excited levels of Xe-131 including the isomeric state Xe-131m. 
During the decay process, X-rays and gamma rays with energies from 3 keV to 723 keV are also emitted.

4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Description of First Aid Measures:  

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration 
or oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Skin Contact:  Rinse affected area with copious amounts of water followed by washing with soap and water for 
at least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing.  Seek medical attention, if needed. 

Eye Contact:  Immediately flush eyes, including under the eyelids with copious amounts of water for at least 
30 minutes.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Ingestion:  Contact a poison control center immediately for instructions.  Wash out mouth with water, but do not 
induce vomiting.  Seek medical aid at once, and bring the container or label. 

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  Not applicable. 

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above 
symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention.
