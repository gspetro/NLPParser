Product Identifier 

SRM Number:  2700 
SRM Name:  Hexavalent Chromium in Contaminated Soil (Low Level) 
Other Means of Identification:  Not applicable. 

Recommended Use of This Material and Restrictions of Use 

This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended primarily for use in the analysis of waste, soils, sediments, 
or  other  materials  of  a  similar  matrix.    SRM  2700  is  a  soil,  contaminated  with  chromite  ore  processing 
residue (COPR)  that  has  been  air-dried,  sieved,  radiation-sterilized,  and  blended  to  achieve  a  high  degree  of 
homogeneity.  A unit of SRM 2700 consists of approximately 75 g of material in an amber screw-caped glass 
bottle.

Symptoms  Related  to  the  Physical,  Chemical  and  Toxicological  Characteristics:    Generated  dust  may  cause 
irritation, if inhaled.  May cause irritation, lung damage, silicosis, and cancer. 

Potential Health Effects (Acute, Chronic and Delayed): 

Inhalation:  Generated dust may cause irritation.  Chromite dust has produced pneumoconiosis. Inhalation of 
dust may cause coughing, sneezing, upper respiratory tract irritation, and lung damage.  Chronic exposure to fine 
particles containing respirable quartz may result in lung damage, silicosis, and cancer.
