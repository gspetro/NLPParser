		(Nominal AmountofSubstance Fraction 5 nmol/mol)

		Other Means of Identification:  Not Applicable.

	Recommended Use of This Material and Restrictions of Use

This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is a primary gas mixture of nonmethane hydrocarbon (NMHC) in nitrogen supplied in a DOT 3ALspecification aluminum (6061 alloy) cylinder with a water volume of 6 L.  Mixtures are shipped with a nominal pressure exceeding 12.4 MPa (1800 psig), which provides the user with 0.73 m3 (25.8 ft3) of useable mixture.  The cylinder is the property of the purchaser and is equipped with a CGA350 stainless steel valve, which is the recommended outlet for this NMHC mixture.

4. FIRST AID MEASURES

Description of First Aid Measures: 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration or oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention.

Skin Contact:  Not applicable.

Eye Contact:  Immediately flush eyes, including under the eyelids with copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes.  Seek immediate medical attention.

Ingestion:  Ingestion of a gas is unlikely.

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  Potentially fatal if inhaled.

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention.  

5. FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Negligible fire hazard applicable to the identified NIST cylinder.  Cylinders may rupture or explode if exposed to heat.  See Section 9, “Physical and Chemical Properties” for flammability properties.

Extinguishing Media:

		Suitable:  Use extinguishing media appropriate to the surrounding fire.

		Unsuitable:  None listed.

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  not applicable.

Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Move cylinder from fire area if it can be done without personal risk.  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion byproducts.  Wear full protective clothing and NIOSH approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA).

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe)

				Health = 1	Fire = 0	Reactivity = 0

6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Immediately contact emergency personnel.  Keep unnecessary personnel away.  Use suitable protective equipment; see Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.  Shut off gas supply if this can be done safely.  Isolate area until gas has dispersed. 

Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Stop leak if possible without personal risk.  Isolate hazard area and deny entry.  Ventilate closed spaces before entering.

7. HANDLING AND STORAGE

Safe Handling Precautions:  Secure cylinder to prevent physical damage.  Close valve after each use and when empty.  Keep value protection cap on cylinder when not in use.  

Storage:  Store and handling in accordance with all current regulations and standards.  Keep separated from incompatible substances.  Store in well-ventilated area.  Subject to storage regulations, OSHA 29 CFR 1910.101.

8. EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION

Exposure Limits

		Nitrogen

ACGIH (TLV):  Simple asphyxiant.

Engineering Controls:  Provide local exhaust or process enclosure ventilation system.  Ensure compliance with applicable exposure limits.

Personal Protection Measures:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material.

Respiratory Protection:  If workplace conditions warrant a respirator, a respiratory protection program that meets OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.  Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators.

Eye/Face Protection:  Wear splash resistant safety goggles with a face shield. An eye wash station should be readily available near areas of use.

Skin and Body Protection:  Personal protective equipment for the body should be selected based on the task being performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a specialist before handling this product. Chemical-resistant gloves should be worn at all times when handling chemicals.

Route of Exposure:

Inhalation



Skin



Ingestion

Symptoms Related to the Physical, Chemical and Toxicological Characteristics:  Nausea, headache, weakness, drowsiness.

Potential Health Effects (Acute, Chronic and Delayed):

Inhalation:  Nitrogen:  Nitrogen compressed gas is a simple asphyxiant.  Release in an enclosed space may result in asphyxiation.  The symptoms of asphyxia depend on the rapidity with which the oxygen deficiency develops and how long it continues.  In sudden acute asphyxia, unconsciousness may be immediate.  With slow development, there may be rapid respiration and pulse, air hunger, dizziness, reduced awareness, tightness in the head, tingling sensations, incoordination, faulty judgment, emotional instability, and rapid fatigue.  As the asphyxia progresses, nausea, vomiting, collapse, unconsciousness, convulsions, deep coma, and death are possible. 

Skin Contact:   No adverse effects reported.

Eye Contact:  No adverse effects reported.

Ingestion:  Ingestion of a gas is unlikely under normal conditions of use.
