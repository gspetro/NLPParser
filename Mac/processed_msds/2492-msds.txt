Exposure Limits for Quartz: 

ACGIH (TLV): 

0.025 mg/m3 (TWA) [respirable fraction] 

OSHA (PEL):  
 
 

(30)/(%SiO2 + 2) mg/m3 (TWA) [total dust] 
(250)/(%SiO2 + 5) mppcf (TWA) [respirable fraction] 
(10)/(%SiO2 + 2) mg/m3 (TWA) [respirable fraction] 

NIOSH (REL): 
 

0.05 mg/m3 (TWA) [respirable dust] 
50 mg/m3 (IDLH) [respirable dust] 

Engineering Controls:   Provide  local  exhaust  or  process  enclosure  ventilation  system.  Ensure  compliance  with 
applicable exposure limits. 

Personal Protection:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal Protective 
Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material. 

Respiratory Protection:    If workplace conditions warrant a respirator, a respiratory protection program that meets 
OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.   Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators. 

Eye/Face Protection:  Wear splash resistant safety goggles with a face shield.  An eyewash station should be readily 
available near areas of use. 

Skin and Body Protection:  Personal protective equipment for the body should be selected based on the task being 
performed  and  the  risks  involved  and  should  be  approved  by  a  specialist  before  handling  this  product.  
Chemical-resistant gloves should be worn at all times when handling chemicals.
