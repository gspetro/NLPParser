SAFETY DATA SHEET 

 
1.  SUBSTANCE AND SOURCE IDENTIFICATION  

Product Identifier 

SRM Number:   3074 
SRM Name:  Phthalates in Methanol 
Other Means of Identification:  Not applicable. 

Recommended Use of This Material and Restrictions of Use 

This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is a solution of one adipate and six phthalates in methanol intended 
primarily  for  use  in  the  calibration  of  chromatographic  instrumentation  used  for  the  determination  of  the 
certified components in the mixture.  Because of its miscibility with water, this SRM can also be used to fortify 
samples with known amounts of the six phthalates.  A unit of SRM 3074 consists of five 2 mL ampoules, each 
containing 1.2 mL of solution.

4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Description of First Aid Measures  

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to well-ventilated (uncontaminated) area.  If breathing is difficult, 
qualified  personnel  may  administer  oxygen.    If  not  breathing,  qualified  personnel  should  give  artificial 
respiration.  Seek immediate medical attention.  
Skin Contact:  Rinse affected skin with water for at least 15 minutes, then wash thoroughly with soap or mild 
detergent and water.  If skin irritation persists, seek medical aid and bring the container or label. 
Eye Contact:  Immediately flush eyes, including under the eyelids, with copious amounts of water for at least 
15 minutes.  Seek immediate medical attention. 
Ingestion:  If ingested, seek medical attention. 

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed 

Inhalation:  Irritation, dizziness, tingling sensation, pain in extremities, tremors, loss of coordination, difficulty 
breathing,  irregular  heartbeat,  visual  disturbances,  blindness,  bluish  skin  color,  convulsions,  unconsciousness, 
and coma. 

Skin Contact:  Irritation.

Eye Contact:  Irritation. 

Ingestion:   Same as most important symptoms/effects listed under inhalation.  

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above 
symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Severe fire hazard.  Vapor/air mixtures are explosive above the flash point.  Vapors 
or gases may ignite at distant ignition sources and flash back.  See Section 9, “Physical and Chemical Properties” for 
flammability properties. 
Extinguishing Media 
 
 
Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  Not applicable. 
Special  Protective  Equipment  and  Precautions  for  Fire-Fighters:    Move  container  from  fire  area  if  it  can  be 
done without personal risk.  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion by-products.  Wear full protective clothing 
and NIOSH-approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA).

Methods  and  Materials  for  Containment  and  Clean  up:    Avoid  heat,  flames,  sparks  and  other  sources  of 
ignition.   Stop leak if possible  without personal risk,  with  water  spray to reduce vapors.  Absorb  spilled  material 
with sand or non-combustible material and collect in appropriate container for disposal.  

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Safe Handling Precautions:  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”. 
Storage  and  Incompatible  Materials:    Store  in  a  well-ventilated  area.    Keep  separated  from  incompatible 
substances (halo carbons, combustible materials, metals, oxidizing materials, halogens, metal carbide, bases, acids, 
and amines).

Potential for dermal absorption. 

Engineering Controls:   Provide  local  exhaust  or  process  enclosure  ventilation  system.  Ensure  compliance  with 
applicable exposure limits. 
Personal Protection Measures:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal 
Protective Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material.

meets  OSHA 29CFR 1910.134  must  be  followed.    Refer  to  NIOSH  42 CFR 84  for  applicable  certified 
respirators. 
Eye Protection:  Splash resistant safety goggles and emergency eyewash are recommended. 
Skin and Body Protection:  Chemical resistant clothing and gloves are recommended.
