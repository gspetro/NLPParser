4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Description of First Aid Measures:  

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration 
or oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Skin Contact:  Wash skin with soap and water. 

Eye Contact:  Flush eyes with water for at least 15 minutes.  If necessary, seek medical attention. 

Ingestion:  If adverse effects occur after ingestion, seek medical treatment. 

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  May cause irritation.  

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above 
symptoms are present, seek medical attention if needed. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Negligible fire hazard.  Stainless steel powder is not listed by OSHA as a combustible 
dust.  Avoid generating dust.  See Section 9, “Physical and Chemical Properties” for flammability properties. 

Extinguishing Media: 
 
 

Suitable:  Dolomite, dry powder for metal fires, dry sand, graphite, soda ash, sodium chloride. 
Unsuitable:  None listed. 

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  None listed. 

Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion 
byproducts.  Wear full protective clothing and NIOSH approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe)  

 

Health = 1 

Fire = 0 

Reactivity = 0 

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Personal  Precautions,  Protective  Equipment  and  Emergency  Procedures:    Any  accumulated  material  on 
surfaces should be removed and properly disposed of.  Use suitable protective equipment; see Section 8, “Exposure 
Controls and Personal Protection”. 

Methods  and  Materials  for  Containment  and  Clean  up:    Collect  spilled  material  in  appropriate  container  for 
disposal.  Clean up residue with a high-efficiency particulate filter vacuum.  Keep unnecessary people away, isolate 
hazard area and deny entry. 

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Safe Handling Precautions:  Minimize dust generation and accumulation on surfaces.  Routine housekeeping should 
be instituted to ensure that dusts do not accumulate on surfaces.  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal 
Protection”.

Storage:  Store and handling in accordance with all current regulations and standards.  Store in original container in 
a cool dry place. 

8.  EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

Exposure Limits:  No occupational exposure limits have been established for stainless steel powder.  This material 
is  a  particulate  matter  and  adequate  inhalation/respiratory  protection  should  be  used  to  minimize  exposure.    The 
exposure limits for Particulates Not Otherwise Regulated (PNOR) are applicable. 

OSHA (PEL):  15 mg/m3 (TWA, total dust) 
 

5 mg/m3 (TWA, respirable fraction) 

NIOSH (REL):  10 mg/m3 (TWA, total particulates) 

5 mg/m3 (TWA, respirable) 

Engineering Controls:   Provide  local  exhaust  or  process  enclosure  ventilation  system.  Ensure  compliance  with 
applicable exposure limits. 

Personal Protection:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal Protective 
Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material. 

Respiratory  Protection:    If workplace conditions warrant a  respirator, a  respiratory protection program that 
meets OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.   Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators. 

Eye/Face Protection:  Wear splash resistant safety goggles with a face shield.  An eye wash station should be 
readily available near areas of use. 

Skin and Body Protection:  Personal protective equipment for the body should be selected based on the task 
being performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a specialist before handling this product.  
Chemical-resistant gloves should be worn at all times when handling chemicals.

Symptoms  Related  to  the  Physical,  Chemical  and  Toxicological  Characteristics:    Generated  dust  may  cause 
irritation if inhaled. 

Potential Health Effects (Acute, Chronic and Delayed): 

Inhalation:  The particle size of this material, 75 µm to 710 µm, is above the respirable range.  Inhalation of dust 
may cause irritation to the upper respiratory tract due to mechanical action.  Chronic exposure to respirable dust 
may result in accumulation of metal particles in the lungs. 

Skin Contact:  May cause mechanical irritation. 

Eye Contact:  May cause mechanical irritation.  Chronic exposure may cause conjunctivitis. 

Ingestion:  Ingestion of significant amounts of this material are unlikely under normal conditions of use.  This 
material does not pose a significant risk of exposure to iron, chromium, nickel or silicon through ingestion.
