4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Description of First Aid Measures:  

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  Give artificial respiration if not breathing.  
Get immediate medical attention. 

Skin Contact:  Wash skin with soap and water for at least 15 minutes.  If necessary, seek medical attention. 

Eye Contact:  Flush eyes with water for at least 15 minutes.  If necessary, seek medical attention. 

Ingestion:  If a large amount is swallowed, get medical attention. 

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  Generated dust may cause mechanical irritation. 

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above 
symptoms are present, seek medical attention if needed. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Negligible fire hazard.  Avoid generating dust.  See Section 9, “Physical and Chemical 
Properties” for flammability properties. 
Extinguishing Media 

Suitable:  Use extinguishing agents appropriate for the surrounding fire. 
Unsuitable:  None listed. 

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  Not applicable. 
Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Move container from fire area if it can be done 
without personal risk.  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion by-products.  Wear full protective clothing and 
NIOSH-approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe) 
 

Reactivity = 0 

Health = 1 

Fire = 0 

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Any accumulated material on surfaces 
should be removed and properly disposed of.  Use suitable protective equipment; see Section 8, “Exposure Controls 
and Personal Protection”. 
Methods  and  Materials  for  Containment  and  Clean  up:    Collect  spilled  material  in  appropriate  container  for 
disposal.  Avoid generating dust.  Clean up residue with a high-efficiency particulate filter vacuum. 

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Safe Handling Precautions:  Use suitable personal protection equipment (PPE).  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls 
and Personal Protection”. 
Storage and Incompatible Materials:  Store and handle in accordance with all current regulations and standards.  
Keep separated from incompatible substances (see Section 10, “Stability and Reactivity”). 

8.  EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

 
Exposure Limits: This material is a particulate matter and adequate inhalation/respiratory protection should be used 
to minimize exposure. 

ACGIH (TLV):  5 mg/m3 as Zr TWA (related to Zirconium compounds) 
 

10 mg/m3 STEL (related to Zirconium compounds) 

NIOSH (REL):  5 mg/m3 TWA (except zirconium tetrachloride) (related to Zirconium compounds) 
10 mg/m3 STEL (except zirconium tetrachloride) (related to Zirconium compounds) 
 
25 mg/m3 IDLH (except zirconium tetrachloride) (related to Zirconium compounds) 
 

OSHA (PEL): 

5 mg/m3 TWA (Zirconium compounds, as Zr) 

Engineering Controls:   Provide  local  exhaust  or  process  enclosure  ventilation  system.  Ensure  compliance  with 
applicable exposure limits.

Personal Protection Measures:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate PPE to 
minimize exposure to this material. 

Respiratory  Protection:    If workplace conditions warrant a  respirator, a  respiratory protection program that 
meets OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.   Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators. 

Eye/Face Protection:  Eye and face protection is required when dust is generated.  Wear splash resistant safety 
goggles.  Provide an emergency eye wash fountain and quick drench shower in the immediate work area. 

Skin and Body Protection:  Standard PPE is recommended to avoid irritation.

Symptoms  Related  to  the  Physical,  Chemical  and  Toxicological  Characteristics:    Generated  dust  may  cause 
mechanical irritation. 

Potential Health Effects (Acute, Chronic, and Delayed) 

Inhalation:  Inhalation of dust may cause irritation.  Industrial exposure has not resulted in respiratory or other 
pathological effects.  One study reported pulmonary granulomas in rabbits exposed to zirconium compounds.
