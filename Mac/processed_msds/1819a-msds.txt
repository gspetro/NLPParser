4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Description of First Aid Measures 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  Give artificial respiration if not breathing.  
Get immediate medical attention. 
Skin Contact:  Wash skin with soap and water for at least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing and 
shoes.  Get medical attention, if needed.  Thoroughly clean and dry contaminated clothing and shoes before reuse. 
Eye Contact:  Flush eyes with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes.  Then get immediate medical attention. 
Ingestion:  If a large amount is swallowed, get medical attention. 

Most  Important  Symptoms/Effects,  Acute  and  Delayed:    Exposure  may  irritate  the  eyes,  skin,  and  respiratory 
system. 

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above 
symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Minimal fire hazard; oil must be preheated before ignition will occur.  See Section 9, 
“Physical and Chemical Properties” for flammability properties. 
Extinguishing Media 

Suitable:  Use extinguishing agents appropriate to surrounding fire. 
Unsuitable:  None listed. 

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  Not applicable. 
Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Move container from fire area if it can be done 
without personal risk.  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion by-products.  Wear full protective clothing and 
NIOSH-approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe)

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Use suitable protective equipment; 
see Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”. 
Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Do not touch spilled material.  Absorb with sand or other 
non-combustible material and collect in appropriate container for proper disposal.  

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Safe Handling Precautions:  Use suitable personal protection equipment (PPE).  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls 
and Personal Protection”. 
Storage and Incompatible Materials:  Store and handle in accordance with all current regulations and standards.  
Keep separated from incompatible substances. 

8.  EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

Exposure Limits:  There are no occupational exposure limits established for lubricating base oil.  The exposure limits 
for mineral oil (CAS No. 8012-95-1) are provided below as a reference. 

OSHA (PEL): 
NIOSH (REL): 
 
 
ACGIH (TLV): 

 

5 mg/m3 (TWA) 
5 mg/m3 (TWA) 
10 mg/m3 (STEL) 
2.5 g/m3 (IDLH) 
5 mg/m3  (TWA, excluding metal working fluids, highly and severely refined, inhalable  
 

fractions) 

Engineering Controls:   Provide  local  exhaust  or  process  enclosure  ventilation  system.  Ensure  compliance  with 
applicable exposure limits.

Personal Protection Measures:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate PPE to 
minimize exposure to this material. 

Respiratory  Protection:    If workplace conditions warrant a  respirator, a  respiratory protection program that 
meets OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.   Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators. 

Eye Protection:  Splash resistant safety goggles and emergency eyewash are recommended. 

Skin and Body Protection:  Chemical resistant clothing and gloves are recommended.
