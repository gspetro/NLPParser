SRM Number:    2514 
SRM Name:    Wavelength Calibration Reference for 1560 nm to 1595 nm 
 

(Carbon Monoxide 12C16O) 

Under the U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.1200, 
this Standard Reference Material (SRM) is NOT classified as a physical hazard or a health hazard, a simple asphyxiant, 
combustible  dust,  pyrophoric  gas,  or  hazard  not  otherwise  classified.    There  are  no  hazard  pictograms,  hazard 
statements or signal word associated with it.  Safety Data Sheet information is not required.  This document may be 
used in conjunction with your hazard communication program. 
 
Exemption:    1910.1200  (c).    This  SRM  is  an  Article,  as  the  word  is  defined  by  OSHA,  where  Article  means  a 
manufactured item other than a fluid or particle: (i) which is formed to a specific shape or design during manufacture; 
(ii) which has end use function(s) dependent in whole or in part upon its shape or design during end use; and (iii) 
which under normal conditions of use does not release more than very small quantities, e.g., minute or trace amounts 
of a hazardous chemical (as determined under paragraph (d) of 1910.1200), and does not pose a physical hazard or 
health risk to employees.  
 
Description:  This SRM is intended for  wavelength calibration in the  spectral region  from 1560 nm to 1595 nm.  
SRM  2514  is  a  single-mode  optical-fiber-coupled  absorption  cell  containing  carbon  monoxide  (12C16O)  gas  at  a 
pressure of 133 kPa (1000 Torr).  The absorption path length is 80 cm and the absorption lines are about 50 pm wide.  
The cell is packaged in a small instrument box (approximately 32 cm long  12.5 cm wide  9 cm high) with two 
FC/PC fiber connectors for the input and output of a user-supplied light source.  This SRM can be used for calibrating 
a variety of wavelength-measuring instruments, such as optical spectrum analyzers, tunable lasers, and wavelength 
meters.   Carbon  monoxide  12C16O  has about 40 accurately  measured absorption lines  in the  1560 nm to 1595 nm 
wavelength region. 
 
Disposal:  SRM 2514 should be disposed of in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations. 
 
Transport  Information:    This  material  is  not  regulated  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  Transportation  (DOT)  and/or 
International Air Transportation Association (IATA).
