2.  HAZARDS IDENTIFICATION 

Description:    This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  to  be  used  to  calibrate  thermometers  near  39.30 ºC.  
SRM 1969  consists  of  approximately  154  grams  of  99.9+ %  pure  rubidium  in  all-welded  AISI  304  stainless  steel 
cell.   

NFPA Ratings (Scale 0–4): 

Health = 3 

Fire = 3 

Reactivity = 2 

Note:  This SRM is an article, as the word is defined by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the 
U.S. Department of Labor in paragraph (c) of part 1910.1200 of title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations (29 CFR 
1910.1200).  This material safety data sheet addresses the hazards of the rubidium component of the article and is 
provided for information purposes.   

Physical  Hazards:    Extremely  flammable.    May  ignite  spontaneously  on  exposure  to  air.    Reacts  violently  with 
water to generate toxic and/or flammable gases. 

Major Health Hazards:  Respiratory tract burns, skin burns, eye burns, mucous membrane burns. 

Potential Health Effects 

Inhalation:    On  contact  with  moisture,  rubidium  releases  flammable  hydrogen  gas  and  rubidium  hydroxide, 
which  is  corrosive.    Inhalation  of  corrosive  substances  may  cause  symptoms  of  respiratory  tract  irritation, 
possibly including coughing, choking, pain in the nose, mouth and throat and burns of the mucous membranes. 

Skin Contact:  Direct contact may cause severe pain, burns and possibly brownish stains. 

Eye  Contact:    Direct  contact  may  cause  pain  and  burns.    There  may  be  edema,  destruction  of  epithelium, 
corneal opacification and iritis. 

Ingestion:    Ingestion  of  rubidium  may  cause  inflammatory  and  ulcerative  changes  in  the  mouth  and  possibly 
bronchial and gastrointestinal disturbances.

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Occupational  Release:    Avoid  heat,  flames,  sparks  and  other  sources  of  ignition.    Do  not  get  water  directly  on 
material.  Small liquid spills: Absorb with sand or other non-combustible material.  Small dry spills: Collect material 
into suitable loosely covered container for disposal. 

Disposal:  Refer to Section 13, “Disposal Considerations”. 

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Storage:  Store and handle in accordance with all current regulations and standards.   

Safe Handling Precautions:  The valve on the SRM 1969 cell should never be opened nor should the plug on the 
end of the stainless steel tube be removed.  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”. 

8.  EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

Exposure Limits:  No occupational limits established. 

Ventilation:  Use a local exhaust ventilation system. 

Respirator: 
OSHA 29 CFR 1910.134 must be followed.  Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators 

  If  workplace  conditions  warrant  a  respirator,  a  respiratory  protection  plan 

that  meets 

Eye Protection:   Wear safety goggles.  An eyewash station should be readily available near areas of use. 

Personal Protection:  Wear appropriate protective clothing and gloves to prevent skin exposure. 

Appearance and Odor:  White solid, no odor information available.
