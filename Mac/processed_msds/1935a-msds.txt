4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

EC Risk/Safety Phrases:  Refer to Section 15, “Regulatory Information”. 

NOTE:  The EC classification for potassium dichromate varies based on the concentration. 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  Seek medical attention if needed. 

Skin  Contact:    Wash  exposed  skin  with  copious  amounts  of  water  for  at  least  15  minutes.    Remove  any 
contaminated clothing.  Seek medical attention if needed. 

Eye  Contact:    Immediately  flush  eyes  with  copious  amounts  of  water  for  at  least  15  minutes.    Seek  immediate 
medical attention. 

Ingestion: If swallowed do not induce vomiting.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Negligible fire hazard.

NIOSH (TWA):  0.001 mg/m3 (as Cr, related to Chromates). 
NIOSH (IDLH):  15 mg/m3 (as Cr, related to Chromates) 

Ventilation:  Use a local exhaust ventilation system. 

Respirator:    If  workplace  conditions  warrant  a  respirator,  a  respiratory  protection  program  that  meets 
OSHA 29 CFR 1910.134 must be followed.  Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators. 

Eye Protection:   Wear splash resistant safety goggles.  An eyewash station should be readily available near areas of 
use.
