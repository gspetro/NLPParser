SRM Number: 
SRM Name:    Whole Egg Powder 
Other Means of Identification:  Not applicable. 

1845a 

Recommended Use of This Material and Restrictions of Use 

This  Standard  Reference  Material  (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  validation  of  methods  for  determining 
proximates,  fatty  acids,  cholesterol,  vitamins,  elements,  and  amino  acids  in  whole  egg  powder  and  similar 
materials.  This SRM can also be used for quality assurance when assigning values to in-house reference materials.  
The SRM is a whole egg powder prepared by a commercial manufacturer.  A unit of SRM 1845a consists of five 
heat-sealed aluminized pouches, each containing approximately 10 g of material.

4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Description of First Aid Measures  

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to well-ventilated (uncontaminated) area.  If breathing is difficult, 
qualified personnel may administer oxygen.  If not breathing, qualified personnel should give artificial respiration.  
Seek immediate medical attention.  
Skin Contact:  Rinse affected skin thoroughly with soap or mild detergent and water for at least 15 minutes.   If 
skin irritation persists, seek medical aid and bring the container or label. 
Eye Contact:  Immediately flush eyes, including under the eyelids, with copious amounts of water for at least 
15 minutes.  Seek immediate medical attention. 
Ingestion:  If a large amount is swallowed, seek medical attention if concerned. 

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  No information available. 

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above 
symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Suitable:  Regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide, water, or regular foam. 
Unsuitable:  None listed. 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Slight fire hazard; sufficient concentrations of dust/air mixtures might ignite or explode 
if in the presence of an ignition source. 
Extinguishing Media 
 
 
Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  Not applicable. 
Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Move container from fire area if it can be done 
without personal risk.  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion by-products.  Wear full protective clothing and 
NIOSH-approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe) 
 

Reactivity = 0 

Health = 0 

Fire = 0 

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Use suitable protective equipment; 
see Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”. 
Methods and Materials for  Containment and Clean  up:  Avoid generating and accumulating dust.  Collect in 
appropriate container for disposal.  

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Safe Handling Precautions:  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”. 
Storage and Incompatible Materials:  Keep separated from incompatible substances and ignition sources.   

8.  EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

Exposure Limits:  No occupational exposure limits have been established for whole egg powder.  This material is a 
particulate matter and adequate inhalation/respiratory protection should be used to minimize exposure.  The exposure 
limits for Particulates Not Otherwise Regulated (PNOR) are applicable. 

OSHA (PEL):  15 mg/m3 (TWA, total particulates) 
OSHA (PEL):  5 mg/m3 (TWA, respirable particulates) 

NIOSH (REL):  10 mg/m3 (TWA, total particulates) 
NIOSH (REL):  5 mg/m3 (TWA, respirable particulates) 

Engineering Controls:   Provide  local  exhaust  or  process  enclosure  ventilation  system.  Ensure  compliance  with 
applicable exposure limits. 
Personal Protection Measures:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal 
Protective Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material. 

Respiratory  Protection:    If workplace conditions warrant a  respirator, a  respiratory protection program that 
meets OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.   Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators.
