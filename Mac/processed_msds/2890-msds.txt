Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration 
or oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Skin Contact:  Wash skin with soap and water for at least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing and 
shoes.  Get immediate medical attention.  Thoroughly clean and dry contaminated clothing before reuse. Destroy 
contaminated shoes. 

Eye Contact:  Immediately flush eyes, including under the eyelids with copious amounts of water for at least 
15 minutes.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Ingestion:  If vomiting occurs, keep head lower than hips to help prevent aspiration.  If person is unconscious, 
turn head to side.  Get medical attention immediately. 

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  Exposure may result in irritation.  

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above 
symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Moderate fire hazard.  The vapor is heavier than air.  Vapors or gases may ignite at 
distant ignition sources and flash back.  See Section 9, “Physical and Chemical Properties” for flammability properties. 

Extinguishing Media: 
 
 
 

Suitable:  Alcohol-resistant foam, carbon dioxide, regular dry chemical, water  
 
Unsuitable:  None listed. 

Large fires: Use alcohol-resistant foam or flood with fine water spray. 

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  Thermal decomposition will form oxides of carbon. 

Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion 
byproducts.  Wear full protective clothing and NIOSH approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe) 

 

Health = 1 

Fire = 2 

Reactivity = 0 

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Personal  Precautions,  Protective  Equipment  and  Emergency  Procedures:    Immediately  contact  emergency 
personnel.  Keep unnecessary personnel away.  Avoid heat, flames, sparks and other sources of ignition.  Remove 
sources of ignition.  Stop leak if possible without personal risk.  Use suitable protective equipment; see Section 8, 
“Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.

Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Reduce vapors with water spray.  Absorb with sand or 
other  non-combustible  material.  Collect  spilled  material  in  appropriate  container  for  disposal.    Collect  spilled 
material in appropriate container for disposal.  Isolate hazard area and deny entry.  

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Safe Handling Precautions:  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”. 

Storage:    Store  and  handling  in  accordance  with  all  current  regulations  and  standards.    Keep  separated  from 
incompatible substances (see Section 10, “Stability and Reactivity”). 

8.  EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

Exposure Limits:  No occupational exposure limits available.  

Engineering Controls:   Provide  local  exhaust  or  process  enclosure  ventilation  system.  Ensure  compliance  with 
applicable exposure limits. 

Personal Protection:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal Protective 
Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material. 

Respiratory  Protection:    If workplace conditions warrant a  respirator, a  respiratory protection program that 
meets OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.   Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators. 

Eye/Face Protection:  Wear splash resistant safety goggles with a face shield.  An eyewash station should be 
readily available near areas of use. 

Skin and Body Protection:  Personal protective equipment for the body should be selected based on the task 
being performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a specialist before handling this product.  
Chemical-resistant gloves should be worn at all times when handling chemicals.
