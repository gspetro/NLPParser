2.  HAZARDS IDENTIFICATION  

NFPA Ratings (Scale 0-4):  Health = 1 

Fire = 1 

Reactivity = 0 

Major Health Hazards:  Possible cancer hazard in humans. 

Physical Hazards:  There are no known physical hazards associated with this material. 

Potential Health Effects: 

Inhalation:  No information available on significant adverse effects. 

Skin  Contact:    Prolonged  or  repeated  skin  contact  may  cause  irritation  of  the  hair  follicles  and  block  the 
sebaceous glands.  Comedomes, perifollicular papules and pustules (oil boils) may develop.  Melanosis may 
appear later.  Repeated or prolonged contact may cause dermatitis due to defatting. 

Eye Contact:  No information available on significant adverse effects. 

Ingestion:  No information available on significant adverse effects.

4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration or 
oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Eye  Contact:    Immediately  flush  eyes,  including  under  the  eyelids  with  copious  amounts  of  water  for  at  least 
15 minutes.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Skin Contact:  Rinse affected area with copious amounts of water followed by washing with soap and water for at 
least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing and shoes.  Seek medical attention, if needed.  Thoroughly 
clean and dry contaminated clothing and shoes before reuse. 

Ingestion:  If a large amount is swallowed, seek immediate medical attention. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Slight fire hazard. 

Extinguishing Media:  Regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide, regular foam. 

Fire  Fighting:    Avoid  inhalation  of  material  or  combustion  byproducts.    Wear  full  protective  clothing  and 
NIOSH-approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 

Flash Point:  >93.3ºC (199.9 ºF) 
OSHA Flammability Class:  IIIB 

Autoignition Temp:  Not available. 

Flammability Limits in Air 
 
 

UPPER (Volume %):  Not available. 
LOWER (Volume %):  Not available. 

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Occupational  Release:    Stop  leak  if  possible  without  personal  risk.    Absorb  with  sand  or  other  non-combustible 
material.    Collect  spilled  material  in  appropriate  container  for  disposal.    Keep  unnecessary  people  away,  isolate 
hazard area and deny entry.  Keep out of water supplies and sewers. 

Disposal:  Refer to Section 13, “Disposal Considerations”. 

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Handling and Storage:  Store and handle in accordance with all current regulations and standards. 

Safe Handling Precautions:  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”. 

8.  EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

Exposure Limits:  2500 mg/m3 (vendor-supplied) 

Ventilation:  Use local exhaust ventilation system.  Ensure compliance with applicable exposure limits.  Refer to 
the ACGIH document, Industrial Ventilation, a Manual of Recommended Practices. 

Respirator:    If  workplace  conditions  warrant  a  respirator,  a  respiratory  protection  program  that  meets 
OSHA 29 CFR 1910.134 must be followed.  Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators. 

Eye Protection:  Wear splash resistant safety goggles.  An eyewash station should be readily available near areas of 
use. 

Personal  Protection:    Wear  appropriate  protective  clothing  and  chemically  resistant  gloves  to  prevent  skin 
exposure.
