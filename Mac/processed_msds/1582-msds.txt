4. FIRST AID MEASURES

Description of First Aid Measures 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  Give artificial respiration if not breathing.  Get immediate medical attention. 

Skin Contact:  Wash skin with soap and water for at least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing and shoes.  Get medical attention, if needed.  Thoroughly clean and dry contaminated clothing and shoes before reuse.

Eye Contact:  Flush eyes with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes.  Then get immediate medical attention.

Ingestion:  DO NOT induce vomiting.  If vomiting occurs, keep head lower than hips to help prevent aspiration. Get medical attention.

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  Irritation, cough, difficulty breathing, dermatitis.

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention.

5. FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Moderate fire hazard.  Vapor/air mixtures are explosive above the flash point.  See Section 9, “Physical and Chemical Properties” for flammability properties.

Extinguishing Media

		Suitable:  Regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide, water, or regular foam.

		Unsuitable:  Avoid using straight water streams in order to prevent frothing.

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  Not applicable.

Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Move container from fire area if it can be done without personal risk.  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion byproducts.  Wear full protective clothing and NIOSHapproved selfcontained breathing apparatus (SCBA).

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe)

				Health = 1	Fire = 2	Reactivity = 0

6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Use suitable protective equipment; see Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.  Keep out of waters supplies and sewers.

Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Avoid heat, flames, sparks and other sources of ignition.  Stop leak if possible without personal risk, with water spray to reduce vapors.  Absorb spilled material with sand or noncombustible material and collect in appropriate container for disposal. 

7. HANDLING AND STORAGE

Safe Handling Precautions:  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.

	Storage and Incompatible Materials:  Store in a wellventilated area.  Keep separated from incompatible substances (see Section 10, “Stability and Reactivity”).

8. EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION

Exposure Limits:

	Crude oil

	NIOSH (REL): 	350 mg/m3 (TWA)

		1800 mg/m3 (Ceiling, 15 min)

		1100 ppm (IDLH, 10 % LEL)

There are no occupational exposure limits established for crude oil by OSHA.  The exposure limit for oil mist is provided below as a reference.

	OSHA (PEL): 	5 mg/m3 (TWA)



Engineering Controls:  Provide local exhaust or process enclosure ventilation system.  Ensure compliance with applicable exposure limits.

Personal Protection Measures:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material.

Respiratory Protection:  If workplace conditions warrant a respirator, a respiratory protection program that meets OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.  Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators.

Eye Protection:  Splash resistant safety goggles and emergency eyewash are recommended.

Skin and Body Protection:  Chemical resistant clothing and gloves are recommended.
