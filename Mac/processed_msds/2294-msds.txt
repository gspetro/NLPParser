Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to well-ventilated (uncontaminated) area.  If breathing is difficult, 
qualified  personnel  may  administer  oxygen.    If  not  breathing,  qualified  personnel  should  give  artificial 
respiration.  Seek immediate medical attention.  

Skin Contact:  Rinse affected skin with water for at least 15 minutes, then wash thoroughly with soap or mild 
detergent and water.  If skin irritation persists, seek medical aid and bring the container or label. 

Eye Contact:  Immediately flush eyes, including under the eyelids, with copious amounts of water for at least 
15 minutes.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Ingestion:  Aspiration hazard.  Do not induce vomiting.  Contact local poison control immediately; if vomiting 
occurs, keep head lower than hips to prevent aspiration.  If unconscious, turn head to side; get medical attention 
immediately. 

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  Aspiration hazard, blood damage, liver damage, central 
nervous system depression, cancer hazard (in humans). 

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above 
symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention. 

5.  Fire Fighting Measures 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Severe fire hazard.  Vapor/air mixtures are explosive above the flash point.  Vapors 
or gases may ignite at distant ignition sources and flash back.  See Section 9, “Physical and Chemical Properties” 
for flammability properties. 

Extinguishing Media 
 
 

Suitable:  Regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide, water, or alcohol-resistant foam. 
Unsuitable:  None listed. 

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  Not applicable. 

Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for  Fire-Fighters:  Move container from fire area if it can be 
done without personal risk.  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion by-products.  Wear full protective clothing 
and NIOSH-approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe) 
 

Reactivity = 0 

Health = 3 

Fire = 3 

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Use suitable protective equipment; 
see Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.  Keep out of waters supplies and sewers. 

Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Avoid heat, flames, sparks and other sources of ignition.  
Stop leak if possible without personal risk, with water spray to reduce vapors.  Absorb spilled material with sand or 
non-combustible material and collect in appropriate container for disposal.

X 

Ingestion 

Symptoms Related to the Physical, Chemical and Toxicological Characteristics:  Skin irritation, eye irritation, 
central nervous system depression, and nerve damage. 

Potential Health Effects (Acute, Chronic, and Delayed) 

Inhalation:    Acute  exposure  may  result  in  irritation,  headache,  drowsiness,  dizziness,  vomiting,  sleep 
disturbances, emotional disturbances, tremors, loss of coordination, visual disturbances, chest pain, difficulty 
breathing,  irregular  heartbeat,  lung  congestion,  internal  bleeding,  blood  disorders,  kidney  damage,  liver 
damage, paralysis, brain damage, convulsions, unconsciousness, and coma.  Chronic exposure may result in 
the same effects as acute exposure but with changes in body temperature, changes in blood pressure, loss of 
appetite, menstrual disorders, nerve damage, reproductive effects, and cancer. 

Skin Contact:  Acute exposure may cause irritation, skin disorders.  Chronic exposure may cause irritation, 
skin disorders, tingling sensation, and allergic reactions. 

Eye Contact:  Exposure may result in irritation and other reversible effects. 

Ingestion:    Aspiration  hazard.    Exposure  may  cause  the  same  effects  as  listed  for  inhalation.    Repeated  or 
prolonged ingestion may result in reproductive effects and cancer.
