The Reference Material (RM), 
for  which  you  have  requested  a  Material  Safety  Data  Sheet (MSDS)  is  not  hazardous  and/or  is  excluded 
from coverage in our regular MSDS system for one or more of the following reasons:

8458  Artificial Flaws for Eddy Current Nondestructive Evaluation 

The  RM  is  an  article,  as  the  word  is  defined  by  the  Occupational  Safety  and  Health 
Administration  (OSHA)  of  the  U.S.  Department  of  Labor  in  paragraph  (c)  of  part 
1910.1200 of title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations (29 CFR 1910.1200 ) which does 
not  release  or  otherwise  result  in  exposure  to  a  hazardous  chemical,  under  normal 
conditions of use. 

 

The RM has been determined to be non-hazardous by the National Institute of Standards 
and  Technology  (NIST)  of  the  U.S.  Department  of  Commerce  under  paragraph  (d)  of 
OSHA Standards 29 CFR Part 1910.1200.  The RM will not release or otherwise result in 
exposure to a hazardous chemical under normal conditions of use. 

The RM is a pesticide or hazardous waste labeled according to regulations issued by the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 

The RM is a food, food additive, drug, or clinical material labeled according to regulations 
issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 

The  RM  is  a  wine  labeled  according  to  regulations  issued  by  the  Bureau  of  Alcohol, 
Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) within the U.S. Department of Justice.  

The  RM  is  a  radioactive  material  labeled  according  to  regulations  issued  by  the  U.S. 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). 

The  RM  is  a  tobacco  or  tobacco  product,  wood  or  wood  product  which  is  exempted  by 
OSHA under paragraph (b) (6) (iii) and (iv) of Standards 29 CFR Part 1910.1200. 

The  RM  is  a  particulate  matter  that  is  not  regulated  by  either  OSHA  or  the  American 
Conference  of  Government  Industrial  Hygienists  (ACGIH).    The  material’s  average 
particulate size, as manufactured, is above the inhalation particulate size (100 micrometers 
or  100  microns)  established  by  the  ACGIH,  Appendix  D.    Should  further  processing  of 
this  material  be  done  which  would  reduce  the  average  particulate  size  to  less  than  100 
micrometers,  please  refer  to  OSHA  Respiratory  Protection  Standards  29 CFR  Part 
1910.134 for proper protection.

The  RM  is  a particulate  matter  that requires  inhalation protection  by OSHA because the 
material’s  average  particulate  size,  as  manufactured,  is  less  than  the  inhalation  average 
particulate  size  established  by  the  ACGIH,  Appendix  D  (particulates  with  average 
particulate  sizes  less  than  100  micrometers  or  less  than  100  microns  require  proper 
inhalation/respiratory protection).  Please refer to OSHA Respiratory Protection Standards 
29 CFR Part 1910.134 for proper protection.
