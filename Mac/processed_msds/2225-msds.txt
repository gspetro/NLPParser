4. FIRST AID MEASURES

Description of First Aid Measures: 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration or oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention.

Skin Contact:  Wash skin with soap and water for at least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing and shoes.  Get immediate medical attention.  Thoroughly clean and dry contaminated clothing before reuse. Destroy contaminated shoes.

Eye Contact:  Immediately flush eyes, including under the eyelids with copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes.  Seek immediate medical attention.

Ingestion:  Contact a poison control center immediately for instructions.  If vomiting occurs, keep head lower than hips to prevent aspiration.  Seek immediate medical attention.

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:   Damage to the nervous system, kidneys, and lungs caused by mercury poisoning.

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention.

5. FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Negligible fire hazard.  See Section 9, “Physical and Chemical Properties” for flammability properties.

Extinguishing Media:

		Suitable:  Regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide, water, regular foam.

		Unsuitable:  None listed.

8. EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION

Exposure Limits:

	NIOSH (REL):	0.05 mg/m3 TWA as Hg vapor

			10 mg/m3 IDLH

			0.1 mg/m3 Ceiling

			Potential for dermal absorption (related to Mercury compounds)

	ACGIH (TLV):	0.025 mg/m3 TWA

	Skin - potential significant contribution to overall exposure by the cutaneous route

	OSHA (PEL):	0.1 mg/m3 Ceiling

Engineering Controls:  Provide local exhaust or process enclosure ventilation system.  Ensure compliance with applicable exposure limits.

Personal Protection:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material.

Respiratory Protection:  If workplace conditions warrant a respirator, a respiratory protection program that meets OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.  Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators.

Eye/Face Protection:  Wear splash resistant safety goggles with a face shield.  An eyewash station should be readily available near areas of use.

Skin and Body Protection:  Personal protective equipment for the body should be selected based on the task being performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a specialist before handling this product.  Chemical-resistant gloves should be worn at all times when handling chemicals.

Ingestion

Symptoms Related to the Physical, Chemical and Toxicological Characteristics:  Damage to the nervous system, kidneys, and lungs caused by mercury poisoning.

Potential Health Effects (Acute, Chronic and Delayed):

Inhalation:  Difficult breathing, headache, chest pain, cough, nausea, vomiting; at higher exposure levels, inflammation of the lungs, pulmonary edema, pneumothorax, central nervous system disturbances, and death.  Chronic exposure can also damage the kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, and reproductive system.

Skin Contact:  Exposure to intact skin may result in redness, pain, skin burns, and sensitization.  Long-term exposure may result in effects reported for chronic inhalation.

Eye Contact:  Exposure may cause eye redness, pain and blurred vision.
