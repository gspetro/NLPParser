3238 
Soy-Containing Solid Oral Dosage Form 

Recommended Use of This Material and Restrictions of Use 

This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  validation  of  methods  for  determining 
isoflavones in solid oral dosage forms containing soy and in similar matrices.  This SRM can also be used for 
quality  assurance  when  assigning  values  to  in-house  reference  materials.    A  unit  of  SRM 3238  consists  of 
5 packets, each containing approximately 2.6 g of material.

2.  HAZARDS IDENTIFICATION 

Note:  This processed material is intended for laboratory use only; not for human consumption.  SRM 3238 is supplied 
in a small quantity and under normal laboratory conditions it does not constitute a combustible dust  hazard.  The 
physical properties of this material indicate that accumulated dust on surfaces generated where operations produce 
fine particulates, may lead to combustible dust concentrations in air.

4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Description of First Aid Measures:  

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration 
or oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Skin Contact:  Wash skin with soap and water for at least 15 minutes.  Thoroughly clean and dry contaminated 
clothing before reuse. 

Eye Contact:  Flush eyes with water for at least 15 minutes.  If necessary, seek medical attention. 

Ingestion:  If adverse effects occur after ingestion, seek medical treatment. 

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  No data available; generated dust may cause soy flour 
related allergic reactions, and irritation. 

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above 
symptoms are present, seek medical attention if needed. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Avoid generating dust; sufficient concentrations of fine dust dispersed in air, and in the 
presence of an ignition source is a potential hazard.  See Section 9, “Physical and Chemical Properties” for flammability 
properties. 

Extinguishing Media: 
 
 

Suitable:  Use extinguishing media appropriate for surrounding fire. 
Unsuitable:  None listed. 

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  None listed. 

Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion 
byproducts.  Wear full protective clothing and NIOSH approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe) 

 

Health = 0 

Fire = 0 

Reactivity = 0 

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Personal  Precautions,  Protective  Equipment  and  Emergency  Procedures:    Any  accumulated  material  on 
surfaces should be removed and properly disposed of.  Use suitable protective equipment; see Section 8, “Exposure 
Controls and Personal Protection”. 

Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Do not touch spilled material.  Notify safety personnel 
of spills.  Collect spilled material in appropriate container for disposal.  Isolate hazard area and deny entry. 

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Safe Handling Precautions:  Minimize dust  generation and accumulation on  surfaces.   See Section 8,  “Exposure 
Controls and Personal Protection”. 

Storage:    Store  and  handling  in  accordance  with  all  current  regulations  and  standards.    Keep  separated  from 
incompatible substances. 

8.  EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

Exposure Limits:  This material is a particulate matter and adequate inhalation/respiratory protection should be used 
to minimize exposure.  No occupational exposure limits have been established for soy powder.  The exposure limits 
for Particulates Not Otherwise Regulated are applicable. 

OSHA (PEL):  15 mg/m3 (TWA, total particulates not otherwise regulated) 
 

5 mg/m3 (TWA, respirable particulates not otherwise regulated) 

Engineering Controls:   Provide  local  exhaust  or  process  enclosure  ventilation  system.  Ensure  compliance  with 
applicable exposure limits. 

Personal Protection:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal Protective 
Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material.

Respiratory Protection:    If workplace conditions warrant a respirator, a respiratory protection program that meets 
OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.   Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators. 

Eye/Face Protection:  Wear splash resistant safety goggles with a face shield.  An eye wash station should be readily 
available near areas of use. 

Skin and Body Protection:  Personal protective equipment for the body should be selected based on the task being 
performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a specialist before handling this product.  Chemical-
resistant gloves should be worn at all times when handling chemicals.
