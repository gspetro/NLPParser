SRM Number:  2961
MSDS Number:  2961
SRM Name:
Respirable Cristobalite on Filter Media
(Nominal Mass of Cristobalite, 5 µg)

Date of Issue:  05 April 2012 

Emergency Telephone ChemTrec: 

1-800-424-9300 (North America)
+1-703-527-3887 (International)

Description:    This  Standard  Reference  Material (SRM)  is  intended  primarily  for  the  calibration  of  X-ray 
diffraction (XRD)  spectrometers  for  the  determination  of  respirable  cristobalite  using  National  Institute  for 
Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Method 7500 [1], or the equivalent.  A unit of SRM 2961 consists of five 
polyvinyl chloride (PVC) filters, each containing a nominal mass of 5 g of respirable cristobalite, and five blank 
PVC filters containing no cristobalite. 

Substance:  Respirable cristobalite 

Other Designations:    Alpha-cristobalite;  cristobalite;  alpha-crystobalite;  crystoballite;  metacristobalite;  silica, 
crystalline-cristobalite; silicic anhydride; cristoballite 

2.  HAZARDS IDENTIFICATION  

NFPA Ratings (Scale 0-4):  Health = 1 

Fire = 0 

Reactivity = 0 

Major Health Hazards:  Cancer hazard (in humans). 

Physical Hazards:  There are no physical hazards associated with this material. 

Potential Health Effects (Acute and Chronic) 

Inhalation:  Inhalation of finely divided crystalline silica dust particles may cause physical discomfort of the 
respiratory tract.  Repeated or prolonged inhalation of dust particles may result in silicosis in a few weeks to 
six  months  depending  on  the  level  of  exposure.    Symptoms  may  include  coughing,  shortness  of  breath,  and 
weight loss.  Persons diagnosed with silicosis have an increased risk of developing lung cancer. 

Skin Contact:  Exposure may cause irritation of intact skin due to mechanical abrasion.  If the skin is abraded, 
a heavy growth of scar tissue may be induced. 

Eye Contact:  Exposure may cause irritation due to mechanical action. 

Ingestion:  Effects caused by ingestion are due to mechanical action as crystalline silicas are biologically inert.

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  Give artificial respiration if not breathing.  
Get immediate medical attention. 

Eye  Contact:    Flush  eyes  with  copious  amounts  of  water  for  at  least  15 minutes.    Get  medical  attention,  if 
necessary. 

Skin Contact:  Wash affected area with soap and water for at least 15 minutes.  Seek medical attention, if needed.  
Thoroughly clean and dry contaminated clothing and shoes before reuse. 

Ingestion:  If a large amount is swallowed, get medical attention. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Negligible fire hazard. 

Extinguishing Media:  Use extinguishing agents appropriate for surrounding fire. 

Fire  Fighting:    Avoid  inhalation  of  material  or  combustion  byproducts.    Wear  full  protective  clothing  and 
NIOSH-approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 

Flash Point:  Not applicable. 

Autoignition Temp: Not applicable.

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Occupational  Release:    Collect  spilled  material  in  appropriate  container  for  disposal.    Avoid  generating  dust.  
Clean up residue with a high-efficiency particulate filter vacuum.  Keep out of water supplies and sewers. 

Disposal:  Refer to Section 13, “Disposal Considerations”. 

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Handling and Storage:  Store and handle in accordance with all current regulations and standards.  Keep separated 
from  incompatible  substances.    Sealed  filters,  as  received,  should  be  stored  in  the  dark  at  temperatures  between 
15 °C and 25 ºC. 

Safe Handling Precautions:  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.

Ventilation:  Use local exhaust ventilation system.  Ensure compliance with applicable exposure limits.  Refer to 
the ACGIH document, Industrial Ventilation, a Manual of Recommended Practices. 

Respirator:    If  workplace  conditions  warrant  a  respirator,  a  respiratory  protection  program  that  meets 
OSHA 29 CFR 1910.134 must be followed.  Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators. 

Eye Protection:  Wear chemical safety goggles.  An eyewash station should be readily available near areas of use. 

Personal Protection:  Wear appropriate chemical resistant clothing and gloves to prevent skin exposure.
