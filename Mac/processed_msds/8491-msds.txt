SAFETY DATA SHEET



1. Substance and Source Identification 

	Product Identifier

		RM Number:	8491

		RM Name:	Sugarcane Bagasse Whole Biomass Feedstock

		Other Means of Identification:  Not applicable.

	Recommended Use of This Material and Restrictions of Use

This Reference Material (RM) is intended primarily for use in evaluating analytical methods for the determination of summative composition of lignocellulosic material.  The RM can also be used for quality assurance when assigning values to in-house control materials.  The whole herbaceous biomass material is derived from sugarcane bagasse (Saccharum spp.).  A unit of the RM consists of five single use Mylar bags of whole biomass, each containing approximately 10 g of material.

2. HAZARDS IDENTIFICATION

Note:  This processed material is intended for laboratory use only; not for human consumption.  RM 8491 is supplied in a small quantity and under normal laboratory conditions it does not constitute a combustible dust hazard.  The physical properties of this material indicate that accumulated dust on surfaces generated where operations produce fine particulates, may lead to combustible dust concentrations in air.

4. FIRST AID MEASURES

Description of First Aid Measures: 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration or oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention.

Skin Contact:  Wash skin with soap and water for at least 15 minutes.  Thoroughly clean and dry contaminated clothing before reuse.

Eye Contact:  Flush eyes with water for at least 15 minutes.  If necessary, seek medical attention.

Ingestion:  If adverse effects occur after ingestion, seek medical treatment.

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  Skin or eye mechanical irritation. 

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above symptoms are present, seek medical attention if needed.

5. FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Avoid generating dust; sufficient concentrations of fine dust dispersed in air, and in the presence of an ignition source is a potential hazard.  See Section 9, “Physical and Chemical Properties” for flammability properties.

Extinguishing Media:

		Suitable:  Regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide, water, and regular foam.

		Unsuitable:  None listed.

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  None listed.

Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion byproducts.  Wear full protective clothing and NIOSH approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA).

NFPA Ratings (0 = Minimal; 1 = Slight; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Serious; 4 = Severe)	

				Health = 0	Fire = 0	Reactivity = 0

6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Any accumulated material on surfaces should be removed and properly disposed of.  Use suitable protective equipment; see Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.

Methods and Materials for Containment and Clean up:  Do not touch spilled material.  Notify safety personnel of spills.  Collect spilled material in appropriate container for disposal.  Isolate hazard area and deny entry.

7. HANDLING AND STORAGE

Safe Handling Precautions:  Minimize dust generation and accumulation on surfaces.  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.

Storage:  Store and handling in accordance with all current regulations and standards.  Keep separated from incompatible substances (oxidizing materials).

8. EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION

Exposure Limits:  This material is a particulate matter and adequate inhalation/respiratory protection should be used to minimize exposure.  No occupational exposure limits have been established for sugarcane bagasse.  The exposure limits for Particulates Not Otherwise Regulated are applicable.

		OSHA (PEL):	15 mg/m3 (TWA, total particulates not otherwise regulated)

			5 mg/m3 (TWA, respirable particulates not otherwise regulated)

Engineering Controls:  Provide local exhaust or process enclosure ventilation system.  Ensure compliance with applicable exposure limits.

Personal Protection:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material.

Respiratory Protection:  If workplace conditions warrant a respirator, a respiratory protection program that meets OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.  Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators.

Eye/Face Protection:  Wear splash resistant safety goggles with a face shield.  An eye wash station should be readily available near areas of use.

Skin and Body Protection:  Personal protective equipment for the body should be selected based on the task being performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a specialist before handling this product.  Chemical-resistant gloves should be worn at all times when handling chemicals.
