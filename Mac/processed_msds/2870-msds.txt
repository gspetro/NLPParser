SRM Name:    Relative Permittivity and Loss Tangent  
 

1422 Cross-Linked Polystyrene 

 

Under the U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.1200, 
this  Standard  Reference  Material  (SRM)  is  NOT  classified  as  a  physical  hazard  or  a  health  hazard,  a  simple 
asphyxiant, combustible dust, pyrophoric gas, or hazard not otherwise classified.  There are no hazard pictograms, 
hazard statements or signal word associated with it.  Safety Data Sheet information is not required.  This document 
may be used in conjunction with your hazard communication program. 
 
Exemption:    1910.1200  (c).    This  SRM  is  an  Article,  as  the  word  is  defined  by  OSHA,  where  Article  means  a 
manufactured  item  other  than  a  fluid  or  particle:  (i)  which  is  formed  to  a  specific  shape  or  design  during 
manufacture; (ii) which has end use function(s) dependent in whole or in part upon its shape or design during end 
use; and (iii) which under normal conditions of use does not release more than very small quantities, e.g., minute or 
trace  amounts  of  a  hazardous  chemical  (as  determined  under  paragraph  (d)  of  1910.1200),  and  does  not  pose  a 
physical hazard or health risk to employees. 
 
Description:  This SRM  is intended  for the evaluation of  measurement systems  used  to characterize the relative 
permittivity and loss  tangent  of dielectric  materials.   A  unit of  SRM  2870 consists of a cross-linked polystyrene 
cylindrical disk, nominally 60 mm in diameter and 10 mm thick.  This specimen can be machined to the necessary 
geometry required by various measurement systems. 
 
Disposal:  SRM 2870 should be disposed of in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations. 
 
Transport  Information:    This  material  is  not  regulated  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  Transportation  (DOT)  and/or 
International Air Transportation Association (IATA).
