SAFETY DATA SHEET



1. Substance and Source Identification 

	Product Identifier

		SRM Number:	2958

		SRM Name:	Respirable Alpha Quartz on Filter Media

			(Nominal Mass of Alpha Quartz 1000 µg)

		Other Means of Identification:  Not applicable.

	Recommended Use of This Material and Restrictions of Use

This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended primarily for the calibration of X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrometers for the determination of respirable alpha quartz using National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Method 7500, or the equivalent.  The SRM was produced by depositing a known amount of SRM 1878a Respirable Alpha Quartz, as a slurry on a 25 mm diameter polyvinyl chloride (PVC) filter.  A unit of SRM 2958 consists of five filters, each containing a nominal mass of 1000 µg of respirable alpha quartz.  The SRM is provided with five blank PVC filters containing no alpha quartz.  The blank filters and the loaded filters are stored in two clear plastic petri dishes, respectively, with blue spacer sheets separating the filters.

4. FIRST AID MEASURES

Description of First Aid Measures: 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration or oxygen by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention.

Skin Contact:  Wash skin with soap and water for at least 15 minutes.  Thoroughly clean and dry contaminated clothing before reuse.

Eye Contact:  Flush eyes with water for at least 15 minutes.  If necessary, seek medical attention.

Ingestion:  If adverse effects occur after ingestion, seek medical treatment.

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  May cause irritation, lung damage, silicosis, and cancer. 

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above symptoms are present, seek medical attention if needed.

5. FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Negligible fire hazard.  See Section 9, “Physical and Chemical Properties” for flammability properties.
