chloride.  This SRM is intended primarily for use in the calibration of chromatographic instrumentation used for the 
determination of organic acids.  A unit of SRM 2278 consists of five 2 mL ampoules, each containing approximately 
1.2 mL of solution. 

Substance:  Methanol:Methylene Chloride 

Other Designations:  Methanol (methyl alcohol; wood alcohol; methyl hydroxide; carbinol; monohydroxymethane; 
wood  spirit;  wood  naphtha;  methylol)/Methylene  Chloride  (dichloromethane;  methylene  dichloride;  methane

4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration by 
qualified personnel.  If breathing is difficult, oxygen should be administered by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate 
medical attention.   

Skin  Contact:    Wash  affected  skin  with  soap  and  water  for  at  least  15  minutes  while  removing  contaminated 
clothing.  Seek medical attention, if needed. 

Eye  Contact:    Immediately  flush  eyes,  including  under  the  eyelids,  with  copious  amounts  of  water  for  at  least 
15 minutes.  Seek immediate medical attention. 

Ingestion:  If ingested, seek medical attention. 

5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Severe fire hazard.  The vapor is heavier than air.  Vapors or gases may ignite at 
distant ignition sources and flash back.  Vapor/air mixtures are explosive. 

Extinguishing Media:  Alcohol resistant foam, carbon dioxide, regular dry chemical, water.  

Fire  Fighting:    Move  container  from  fire  area  if  it  can  be  done  without  risk.    Avoid  inhalation  of  material  or 
combustion  by-products.    Wear  full  protective  clothing  and  NIOSH-approved  self-contained  breathing  apparatus 
(SCBA). 

Flash Point (°C):  11 (52 °F) 
Method Used:  Closed Cup 

Autoignition Temp. (°C):  385 (725 °F)

6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Occupational Release:  Stop leak if possible without personal risk.  Isolate hazard area and deny entry.  Avoid heat, 
flames,  sparks  and  other  sources  of  ignition.    Do  not  touch  spilled  material.    Reduce  vapors  with  water  spray.  
Absorb  with  sand  or  other  non-combustible  material.  Collect  spilled  material  in  appropriate  container  for  proper 
disposal. 

Disposal:  Refer to Section 13, “Disposal Considerations”. 

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Storage:    Store  and  handle  in  accordance  with  all  current  regulations  and  standards.    Keep  separated  from 
incompatible substances.  Store sealed ampoules in the dark at temperatures lower than 30 °C.  Subject to storage 
regulations:  U.S. OSHA 29 CFR 1910.106. 

Safe Handling Precautions:  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”.
