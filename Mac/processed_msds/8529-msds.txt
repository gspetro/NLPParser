4. FIRST AID MEASURES 

Description of First Aid Measures  

Inhalation:  If adverse effects occur, remove to well-ventilated (uncontaminated) area.  If breathing is difficult, 
qualified personnel may administer oxygen.  If not breathing, qualified personnel should give artificial respiration.  
Seek immediate medical attention.  
Skin Contact:  Rinse affected skin thoroughly with soap or mild detergent and water for at least 15 minutes.   If 
skin irritation persists, seek medical aid and bring the container or label. 
Eye Contact:  Immediately flush eyes, including under the eyelids, with copious amounts of water for at least 
15 minutes.  Seek immediate medical attention. 
Ingestion:  If a large amount is swallowed, seek medical attention. 

Most Important Symptoms/Effects, Acute and Delayed:  No information available. 

Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:  If any of the above 
symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention. 

5. FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 

Suitable:  Use extinguishing agents appropriate for surrounding fire. 
Unsuitable:  None listed. 

Fire and Explosion Hazards:  Negligible fire hazard. 
Extinguishing Media 
 
 
Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  Not applicable. 
Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters:  Move container from fire area if it can be done 
without personal risk.  Avoid inhalation of material or combustion by-products.  Wear full protective clothing and 
NIOSH-approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA).

6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:  Use suitable protective equipment; see 
Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”. 
Methods  and  Materials  for  Containment  and  Clean  up:    Avoid  generating  and  accumulating  dust.    Collect  in 
appropriate container for disposal.  

7. HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Safe Handling Precautions:  See Section 8, “Exposure Controls and Personal Protection”. 
Storage and Incompatible Materials:  Keep separated from incompatible substances. 

8. EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

Exposure  Limits:    No  occupational  exposure  limits  have  been  established  for  silver  sulfide.    This  material  is  a 
particulate matter and adequate inhalation/respiratory protection should be used to minimize exposure.  The exposure 
limits for Particulates Not Otherwise Regulated (PNOR) are applicable. 

5  mg/m3  TWA  (inhalable  fraction;  particulate  matter  containing  no  asbestos  and  <1  % 
crystalline silica) 

ACGIH (TLV): 

NIOSH (REL): 
 
OSHA (PEL): 
 
 

10 mg/m3 TWA (total dust) 
5 mg/m3 TWA (respirable dust) 
15 mg/m3 TWA (total dust) 
5 mg/m3 TWA (respirable fraction) 

Engineering  Controls:    Provide  local  exhaust  or  process  enclosure  ventilation  system.    Ensure  compliance  with 
applicable exposure limits. 
Personal Protection Measures:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal 
Protective Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material.

Respiratory  Protection:    If  workplace  conditions  warrant  a  respirator,  a  respiratory  protection  program  that 
meets OSHA 29CFR 1910.134 must be followed.  Refer to NIOSH 42 CFR 84 for applicable certified respirators. 

Eye Protection:  Splash resistant safety goggles and emergency eyewash are recommended. 

Skin and Body Protection:  Chemical resistant clothing and gloves are recommended.
