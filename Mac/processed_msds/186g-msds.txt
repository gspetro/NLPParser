This  Standard  Reference  Material  (SRM)  is  intended  for  use  in  preparing  solutions  for  calibrating 
electrodes for pH measuring systems.  A unit of SRM 186g consists of two components, each prepared 
to  ensure  high  purity  and  uniformity:  KH 2PO4,  Potassium  Dihydrogen  Phosphate  (186-I-g)  and 
Na2HPO4, Disodium Hydrogen Phosphate (186-II-g).  However, neither SRM component is certified for 
purity of substance.  A unit of SRM 186g consists of 30 g of potassium dihydrogen phosphate (186-I-
g) and 45  g  of  disodium  hydrogen  phosphate  (186-II-g), each contained in its respective clear glass 
bottle.

8.  EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 

Exposure Limits:  No occupational exposure limits have been established for potassium dihydrogen phosphate.  This 
material is a particulate matter and adequate inhalation/respiratory protection should be used to minimize exposure.  
OSHA Particulates Not Otherwise Regulated (PNOR) exposure limits apply. 

OSHA (PEL): 

15 mg/m3 (TWA, total dust) 
5 mg/m3 (TWA, respirable fraction) 

 

NIOSH (REL): 
 

15 mg/m3 (TWA, total dust) 
5 mg/m3 (respirable fraction) 

Engineering Controls:   Provide  local  exhaust  or  process  enclosure  ventilation  system.  Ensure  compliance  with 
applicable exposure limits. 

Personal Protection:  In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.132, subpart I, wear appropriate Personal Protective 
Equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure to this material. 

Respiratory Protection:    If workplace conditions warrant a respirator, a respiratory protection program that 
meets  OSHA 29CFR 1910.134  must  be  followed.    Refer  to  NIOSH  42 CFR 84  for  applicable  certified 
respirators. 

Eye/Face Protection:  Wear splash resistant safety goggles with a face shield.  An eye wash station should be 
readily available near areas of use. 

Skin and Body Protection:  Personal protective equipment for the body should be selected based on the task 
being performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a specialist before handling this product.  
Chemical-resistant gloves should be worn at all times when handling chemicals.
