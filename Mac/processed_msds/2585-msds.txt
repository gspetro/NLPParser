2585 
Organic Contaminants in House Dust 

Recommended Use of This Material and Restrictions of Use 

This  Standard  Reference  Material  (SRM)  is  intended  for  use  in  evaluating  analytical  methods  for  the 
determination of selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners, 
chlorinated pesticides, and polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners in house dust and similar matrices.  
All of the constituents for which certified, reference, and information values are provided in SRM 2585 were 
naturally present in the dust material before processing.  A unit of SRM 2585 consists of one bottle containing 
approximately 10 g of house dust.

Symptoms Related to the Physical, Chemical and Toxicological Characteristics:  Fatigue, weakness, anorexia, 
anemia, jaundice, encephalopathy. 

Potential Health Effects (Acute, Chronic and Delayed): 

Inhalation:  Exposure to dust may result in respiratory tract irritation.  Short term inhalation of lead may cause 
irritation,  nausea,  vomiting,  kidney  damage,  liver  damage.    Prolonged  exposure  to  lead  may  result  in  an 
accumulation in body tissues and exert adverse effects on the blood, nervous system, heart, endocrine and immune 
systems, kidneys, and reproduction.
