Acetylene 12C2H2 

Under the U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.1200, 
this  Standard  Reference  Material  (SRM)  is  NOT  classified  as  a  physical  hazard  or  a  health  hazard,  a  simple 
asphyxiant, combustible dust, pyrophoric gas, or hazard not otherwise classified.  There are no hazard pictograms, 
hazard statements or signal word associated with it.  Safety Data Sheet information is not required.  This document 
may be used in conjunction with your hazard communication program. 
 
Exemption:    1910.1200  (c).    This  SRM  is  an  Article,  as  the  word  is  defined  by  OSHA,  where  Article  means  a 
manufactured  item  other  than  a  fluid  or  particle:  (i)  which  is  formed  to  a  specific  shape  or  design  during 
manufacture; (ii) which has end use function(s) dependent in whole or in part upon its shape or design during end 
use; and (iii) which under normal conditions of use does not release more than very small quantities, e.g., minute or 
trace  amounts  of  a  hazardous  chemical  (as  determined  under  paragraph  (d)  of  1910.1200),  and  does  not  pose  a 
physical hazard or health risk to employees.  
 

Description:    This  SRM  is  intended  for  wavelength  calibration  in  the  spectral  region  from  1510 nm to  1540 nm.  
SRM 2517a is a single-mode optical-fiber-coupled absorption cell containing acetylene (12C2H2) gas at a pressure of 
6.7 kPa (50 Torr).  The absorption path length is 5 cm and the absorption lines are about 7 pm wide.  The cell is 
packaged in a small instrument box (approximately 24 cm long x 12.5 cm wide x 9 cm high) with two FC/PC fiber 
connectors for the input and output of a user-supplied light source. 
 
Disposal:  SRM 2517a should be disposed of in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations. 
 
Transport  Information:    This  material  is  not  regulated  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  Transportation  (DOT)  and/or 
International Air Transportation Association (IATA).
